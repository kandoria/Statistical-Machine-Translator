mr the president gentlemen mr programmes with the within would fact in the parliament the at the truth must we
this are we now i i a significant document the from has
the council the berlin has end agreed the upper for the budget the to to the
now is the commission the and the council like
the agenda says fact and this everything in a time which the expenditure for the balkans as know are increased
the to now to mentioned sum the million euro for serbia is even not in the near the the real needs
that amount is because already if conveyed spent in the campaign
the  has many destroyed and large suffering caused
the new political forces the here support find have now not only to task political work to out but must also the one up the the  has us the destroyed companies schools hospitals bridges etc they must now ensure for the reconstruction
i like here especially clear make that we the responsibility the us must take for the fate the all citizens the the country include the more than refugees in the federal republic yugoslavia
not only another country has so refugees included
the calls now the the parliament that the the  the the social area and the resources for the development limited despite the increasing poverty in the world
a thing is the now already clear the ability the the european union to the countries the central and eastern the to take is not only on the the institutional reforms this is i i in even still greater extent also a challenge for the act the the union
if the not another budgetary the will there with the accession the this countries in europe a still greater gap the the interests with the poverty
we have now not words and statements more need now must we if european union specific act social sensitivity the the day to and solidarity express the parliament will this are own contribution must make
i lending like this opportunity the to a short contribution to make the this important debate and to on to are the the important and the forum the the budget not only for the farmers but for the society in the general
who interested is in the development the a viable agricultural sector know that the recent reforms the in berlin are agreed mainly a further shift content the support for products to direct income for the farmers
the is therefore both a social if a economic measure the intended is to the prices in agreement to to with the the the market and same seeks the european model the family in the to the
what not always the mentioned is that this extensive line not only intended is if support for the farmers but also the european citizens in the the to cheap food to obtain
in certain agricultural sectors as the  is the eu the  so the consumer a quality stable diet can buy against cost and unfortunately sometimes also as in the last years is has include
in berlin is last year agreed that there the the budget a postal the more than billion gbp the aside for agriculture for the period and that the fifteen member the the european union the their gross national product will continue contribute the the total annual budget the are course measures understand to the enlargement the the european union to finance a proposal that i and my other mr programmes fully support
we are fully behind the concept the enlargement and the offer the financial support the countries to them to help to to act to the union
despite the made agreements question i i the agree the or this objectives feasible are within the existing budgetary without the budget the to really that need is to the agricultural sector in the current member in the to the
i think that we us in this respect must up if politicians the is not real to to think that we can perform in a situation which possible not resources available are to the economies the countries in central and eastern to develop the the way the the existing member like would see
fr mr the president gentlemen mr programmes for you the a frustrated member
frustrated because i after long debates in the committee and despite the regarding efforts the the general rapporteur the i all praise like my still still not exactly big what the parliament now really like with the crucial problem the the revision the the financial perspectives
large large are there two approaches the council the remind the that the aid the kosovo and serbia from the in berlin the budget financed must be without revision and the commission the for the financial perspectives to review so this aid financed can be without that there been favour the done the other policies and with particularly the the programme meda
to the date is this parliament always against redeployment within category been
therefore has the the always expressed for a revision the the financial perspectives
now have we the feeling that the parliament for the line remains fight but without really are teeth to let see
despite the most  proposal the the rapporteur have we a text adopted without the floor revision if the term  was become a type  that start with a h as there a  is that with a f start also are this not sums in if you can start to negotiate without sums to mention
i am concern and since i am to a group the the sometimes remember that they democratic is been would i want that we faith are the the floor the the  that your yes yes may are that your no no may are
president colleagues mrs the commissioner first and especially like i course all rapporteurs thank
i believe that they hard work have
the is any time again a europeanmediterranean to the  to a good end to to and i think that a congratulate here the are place is
a budget colleagues is however always more than a cold 
behind any figure behind any line behind any granted amount is a to to political policy are political objectives are huge expectations are especially also people
i i this the over two weeks the den who can affected during a  in the western balkans where i kosovo and bosnia i visited
and i was in pristina when kostunica in biarritz one was outpaced and underhanded and deserve million euro  was 
a political act best colleagues a political act mrs the commissioner the not the the  was received by the albanian kosovars
why said the i why makes the union not use the the  in serbia to permanent pressure to to the the new regime already was the but to without the people the in serbian prisons  free to to
and i say you very ready and clear kostunica must therefore here are opportunities to and i hope than also that he the next weeks or months will ensure for a amnesty but meantime like i the that there the the political and the the  the the introduction the the two new lines democratisation and reconstruction political conditions be linked
not money for serbia what i the without guarantee for more stability and a absolutely respect for the rights the kosovars for the rights the montenegro and for the respect the the region the november
because indeed my visit the bosnia has i learnt that the situation there very problematic is
already my partners this were welcome with the  in serbia but all also fear the reductions the financial resources
a euro can but one time be spent and i warn you colleagues and i warn also the absent council
there is in bosnia still very what work to oppose
think the the return the refugees and the the 
i i a project visited
the people have urgent money need and without  not reconstruction the housing and not economic viable make the this however the very fragile the
reductions the financial resources colleagues means over the the western balkans any more instability
i support therefore all attempts together with mr lagendijk to maximum resources in to to for the western balkans
when need must what us the category four reopened be and must we move to a revision the the financial perspectives
best colleagues i like not that europe a political  remains and i like still less a new war the the western balkans the less than kilometres the here
late us therefore if budgetary our political responsibility take
mr the president with the proposed budget has the council itself exceeded
although the needs quickly increase fails the council there each year again in a smaller budget the table to to
now are we not the the the gdp but even below the
that has dramatic consequences for the financing the the agricultural the social policy the employment the research and a series other sectors the the economic social and development the most regions areas the the union and the large population will this the suffer the be
if like the like is is the mr the president even immoral to  the the appropriations for the agricultural the meda and the social exclusion to resources free to can make for the financing the the obligations the the european union in kosovo and yugoslavia
the are not the farmers and the poor peoples the the mediterranean the the decision to the nato have taken why must they than the who pay for the damages damage
the damage in the balkans must be restore but this must those pay the its have caused
this budget can absolutely not by the unacceptable
the european parliament has but a means to the to show that the selfrespect has and the aware is the the feelings the the peoples in our countries and that is very the budget to reject as the proposed in the by our group tabled amendment
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i like only speak on a the part the this budget and the on serbia
the elections in yugoslavia have two things demonstrated the people have last enough the dictator milosevic and confidence the professor kostunica
the challenge which the new president is faced is same a challenge for us europeans
the process is just the start has
the  the the old serbian government and the training the a from experts existing government are together with the for december the this year planned new elections for the serbian parliament important conditions to just if in montenegro also in the serbian massively the old  nomenklatura the world from to help and the door to open for democratic changes
in the last ten days are already important institutional decisions taken
as was the yugoslav national bank independence guaranteed and is the  not longer a instrument the corruption
important is now also that the economic sanctions the the european union as quickly possible be withdrawn
commissioner patten the today in belgrade is must the proposal the the responsible the ground accept according what all economic sanctions must be lifted and the companies from the clique the the war the a black list must be the
if we want that the democratic forces the the elections success them and kostunica a good start makes must we something do
the economy the yugoslavia is in efforts
mr modrow is there although not more but he had fact must listen
this economy is especially in efforts because milosevic and are women markovic the same chairperson the the communist party and in certain sense  the a large mafia was and is the guilty have made the economic mismanagement
the economy is also destroyed by the sanctions the because milosevic the the country were imposed and only for a small part by the nato
the is simply had that a country that ever food  now are own population not can feed
the winter the for the door and there is a lack the gas oil and heating
the croatia parliament has after the election the kostunica per  the to the that at frozen prices released what to a  has led that can under the population to misunderstandings lead on the policy the kostunica although he the this decision total not influence has exercised
the political stability is or the with a improvement the the living
the is very simple in serbia should the people this winter not cold and not hunger suffering
therefore are we extremely pleased on the efforts the the mr programmes the the committee to the emergency the million euro for this year mr modrow not for next year but for this year that like say for the next half month smooth to draw
with this money can we demonstrate that europe the real partner in this region is
by the last elections are the democratic partners the local level hell increasing become we have therefore sufficient trustworthy people the that level
those the in serbia responsible are for the political and the economy emphasise time again that they not on want be the our aid but that they our aid now need have to the need the short term to relieve and that they than aid to  need have to the medium and long term a social market to can introduce and also the necessary foreign investment possible to make
i am welcome today to can hear that professor kostunica officially the crimes the are predecessors against the albanians has recognised and the responsibility this the the the
i am there certainly the that also the albanian political prisoners soon will be released
kostunica deserves our support
i am that convinced that the parliament my believe will parts if they here the november to kostunica has listened
that today parallel a decision the taken on million euro for the poor kosovo shows the that we by the new challenges the old not are forget
i hope the much i that we during the debate on the cards which there is the a financial commitment for already this countries demonstrated give the same commitment and each country that give what the s
for stability in the southern region are stable components need
mr the president i i only two short comments on the budget the not with other in the are
in the first place would i something want say on the still affordable to to sums  the us each year again conundrum costs of the fighting the the council in the cut the the appropriations to the absurd and am savings to achieve the as good are the the balance but in fact fact only but a socalled burden for the future create the clearly because themselves that we must meet the the in previous  commitments obligations
and the true not what the council us today has said that there never problems are been with the payments
that true not and i would the mr patriat there pleased the have out that the payments for the social fund in even were suspended because there a billion euro subjects the payments for the structural
that is more been
the implementation the the payments is always difficult has
also given also the fact that the commission itself has admitted that for the year the ask the the member to payments from the structural eight billion euro higher are hit than as estimated in the draft for budget think i that the high time is that the council there the the late our that there something must be done the the payments in place the the  to let up
moreover would i expression want give the my concern on the fact that the different  are included in the programme socrates
i from the exist the the parliaments not in doubt but there they the out that socrates is resulting from a legislative codecision the the parliament and the council decisions if this forms a serious precedent that in the future will lead to the into the the comment the the programme programmes the all other measures that elsewhere not the are place is
this means i i that the legislative for the approval the programme programmes the weakened and with particularly the content the the programme programmes
mr the president the is clear that the current financial perspectives not answer the the existing priorities and obligations
therefore must the parliament already the possible do to the council to to they for the new objectives new resources free to make and to avoid that this the expense the earlier the priorities be implemented
the european parliament has all right the the world to a revision the the financial perspectives to demands certainly now the council without was or  a  has tabled that us  with the  budget the the last ten year saddles
do we this not than will we inevitably our resort must take to financial theory made and cuts or the the general expenditure or the social and  or the the 
also will we despite however still on not resources for the balkans have to still but to silent the the horizontal reserve and the unacceptable cuts the the cooperation the cohesion and even the the support the timor although the european union with this country farreaching international obligations is made
course are there few aspects the our approval while under more the conservation the the financial resources the for the development
that change however nothing the the fact that the proposed  on the whole taken negative scored
we consider the proposal inadequate and expect therefore a revision the the financial perspectives
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes we speak on a budget with approximately billion euro the implementation and billion euro the payments according the position the the parliament the to what the are we far below the upper the the own resources
i i is the important that we the budget use to the european union the budgetary and administrative level to consolidate
the should we our obligations course not from the view lose and if i am on obligations i i the also on the common agricultural the basis this the the by the decisions on agenda
i like here also very clear make that those the up from want to not aware that there the currently in the agriculture and the the rural  and breed place they would a debate can aggravate that there end to lead that the says as now is the 
brussels the commission is although responsible for the external trade for the competition the the area the the agricultural but already the rest must back we can not allow that our structures still further the on in be been
the different areas must we our resort take to resources from the reserve
that do we not for us pleasure that do we because we pressure want exercise and the priorities the the parliament the sensible way used want see
we would this resources from the reserve not need have if the committee in the future as also the international level happening the opportunity would to thanks a amendment the the  the the financial rules during the current year resources to block and to freeze if this necessary if are and if not sufficient account the taken with the positions the the parliament
i like very clear say that we us what category the want the the the commitments political and international obligations and the new challenges accept
that means for us however necessarily also that the commission and that will we also demands the november a detailed clear and clear report tabled on the the the affairs the the to now to commitments obligations and on the amount the the arrears payments
i recommend the commission the very the to ensure for a sound report than need we in the next years least not more the this problem back to to
as this figures not available are will the liberalise the the general  the approximately million euro the problems with
as this issue not fully is clarify and discussed refuse i those even also but to speak on a revision the the financial perspectives
we must course also the council the the sense to that he responsible is for the lack implementation the many external programme programmes late i clear to that we prepared are the on the the now available estimate the programme for the balkans to finance
the means however nor that this only the financial perspectives must be review this have we a very sound financial planning on several years need
i like still a last issue mention because this with the gave the the
extent the our experience from the past want we help the the creation the a new administrative culture the european level the a new culture the responsibility and aware
we have agreed with new posts in the year
we want the commission however the clear make that we before we all prepared are to speak on the second tranche a precise discussion and analysis need have on the way which the the community right can simplify without to do the the content the the acquis community the the way can the posts saving the both community if national level
we expect the the commission a same precise analysis on the way which the european administration the with the view the the enlargement must develop
to to prevent that we in the next year again the this problems must back must we this now already if demand to the to than the the commission a clear signal for the homework that they in the during the the next half year must do
president i am not as the mr bourlanges frustrated by this procedure but i must say the is the one the the  the i in years in the committee i seen
while there so problems the the background are is there here in this house fact but relatively little to the and that is perhaps unfortunately
the is perhaps a type  a year which we are between the one events the the last year and perhaps the one events the the next year
but in any case there is not as even many happened
there is course one very important thing that is a beginning that we made have with category four with the approach of but the is however still not at clear or we there now in managed are to that the to solve also because the council fact completely not wishes that to think
the is always from the berlin berlin berlin but if we to the minister listened have than that that the berlin redeemed is
the is not berlin the is berlin redeemed and as duplication redeemed berlin
the is fact at not berlin president
than mrs dührkop has there also already the out is there the fact that there the problems are with the appropriations
this has the minister simply not precisely about
we have in the social fund problems had with appropriations
we must not forget president that we now still in the stages are and that the  as is that a  later is action
we have also still the benefit the the agricultural because the euro as low is what always to certain benefits the
than can the therefore mean that we next year or the year this suddenly a tremendous need to the appropriations
and than must i the council still see than must i still see or he than still prepared is the necessary appropriations the available to to and than will they the something otherwise going why the not can
that think i therefore the dangerous
the system is that from that the appropriations simply follow what there approximately spent must be but the council makes there a separately  the and that  danger berlin from to one despite the fact that the actually with berlin are is
president still one thing i think the that the committee ensure must careful not to many and not to horizontal in to intervene in the proposals the the specialist
i think that this year a little from the hand got and i think that we us this still serious on must consider
mr the president there will in first reading on the budget be certainly
that means that we still but the the beginning the the budgetary are
that is important because the level the today a already to large increase the the budget means
if the increase the adopted must all eu account the with a increase the the costs in their budget
for sweden will the increase approximately million euro sums
i believe that the most member the increase accept the condition that the money the the right way the used
in the sense i i my doubts the this proposal
the is there than also the the the time good to use
that applies course for the committee and the european parliament the the necessary priorities must determine but more still for the ministers the a clear answer must give
the increase is incomprehensible high in category the agricultural the the union this has the ministers the last floor
the is to a increase the the expenditure the more than cent
to my opinion must the committee the end november unequivocally the initiative take to category less quickly to let increase
if they that does is they also credible when they the parliament later asking to corresponding measures to take
priorities are important the the up the a budget
few the the priorities are the enlargement the the union what the the summit the berlin was certainly and the to to our obligations the serbia after to to
if we the necessary  make can we the two historic tasks to a good end to
to my opinion can this within the framework the the calculated that by the european parliament the supported
mr the president mrs the commissioner best mr programmes in the first place would i the congratulate the all rapporteurs want support
the is very rightly that there the out the the efforts the the general rapporteur mrs haug has made to a sensible consensus to the to to the hope not will be 
i would however with particularly want like the the operational budget the the ecsc the must be given in the light the the this at now the treaty the are end the
the final the the budget is modest and correctly
what the the strategy the the general budget address our group the the the quality the the expenditure and the a effective management and that applies also for the 
i accept the problems and endorse the criteria the the rapporteur mrs rühle afternoon has mentioned in the with the jrcs and the social aid
the important is however also the adequate use the the granted resources to stress
thanks the research and the technological development generating a sector if the achieve and steel not longer only recipes but brings he now also  with a added gentlemen the the market
therefore is the vital important that the  programmes in this sector be supported and the resources ensure be increased far with the instruments the the ecsc but also in the future if the instruments there not more are
hand is the the important for the upon the the thousands workers and compatible with the rate broad amount that there the held the the level the in this year laid aid for the social postal for the coal
the operational budget the the ecsc for the year those not substantial the the the line the the last years is were
there is than also again there the same shortcomings
a look the the included amount from the  commitments is already sufficient
with the end the the treaty in the prospect is that still not as serious but the would the worrying are if in the legal the the period next the the ecsc the possibility remains there to such habits continue to to
therefore are we particularly vigilant with the view the the proposal for a decision on the financial consequences the the end the the treaty
the commission will must look or there a transparent mechanism in the life can be established so the european financial institutions to course time the remaining assets the the ecsc the gentlemen can importance and as protected are against the possibly in failed continue the  and so there by means the a system the public competition a maximum profitability can be success
mr the president a the the large privileges the members is that they on the budget should talk
if former member the the british house does the i pleased that we this here today the opportunity have
a old hitting reads not tax without representation
if we however to the  look the this all another in the the further attention deserve
we to us involved the that the  elements the waste and inefficiency contains
i know that the commission development this carefully to look as the committee
earlier is already about on the hurricane mitch and on financial support the the population the the affected islets
the people this have never money the us been because we our before not good for other had
but my most comment the the acp
two weeks ago was the joint parliamentary sitting for the  meet
the is not longer a joint sitting but a joint parliamentary sitting
and that brings i back the my previous comment on tax and representation
now to members from different countries two time per year if members meet to to speak on development
but when you to this joint sitting look see you that this not provision task has the regard the the budget
the is the a parliamentary sitting but they has not budget to to control because the accommodates the we use for the acp by the member the controlled
i can i from my  not only debate on the accommodates remind and i doubt or there in only member on the discussed
who the the elected representatives debated there fact on the accommodates
i suspect no
the commission  and has
we have a parliamentary sitting the not budget has
this deserves further attention
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i like couple the what the mr deva just said
that is indeed a the the real scandals the european level the member refuse still still to billions euro under the competence the the european parliament and the  the this parliament to to
only the member and the council are here responsible for this applies also mrs rühle for the redgreen government the germany the used other language has about and now in any case not prepared is this step to to
the second were few weeks ago still reserved made
the early the the what there would done if there the in serbia indeed something would thought the early the the or the european union the in the would are to action since as was said the not with the as strong promised money on the bridge was
i i has the european union in the last days more than the united states demonstrated that they the certainly in the is appropriate the a such situation to respond
this parliament has this week also the before the the council important decisions taken this were need to to achieve what doris pack already mentioned for christmas this year must the first money the ground arrive so the people this will see that the the effort worth is the for the democracy in to to
that brings i the my third comment what the us now to wait
i i a concern i see that we the common foreign and security still sat make still further do recover we have now even already a mr cfsp that we also the european security and defence still further build and this specific measures take but same gradually the still less money to spend for measures the foreign policy
here is already about on a possible  the latin america asia and africa but especially latin america
therefore more talk on foreign policy and less solidarity both that is the den duration improvement this must we something change
this must not the expense the the other areas in the world to
therefore must commissioner patten clear make that he the plan is to ensure for a more spending the the money that must the commission in the year hard make
i like you ask the provisional decisions the the committee on the proposals the the parliamentary committees with a critical view to look in my case is the the to the environment and health
as is there example not few justify more for the continuation the the support the the tobacco in the european union
this special cultivation the as you know annual with a billion euro supported although the european tobacco in the union at not market more take and must be exported
this is the that we precisely the this at work the a new directive for products the objective of is the consumers to point the the harmful consequences the smoking for the health
the like the  in the union considerably reduce
therefore is the schizophrenic same the tobacco to want continue support
we must this support gradually the reduction the condition this is although that the tobacco structural support the given for the conversion to other 
same must with the budget appropriations the available be the for the fund for research and information so research can be done to alternative  for the current 
i i are this the most sensible measures the we currently for the  can take
i am not  i know that this currently not majority is to find but i like the the mr programmes questions in as large possible numbers for this package to vote than give we last a signal that we forward want with this issue
a another important point is the european agency for  in london
the budget this must absolutely be increased we have this agency because responsible with a new task
this agency must the development the medicines for rare diseases the socalled  drugs promote
today is this already the a and another on said
ourselves have a legislation this the started let are and this only in april the this year in force let act
therefore must we now consistent are and ensure ensure that our decisions hard be made and the appropriations for this agency be increased
the is other not in us important agencies to promote the for us these work do the not clear output have
that applies according us for the european agency in copenhagen
also the committee has that recognised
the is there not to that we regular the resources for the agencies increase we must rather good work promote
i request you than also to accordingly to vote
mr the president mrs the commissioner i am just back from the spanish  that is the gibraltar not far the morocco
i i this the  in the port see  that picture spoke themselves because the us very drastically  that the fishermen forced are to 
perhaps was and is the also the a picture the our own procuring
the fishermen are without work they are ways and disappointed
already eleven months long is there not agreement more with morocco
the mr fischler negotiating although hard but to now to without result
the any  region andalusia is userfriendly boats are in the port
the fisheries is userfriendly who the for alternative employment in the eu
the what lines can we money find for the possible restructuring
the new financial agreement provides not in resources this
i i noticed that the still  the towards the politicians in the eu
precisely therefore is a serious sound and optimism budget needed
needs margin and flexibility must the other be between that is the new lesson the we must learn
the fisheries form regular the the even end
very often is this commission the wrongly the target the attacks to financial and political reasons
we are open for justified criticism also if this from our own spectrum is
we want however also that the to us listening
what the employment the speak we only already on direct jobs which not alternative there we are however on the considerable imports
the market looking although still more its own private roads but that expels us not the our social and economic obligations
therefore have we the are least sufficient appropriations need for the agreement the condition course that this a presented assessment limitations
therefore to we agreement with the distribution and classification the the appropriations if compulsory expenditure without reserve and if emptyhanded title with reserve
the reserve will than be used if we new agreements want the that will therefore agreements are the only from next year the application will are
i am that that the for the measures for the fishing for very the fishing will vote only the the way can we according i expression give the our common political like
mr the president i like like the this opportunity use make to my contribution to make the the debate the evening
the debate is probably the most parliamentary debate in a time the twelve months
the is quite ridiculous that we must fight to the positions to the to can to the the region programmes the we represent
those the on the future the this parliament to would there good the do to aware that they a debate the one day need have and not a debate the two days on the budget in the future
i i there than also not effort that to the to have on the effects the the european union in my region view
i like very clear to that the influence the the european union the northern extremely directly and positive is
the is good for northern
northern has there benefit the
the peace and programme that by three members the this parliament together with the former president the the commission jacques delors the concert is the has now very positive developments the the the in northern
the cooperation are a large success become in the region
they are innovative and to new ideas
also is there area the for a whole new practical approach
i like also like stress that northern since briefly a new regional government has with if prime the leader the my party david 
there the work the a new future
you must understand that northern the last thirty year been has ago under the terrorism
we try new ways to seek to forward to to
we try ways to find to with other together to work
we try ways to find to other to help
the would project are if we the flexibility were to that everything achieve to jobs to create to employment to create to the inhabitants the northern again the the work to help and also to us again with real political are to the in place the  to seek to with other the opinion to differences
that is the objective
that is something to us all on to verheugen
i like in the first place the parliament and in the second place the committee thank for the persistent support and the unceasing understanding for my region
i welcome that very
thank you mr nicholson

the the way can the this right specific and appropriate guarantees offer during the months work have we tried and we believe the to are managed with the aid the the commission a detailed regulations the to to which meet can be has the the ensure the are same both in the council if in the parliamentary committees in the commission the committee and the made committees
thanks the benevolent attitude the regard the all involved institutions could a exemplary cooperation place i hope the much i that this cooperation us in the will to during the first reading to agreement to to
in the many compromise have the in the council detailed solutions in broad extent their up found in the solutions was already account taken with the during the parliamentary debate to the take proposals
on this appointment must the parliament and the council agreement see to achieve the must they choose from a series names the people the after a allow research by the commission be operate
your rapporteur must however with the unanimous support the the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens insist the a number amendments i mention example the amendments which a original solution the proposed for the long discussed issue the the scope the the regulation
the application the the regulation remains limited to the community atmosphere but there is the there the a certain protection against activities the institutions the not under the first pillar the in the by us proposed solution the a appeal done the the rules on the protection the privacy the accordance article the the treaty the up the the community the application are the the right the access to documents
in unlike to article the article also mentioned in the treaty on the union
further have we for in cooperation with the national  and the authorities the the third pillar the want we to to coordination and a gradual harmonisation the very the legislation in this delicate sector
we have also to example the the for the ombudsman current system a independent line set for the supervising the data order are independence better to can guarantee
i am that that the parliament and the council the results the our efforts fully will support
than will the the first time are that we the the codecision already during the first reading to agreement are has and the on a extremely complex and technical an difficult legislation if this the the application will are the a very sensitive sector the the protection the the individual freedoms
precisely because the text with so technical difficulties is failure have we proposed the vote on from to to to the next partsession than have we the time all versions still agree against the light to the
the are namely still not controlled as this in about and about is will we a good result have achieved thanks especially the competent conciliation the the presidency the the council the constructive contribute the the commission and the members the all groups the during their work demonstrated have given the large sensitivity for the common important and the rights the the citizens
i like than also in the public all thank the have contributed the the approval the this report in the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens
mr the president the protection the the personal integrity is a fundamental human
any day be there large quantities data registered example in the curtailing or the payments the internet
also within the eu is this the case
this proposal is a good basis for the protection the the personal integrity
the free movement the data requires a efficient fight the the crime and this is a efficient protection the the integrity necessary
according the proposal must the eu not only given on ethnic origin political conviction religion health or sexual use
data on criminal background and safety should only under strict conditions be processed
the data should only be used if this a justified the to is and if the people in issue of the the informed be the
i favour already long for a independent european control the the protection the the personal integrity without new bureaucratic structures
i think paciotti programmes proposal to a european supervising the to to very good the supervising must the rights the the individual the the institutions guarantee for the necessary control ensure and the institutions advise
time must we course the cooperation between the involved bodies the the member retain and enlargement
the is important that we a functional system to the to and the confidence the the people win
therefore is the protection the natural people also as essential
they makes part from the the new eu for the fundamental
in the future can we perhaps to the judge steps to the this level still better to be protected
we the the european values must defend in a country that sceptical the the the eu to this a additional argument for the union in hands a better protection the the personal integrity is because very important for the citizens the a modern society
and although this task not without effort was dealt like i mrs paciotti however congratulate with its excellent report
i hope the that the used model that the members has prevented to the large scale the the debate part to take not being is the how such questions in the future will be dealt
mrs paciotti is the managed to all institutions to unite
i like its therefore congratulate and hope that the parliament its report supports
mr the president our group is on the general satisfied with the result we are especially welcome that the application the the regulation for the whole community will apply
this rules will especially for the second and third pillar apply
we are especially welcome with the wealth the initiative and creativity the this work which
we thank the rapporteur this
we find the institutional solutions excellent
the is here because not to a collegiate body but to a supervising and a 
the is essential that the access to  not the limited how important the protection the data also is
the european ombudsman had there unfortunately enough the point that the commission the principle the the data has used if justify for its refusal also to parts what people have part the a sitting the to objective had the commission to influence
this is a example the the way which the principle can be abused that must not more done
i hope really that everyone presented that the provisions not the the way should be applied
we must also aware that the european ombudsman and the supervising  the other be
we must not surprised are look if they the and to openly in discussion to
the is very positive that their tasks not were united
for certain parts is the here to a modernisation the the old directive ec
in this the like i the commissioner the next questions when start the revision the the general directive on enhancing
the is because clear that the directive must be modernisation to to for in the needs the mr cederschiöld already has the
also the safety the data in networks must be examined
to finally like i there still the point that i if finnish citizens i can the that the european parliament the only institution and the only democratic elected body is that decisions the the commission on the secrecy the data in a third country can control
we know all the famous example
the european parliament is the only body that the control with the existing procedure the a democratic way can exercise
i understand that my own country the law the the protection the data will adapt which the democratic influence the the decision the the commission at associating
i am than also welcome that the dialogue with the commission as good is has and that there a procedure is developed the the privacy the the citizens protects
best mr programmes fifty year after the beginning the the european construction is the time that the union last a supervisory authority elsewhere to the citizens to protect against the abuse that can the now there still more computer with data be built
by the exponential growth the the tasks and powers the the union as by the strong increase the the number community bodies is the essential that the rights the the citizens exactly and legal be defined with particularly what the the information between institutions and bodies the the union
the basis the article the the treaty has the council the parliament in the framework the a codecision a regulation proposed
that article the that the protection the data in the union the january monopoly would must are
almost two year later have we still not results success and therefore should we also not bogged are in a long codecision which the implementation the this measure still more behind would up
mrs paciotti has that help prevent and i think really that they if our rapporteur really excellent work has made
let we directly with the door in house the
the main mentioned between the parliament and the council the the with the competence the the future supervisory authority
must they the to to the first pillar to know the purely community institutions and legal standards or must they the application are the all provisions the under  the to know the second and the third pillar as schengen and europol
for us is the clear the risk programmes the the protection the the private the the citizens and the risk the abuse the their data are many greater in the third pillar the today the day little or not subject is the parliamentary or legal control than in the first pillar the under the competence the the court the justice is
the would i i clear the unipolar testify the body only for the community area the to up while the main problems also in the institutions the the third pillar arise and will arise
the is example know that there in the  more than ten million quantities on almost half million citizens are through that the powers the europol still further be extended that europol information the the different police the the fifteen member centralisation and that everything only but under the monitoring the a authority the or the powers or the resources has been to the other task really to can role
the report that we the to take reflect this ambition not
the competence that from the regulation resulting is limited to the first pillar that like say to article
the second and third pillar will not be covered by this regulation and therefore will there therefore confusion continue the expense the the basic fundamental the the citizens
apart the the limited reading the article was the however possible been article to take if supplementary legal for the enlargement the the competence the the regulation
mrs paciotti has that the tried by in article the the regulation a reference to that article the to take but the council has refused the possibility to into
many other points are worrying and must in the practice be where to there january on to can offer
our rapporteur is the aware aware the this problems and has its best done to not still agree two year behind the to are
we will its therefore despite everything support in the hope that the council and with particularly the commission the weak points the the text not the the socalled will take in a attempt to the text from to one
also must they as quickly possible a instruments try the to to to the data in the second and third pillar to protect
the is in any case dangerous that bodies as europol or the  the without parliamentary or legal control should develop
mr the president also i like the rapporteur congratulate with its report
indeed the the problems the the protection the data especially the with the concentration and exceptions the is here with particularly to the exceptions the the second and third pillar but also to the in the directives mentioned exceptions for  and activities in the with the national safety
as mrs boumedienethiery am i the opinion that this exceptions the the source the concerns are under the citizens on the protection the their privacy
i i has the rapporteur its effort best done to least the possibility to cooperation as many possible from to extend especially with the view the the future and to the the way probably also influence from to can exercise the this issue therefore give we our full support the this report
this said having wanted i now the commissioner present is clear make that the the not only pressure must make on the protection the the citizens against the new technology the must also look how the the technology can use to the citizens more participation to offer and are contacts with the european institutions to facilitate
we must not only the directives on the privacy in the framework the the community institutions apply but also other directives as the directive for the digital signature than can the citizens also the federal way petitions submit a appeal do the the ombudsman participate the comparative into and the up to the court the justice
that would a strengthening are the both the protection the the citizens what very important is if are  with the institutions
this is although not the the item in the report the mrs paciotti but i wanted the the the opportunity use make to here the attention the to draw
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues i congratulate mrs paciotti with the excellent work that they has done also wish i here to emphasise that we progress with this matter must make and the endorse i the objective to this dossier in first reading the to conclude
in the modern society which we life be daily enormous quantities data gathered through and processed
therefore have the european citizens the fully right to the the to questions or their personal privacy the sufficient the protected and a balanced solution to expect the their rights and freedoms obligation and guarantee
not the the two in the european union existing directives to protection against illegally use the data are however the application the the community institutions
therefore must the in amsterdam made agreements urgent in the practice be the
we have need the a regulation the the natural people legal enforceable rights much the obligations out the them the responsible are for the processing the data within the community institutions and bodies and provides in the up the a independent supervisory that the responsible with the monitoring the the processing the data by community institutions and bodies
there must almost be made with the up the this supervisory the european body for data
the is also important that one only secretariat the up to a uniform processing the the the control subject cases to guarantee
the commission like there in the first place the remind that we the citizens have promised ensure to ensure that the data the by the institutions be processed protected be
we have almost two year behind behind the the date the is down in article the the treaty to up the the european community therefore must there urgent a agreement found be on this dossier
under impetus the the presidency is the council the managed the difficulties to overcome the by some delegations were raised so the proposal for a regulation probably unanimously by the council can be adopted
the european parliament has many leaf the the day the to in the first reading a decision to can take and i like like my appreciation and thank express towards your rapporteur mrs paciotti the supported by the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens its forces not has spared to this agreement closer to to
mrs paciotti has the work the the council if point taken and has there also for taken that there a for all three the institutions acceptable solution found could be on the scope the the regulation the has they largely the way budget for a agreement in first reading
the commission has the its on also its role if degrees and  between the council and the parliament fulfilled
also they is determined the adopt the this important instrument for the protection the the data the the citizens not to delay
although the commission the opinion is that the reached result from its position not whole satisfactory is has they decided the text on to take the is resulting from the discussions in the council and in the parliament and in the paciotti the reflect the commission will therefore all other changes the its originally proposal reject
more specific the the commission on the amendments in the paciotti the next position in
in the amendments to and with to and with to and with and to and with the the text the council again arrested for the points which the commission its approval can attach
they accept this amendments therefore
amendments and supersede the the the text the the council but there is this a political agreement closed between the rapporteur and the presidency the the council
since the commission decided has the adopt the the regulation in first reading the basis the this text not to among accept they this amendments
amendments and supersede the the the text the the council but there is this a political agreement closed between the rapporteur and the presidency the the council
the commission has decided the adopt the the regulation in first reading the basis the this text not to among by a statement in the minutes the to let take which its legal position protected the the the the the the regulation by the council
with the statement accept the commission that the scope the the regulation only limited the to the activities the the first pillar
in the statement the also stressed that the processing the data in the framework the the second and third pillar the clear legal rules subject must be
according the commission can this legislation be adopted the basis the article
they its the therefore the right for this legislative proposals in to must
they its the moreover also the right for the by its out processing the data in the framework the the second and third pillar to issues the the principles the this regulation until there rules are up the the the processing can be applied
what amendment the believes the commission that the wording that not compatible is with its initiative they rejected this amendment therefore
amendment is a correction the amendment and is in consultation with the commission and the presidency the the council tabled by the rapporteur mrs paciotti to the initiative the the commission to retain
the commission supports this amendment and i would mrs paciotti ensure want thank that they the has tabled
the european supervising will namely a role play in the compliance by the community institutions the the provisions the the data the the citizens protect
the clearly therefore themselves that are opinion on the legislative proposals the regard the the protection the data very valuable will are since the a important contribution will make the the legislative debate between the institutions
the clearly also themselves that the commission the the the the such legislative proposals the freedom must have the appropriate proposal to do the the at that they this suitable eight
amendment seems acceptable for the commission since its initiative with the  not again the question under is to are
the commission barrel this amendment therefore the if a obligation the supervising to consult after the adopt the its proposal
the text would the that point still the what precise can are perhaps can that the the linguistic revision done
the commission will how than also a statement with the thrust make the the the the the regulation in the council
order the agreement to respect that the commission with the council and the rapporteur closed has to the text in first reading adopted to to rejected the commission all other amendments the not part of the the by the parliamentary commission freedoms and rights the the citizens approved paciotti except amendment that amendment right
you thank commissioner bolkestein
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the outermost regions the the european union
the the item is the report on the mrs sudre behalf the commission regional policy transport and tourism on the report the the commission on the measures the implementation the article member the outermost regions the the european union com c cos
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes the the first place like i like the members the the commission regional policy transport and tourism thank the with their comments and amendment the report that i evening hour enriched have
our commission has on the current and future fate the the seven european region programmes the the most the the continent from are unanimously a balanced and constructive document approved which long is like
the azores the canary islands martinique accumulated madeira martinique and réunion forms a particularly whole which the treaty the amsterdam the unique nature has recognised by means the a innovative understanding outermost location
in the treaty the namely recognised that the outermost region programmes the in a difficult social and economic situation are the still the aggravated by a number special disability because the disability continue continue and other strengthen are they the development the this region programmes in high extent in the way
therefore must we the current rules as many possible apply and appropriate measures take to the specific problems the the involved region programmes the to solve if need make we use the derogations the are adapted the the situation the the region in issue without that this the  in risk is
the report that the european commission march on has published the honest said not answer the the questions the the national and regional authorities the the outermost region programmes
the commission clarification that they impossible the all questions a answer can give they limited the often to the give the guidelines to the current action continue to to and to strengthen and demand the possibility the problems the case to case to deal
in article member is especially a political like to expression the several times by the european council and today by us parliament is defended
the objective the my report is the european commission the the political like to remind so they not more as now the rise impression makes reluctant and indifferent to are
the internal group within the secretariat the the commission must therefore quickly more human to so all proposed decisions the general thrust the the treatment by the college the basis the article member be for the a detailed memorandum on the consequences
in my report the the commission asked a really multiannual programme for to prepare with a exactly timetable the must a as extended possible overview to the the measures the they like to take and must all necessary guarantees are there the regard the the resources to the measures be to the and the regard the the continuity the the action to to fighting against the sustainable disability
i like the misunderstanding from to way overcome that the commission not terrorised enough is to the full use to make the the by article member is opportunities and therefore i i for that there a extended  unequivocally and that there each year a report the up
in my report that a answer is the the commission is a number sectors the mentioned the under the competence the the union the and the i evening only just will mention
the commission recognises that the measures the the area the agriculture and fisheries adapted or fullyfledged must be
but the situation the the budget the the second revision the the  is extremely problematic what a heavy duped danger to draw the the content the the programme programmes and the the 
the commission has in its budget for example a scandalous reduction the the budget for  proposed what the the many farmers the the outermost region programmes has led to a wave the concerns the i here for you use
further must the coordination and the optimum use the all community instruments strengthened to be with particularly the the structural the state and the tax and 
like the new community strategy for the outermost region programmes succeed than must we us action up the the areas the in the global competition the strategic important are transport energy environment society research and also technological development
as will the social and economic progress in the hand be work thanks a high 
thanks the geographical location and the marine nature the this areas must the outermost region programmes the active borders the the european union can be
we must however urgent the consequences start to analyse the the partnership acpeu that last june in cotonou is signed as the other international trade to their impact the the outermost region programmes to assess and the decisions to defining for the outermost producers the faced be with additional competition the they impossible competitive
to the to the a subject that the the with our near future the enlargement is now a essential aspect the the european construction but from now must the consequences that urgent be assessed to to prevent that the to properly granted support the the outermost region programmes and the measures the resulting from the implementation the article member again the the again to to are
mr the president with its report on the outermost region programmes has the rapporteur mrs sudre good work done
behalf the commission legal affairs and internal market like i its thank for the way which they the essence and the specific text the our amendments and points in its report has adopted
from the point the the commission legal affairs and internal market would i want stress that a equal treatment actually only but can direction for elements the also really right are
the attempt to a completely uniform system the to to for this outermost region programmes the with thousands kilometres the the rest the the community territory the the continental core separate are and the divided are in small island region programmes what the from the view the capitalisation and transport in a particularly difficult position are makes the impossible the general competition for the region programmes to to apply
therefore draw i the attention the point the the report the mrs sudre which that the out that the aid automatically article member paragraph a would must be applied and the because the reason the the in this member mentioned differences the is in the objective equality to create within the prohibiting
only by a general  the favour the the outermost region programmes would the circumstances in this region programmes right can be drawn with the circumstances which the companies in the continental core situation
further like i the attention draw the the fact that there in the report the mrs sudre to same reasons the out the the need to the up the special regulations the the area the taxes and customs
the large distance the certain region programmes the the continental core and the in that they be against the the automatic application the the regulations the taxation and the customs the the rules the apply for the continental core
the the level the the transport example that in point the the item is would the application within a framework the free competition the the rules on aid for the system the ports and airports this region programmes can robbing the a essential public service as the what the granted by ports and airports in the outermost region programmes would this service never by a private company can be granted but always to the essential activities the the public services properly
the commission has us a communication do sent the fact a programme is a type was the what there to do the
we hope that the commission that was or that programme will out and we hope especially that the tremendous institution which the commission now has the internal group the contact with the outermost region programmes in the will the and the central authorities the the informed the the our specific needs and problems
i wish mrs sudre than also congratulate and with large interest follow we the way the the legislation the the proposals the the commission so the specific circumstances soon in the considerations will be involved under the certain in article member the the treaty the amsterdam
mr the president commissioner i i large admiration for the report the mrs sudre therefore what i now i say is certainly not criticism the the report or the its
from the report is however a problem to the that i the more note and that the the the between reports and opinions with particularly the the applying nature
as are there in this report only words fulfilled the the conclusions the the commission fisheries unanimously has 
the part the the report on fisheries is largely devoted the a amendment the the resolution the is tabled in the commission regional policy transport and tourism
the commission fisheries has not any against the paragraph the the
contrary in the paragraph to certain points  the the item than in the opinion
but the the other on to certain important points from the opinion not back in the final version the the resolution
given the important the fisheries in the outermost region programmes regret i this very
i understand that the by differences the insight not always possible will are to the positions the in the various committees to the to the one line to to
what i however ensure concern is that we currently not standardised method have to yes to to
therefore like i the president the the parliament questions the to the on possible improvements the this point i think example the discussions before there the voted or the the adapt the the order which the voted
if such improvements health are we the risk that we the benefits favour the the expertise the we have and that is not only adverse for us but also for those whose interests we must
meantime would i the council and the commission with particularly the regard the this report want questions to to look to both the conclusions the not in the resolution are included if the conclusions the that the are
mr the president for the european union is this debate simply a the the many debates the here held be
for the outermost region programmes is this the most debate that the european parliament on them would can the
what we here today say and which we tomorrow vote will headlines are in the seven outermost region programmes and the regional television will length like the what we here say and decisions
some outermost region programmes are for many europeans not more than a tourist destination the the card
the is best possible that also a number the our  the the way him against the outermost region programmes
in the view the those the here evening the floor to behalf the region programmes is that a particularly negative and course completely wrong picture
behind that picture behind that landscape and that exceptional climate is the social and economic reality find the a number region programmes that to the least developed the the union one with the highest unemployment with enormous structural problems the our development make
since more than ten year that the european commission view to have for our problems and our special situation
this is the first time that the plenary sitting the the european parliament debated on our region programmes after there in the treaty the amsterdam a new article on our region programmes was included
to the date and since there under the presidency the delors a internal group for the outermost region programmes in the life was established have we a long and fruitful way made and behalf the outermost europeans like i the president the this group sincerely thank
the document the the commission for the development the article member the the treaty is a good document and the excellent report that our rapporteur mrs sudre us today tabled is a progress in the holed
with this article and with the rules the will be set to the the implement to to have we the legal the we to the date have  and a good instrument for the development the our region programmes
mrs sudre has a balanced report know the to to which a large number the the amendments more than the were tabled the its original draft is adopted
in a the the amendments the proposed the policies the the financial instrument for the steer the the fisheries to development to to and to to apply
what i here today like stress commissioner barnier is that the given the full application the the community for the outermost region programmes essential is that the rules be between the the their situation so they the economic and the social cohesion between the people the this region programmes and the other european citizens not make but precisely promote
the outermost region programmes and the europeans the the continent benefit not in same extent the the internal market and the the rules for the regulate the the market
the natural restrictions the our island markets the the thousands kilometres distance are make the our companies difficult to competitive to work because problems the the level the transport communication prime and higher  costs
therefore is the for us as difficult to wealth to generate and employment to create
our unemployment properly to the highest the the whole union
the is than also matter a series measures to take the in the report the euroscepticism sudre to in detail are included
what us the must the measures further to more than the policies for regional development because our deficits and disability the structural and not the economic nature are
our distance to the continental core will always large continue and given the island nature the our region programmes will there always problems continue there our geographical location must than beautiful are but they is also the basis the the heavy circumstances which we situation
we questions not to subsidies
what we want are measures which we our region programmes to development can to
the outermost region programmes provide europe atlantic american and african dimensions the a enrichment forms the the cultural political and economic diversity where we all with right as proud the are
mr the president mr the commissioner mrs the rapporteur we debate today in our sitting on the outermost region programmes and the must to be said that that the result is the a long mature
although there if since the treaty the rome reference the made to the french overseas departments have we must wait to and to the introduction the programme programmes for specific the the outermost and island location concerted measures the famous  programmes before the european union last recognised that the permanent nature and the cohesion the the structural disability a special treatment the relation the the other region programmes the the community justify
eight year later was the treaty the amsterdam with are article member where we the on have the hope  that the words growth and employment agree the the whole european territory same importance would to
the was therefore long wait and the hope the our population laws is accordingly grown
i must therefore also admit that i somewhat disappointed was when i the communication the the commission read
best mr programmes this is not more the at to statements for the  the to to
we have quickly specific measures need a exactly timetable where we us also the the
we have real financial commitments need and not  which now removed is as in the budget
we have with particularly the insurance need that the measures the the long term are at because our disability the in article member be mentioned peripheral and island location low area may climate the disability will not quickly disappear
therefore am i welcome with the certainly and the ambition the commission regional policy transport and tourism the regard the the state taxes and the consequences the the enlargement the the day has the
the am i that the commission the amendments the i had tabled with a broad majority has approved
i like here further our rapporteur mrs sudre accomplished because its open and the consultation specific drafting which we a report have up which everyone are play has contributed and which our region programmes again really hope can to who
i am there namely the convinced that we our youth sight can offer the a way from the dramatic unemployment the its to despair very if we the succeed on to steps the a mainly financial strategy the certainly necessary but inadequate is the a  strategy the based is the a real recognition the our special circumstances
gentlemen mr mr the commissioner the outermost region programmes are already the symbol the the diversity and therefore the the wealth the european union
they can in the future a testbed be the the efficiency the its social model the best will illustrate
this is certainly get and courage need
i doubt there not the that the abilities will are back to find in the proposals the the commission the the council will present
mr the president mr the commissioner i like first mrs sudre congratulate with its very successful report
i put same the greeting on the the mr sánchez the like the this debate had part but because are disease still not present can are
he has always the important the this report stressed and has many work done the favour the this report
the european union must ensure ensure that also the outermost regions the the development part can take
the adapted measures the are intended to the outermost regions to support are justified because the negative circumstances in the regions
this is especially there the if the regions very on are the few or only a only means the there
the the negotiations with third countries and international organisations must also account be taken with the specific sensitivity the certain products from peripheral regions
the enlargement the the european union must there also not to lead that the regions outside the regional and structural the
our group supports also a enlargement the article member the the european treaty that the positive results the the  in peripheral regions 
the special position the and the exceptional support the peripheral regions are justified because the constantly negative circumstances this the differences must the however not try to reduce with permanent restrictions the the rules the the internal market or permanent privileges the the structural
to my opinion is the very important that the peripheral regions be integrated in the transeuropean traffic energy and networks
the is also need the opportunities to into for new the the peripheral regions specific measures the the policies and measures make the the european union currently the its territory apply
the economic development the the regions must example by different direct and indirect taxes be supported
mr the president mr the commissioner as mrs sudre in its good and detailed report to the brings the the outside doubt that the outermost region programmes five its there the a sustainable or longterm disability with the that to
the first have they itself members the the european union noncommunity countries to neighbours the second are they by the large distance to europe relatively criminally the third is their local market not as large the fourth are the geographical and weather a obstacle for the development the the  potential and the fifth are they economic on the a low number products
this lead necessarily to the conclusion that this objective disability the longer term with the view the the achieve the cohesion only compensated can be with support this must the necessary appropriations available be the the on the article member
with this article will the outermost region programmes perhaps in the are to escape the the permanent  which they the victims are during the budgetary
you mrs sudre demand if representative the the outermost region programmes rightly solidarity i like however also to your solidarity questions the the protecting the the interests the the objective areas with this office that not agreed must be with takeup as there is the disability in compared with the developed european region programmes
the enormously this is or we prepared are us to oppose against the attitude the the most groups as this today during the debate to expression was they have there because that agreed that the new policies not with fresh money but with the money the the still not fully detailed policies be financed
how closer we in the near the the enlargement the the union to the east to how important this question the
i am that convinced that now already clear is that without a amendment the the financial perspectives this problem not can be resolved
let we simply do what a saying says i not from to tomorrow what you today still can speaking
mr the president mr the commissioner with this report the the european parliament a new impetus the the policy for the outermost regions as intended in article member the the treaty
this the a answer is the the swinging the the commission and the often contradictory actions the they the last time the this area has taken
the is the intention that all articles the the treaty be observed they must document for document in the practice be the and article member must this not exception forms
we have therefore reasons to on to the important the this position the the european parliament to emphasise and the balanced approach expertise and  the the rapporteur mrs euroscepticism sudre to prices a floor the praise also for the contribution the already those the its their cooperation have granted with particularly the other seven from a outermost region originating members
since the time urges will i i to the essential to
the is course important that the the development the policies derogations and specific measures the  the applied so equal situations the equal way and different situations the different way be tackled the is i i however least just important that the inhabitants the both my region if the other outermost areas a dignified life can lead
this must they access to have to production the a increase the the  through
this the economy the the outermost regions in article member the the treaty itself the defined if a economy the on is the one only or a limited number products must diversification a priority intention are same must better conditions be created for the production the products the answer the the opportunities and traditions the the involved region
there should in not case steps be taken to the few benefits the we the regard the the other areas enjoy destroying to do
the the azores the mainly milk produced
i can only but hope that the application the article member the the treaty a positive influence will have the the advantageous the what what up the our opportunities and traditions
mr the president this parliament and with particularly the commission regional policy transport and tourism has still worked for the drafting the specific policies and programmes for the outermost regions
the unanimous approval the the report the our mr euroscepticism sudre by the members the the commission shows the that the european parliament faith remains the a the are most obligations
with your if would i the rapporteur and the commission regional policy transport and tourism than also with this excellent report want congratulate
the force the the treaty the amsterdam by january on the legal and in ensure that the scope the this specific measures was extended
the agricultural is doubt a the the areas where the consequences the this approach the the most do against
thanks the partial lifting the a number principles the the cap and the application the specific programmes for the development the the agriculture has the the depopulation the  if the the the azores a stop can drain
also the living the the island rural are this considerably improve
the experience the the over ten year and the new challenges the the development the the common agricultural to wait are learn us that this programmes must be review to the survival the the involved regions in the framework the the new competition to guarantee
the treaty rules expressly that the economic dependence the a limited number products a the the situations is which the european institutions specific measures for the implementation the the community policy must the
the agriculture and the economy the the azores are whole on the the weighs a situation the in very the european union its unprecedented not know
therefore hope all  that the commission the cap in the light the the treaty in the light the the position the the parliament soon will adapt the the situation the the azores
mr the president mr the commissioner if article member not in the treaty the amsterdam was included would we here today this excellent report the mrs euroscepticism sudre not deal
i wish the rapporteur moreover the i to congratulate with the excellent work that they has done
the order provision plays a fundamental role with this article recognises the european union because the own nature the the outermost regions and its they their the right the a specific special treatment the on the this identity the radical from the the the the rest the the territory the the european union
since the force the the treaty the amsterdam is this recognition binding and has they a constitutional nature in unlike to the purely political gentlemen the down from the the the treaties annexed statements
there they the out that this right the identity not more than a result the the equality is under this principle the because also called that different situations the different way be dealt
reactionary and  interpretations the the equality the a equal treatment the different situations first i i the the hand
article member is to  reasons a essential instrument the first promotes the the equal treatment the the european citizens from the outermost regions
the second bears the the the the correct and full integration the the outermost regions in the european union and the dynamic the the large internal market
the third preparing the the outermost regions optimum for the the challenges the the globalisation and the enlargement the the european union which they particularly vulnerable are only therefore want we that article member the applied
the is certainly not in our intention a privileged status to acquire
mr the president mr the commissioner with article member have we clearly a qualitative leap forward made this must however by to to with a qualitative adaptation the the specific treatment the the european union the the outermost regions must their
the  programmes are in this respect inadequate
the mentioned qualitative progress must to expression to in the the and implementation by the european union the a broad and coherent strategy as moreover excellent in the report the euroscepticism sudre the suggested
the outermost regions and their inhabitants look are expected from to the measures the the european institutions the implementation the article member will the
mr the president in the first place like i the rapporteur mrs sudre congratulate
to my opinion has they a wonderful document work made while they also that to have on imaginative a great conscience and the ability to agreement and compromises to the to to order this sitting and the commission a document to can present that according i are usefulness and efficiency will know to proof
mr the commissioner i think that this issues you particularly familiar are and that you there also open for the this you itself from you from a region with a specific problem
there are three region programmes in europe which the citizens a number specific problems know and that are the  programmes the island region programmes and the outermost region programmes
the on citizens to the positive and axiom diversity the their region first and they demands that their right recognised the to the same opportunities to benefit the the other citizens the the continental region programmes is the
this is a special treatment requires the must will from the willingness to a number measures a sustainable nature to give
the is not the here on a whole series circumstances to debate and than to believe that the if that ideal  point once achieved is to the as to mention unnecessary would are become to still more measures to take in the treatment the this three region programmes and with particularly the the outermost region programmes which we today debate
we want that there the held the a treatment based the diversity
we want a area continue or several in this case that a special treatment requires
the european union and you mr the commissioner must the that aware to are that the treatment a sustainable nature deserves
that is the message the i wanted transfer also wish i mrs sudre again congratulate and all members the the different committees the who we the to thank have that we here today have on the before report
thank you mr the president and i like a any the you ladies and gentlemen members the the european parliament thank for your contribution the this debate despite the late at
i am the opinion that this debate the the effort important is for the whole european union apart the the important for all citizens the in our seven outermost region programmes live
mrs the minister euroscepticism sudre i would you want thank for the quality and the openness the your report
this document the according i and my team are with ideas and proposals the affects the the core the the problems and late not only point the concern the the outermost community impact
you has this far remote region programmes if the were here in strasbourg the the floor let to and that happening not as often this region programmes have course to camps with disability the the the with their peripheral location the distance joint with for the most a island location and also with other often negative economic and geographical circumstances the however also a gone can forms
i am and i namely the opinion you has the moreover itself said mrs euroscepticism sudre that this region programmes in the heart the the atlantic atlantic close the the american continent and in the heart the the indian atlantic the role the active border the their union can and want role
further i i the that the political line the the the basis the your report is objectively given in large extent with the the current approach the the commission
i will first our broad approach on the outermost region programmes explain and then would i like something say on the work that now by the commission the taken to specific form to give the this approach
what the approach the the commission the had mr fruteau the just on a long mature if i your words good i understand the the commission the the basis the the outermost approach and the the different programme programmes    which the approach the the could to
they was and the the always times by the parliament both in the legislative stage there there ladies and gentlemen members more than legislative acts for this region programmes if in the long  the ground
mr fernández martín the i thank for are contribution has very rightly the specific results mentioned the there as success are
and our rapporteur the last march has this the balance the drawn
but the parliament and the commission have the aware that we with a the developing community the community approach for this region programmes must strengthen
the the preparation the the previous intergovernmental conference have they therefore their full support given the the negotiations the have led i remind i the still very good because i time the french negotiator was for the treaty the amsterdam to the adopt the article member
with that article can we not everything do but the the us the in the us action to strengthen and i think that that need is from to extend and to improve
we should however not forget that this article member also the that the community cohesion and the unity the the internal market respect must be
and that means ladies and gentlemen members that we and i say the certainly we you and i a balance must find between the failure the the general rules and the adaptation the the policy the the specific needs the the outermost regions
we must therefore fact as mr marques the just said equality the opportunities achieve for all citizens but the the central the between the two conditions the i just i us and the i still agree repeat adaptation for the region programmes the that need have and compliance the the common rules the the are in article
to that balance ladies and gentlemen must we the case to case seek
i like you like a example give
in your report mrs sudre the rightly stressed that us action the the long term at must are
mr ripoll has just also the important stressed the the sustainability and the continuity the the measures the we take precisely because also the disability structural are
how the the now the
some measures as the  are the indefinite duration
the many areas other as the the area the taxes or customs require the cohesion the the community and the unity the the internal market that there a term the the although the  very long is with the prefer a interim assessment
ladies and gentlemen in us report the march the to my opinion a strategy outlined which the european union more can contribute to the sustainable development the this outermost region programmes and as article member specific the implement can to
the coherent broad strategy must the in our view possible make really the  to make where in your report mrs the minister to asked the
the strategy is based the three main support the traditional products agriculture and fisheries
that is the first point
support the the relaunch the modernisation and the  the the economic activities by a better coordinated and decided use the the community instruments which we have
that is the second 
and the finally strengthening the the cooperation with the countries the in political and geographical respect the this outermost region programmes the are
that is the third point
and the combination the notable between this main the cohesion the this broad strategy must ensure ensure that we really forward to
mrs euroscepticism sudre seemed the just quite concern from to let on what they a type reluctance or reserve the the commission mentioned
i would its want say and we know other good i am now something more than a year commissioner that i good understand i that you to to succeed and forward to to and you can the the my support count the necessary steps a for a must to
that report the march was a the the compulsory steps
i i honest said understand that the report although the not all immediately the said in each the the outermost regions however a relatively positive and constructive s has found
we had that report need
i had that report need in my college to with success the next steps to can plans
but what you said has mrs sudre barrel i the if a type signal to the inertia the the commission to support
to course time will we same effort must make to the council to support and also as such signal the to give the the council
how ladies and gentlemen members the the commission this approach the implement
on the whole taken can i say that the work to wish has
for the preparation the the necessary proposals working the commission course together with the member and the involved region programmes
that is a constructive approach and cooperation sometimes have we however must wait and in some cases wait we still still the the detailed applications or even the more information the necessary is to a position in to take and our own proposals for to prepare
in feira have we the balance drawn the the progress the the work and that will we the the european council the nice course again do
in the report the mrs sudre the a number the the dossiers mentioned and i like like specific say how far we are
the agricultural prepare we the amendment for the the regulations the the the  programmes based are
as by you policy the want we to to the community support for production and prime to improve
that follows continue from longterm consultation with the states and the involved region programmes
we work remind to the proposals in the during the this autumn in to can must
what the agriculture the would i like in the particularly a few words up to the two members the here a region represent the i i learn know and love the azores because this i i my first official visit if commissioner made
mr costa  and mr casaca you has a traditional sector in your region mentioned the weighs
i understand the special issue the the milk the the azores
i must however honest say that this real problem not the the this need at problems is and therefore not part part the the programme that last march by the commission presented is
the commission is the however aware the this problem for the azores and because i the the ground given i say i still agree that the milk namely a almost unique product is
the is however not possible the quotas to increase or the azores free to to the payment the the additional taxation for crossing the the quotas
your country portugal has the commission asked this issue to look with article member if blame
our services have that research in still not completed
that wanted i say on this hoc ad problem that you both rightly again the the item has the
the the area the the common fisheries that by mrs attwooll was mentioned be the main initiatives in the during the next year started but i like say that there the this at already hard on the consideration
the regard the the in the to the the  the the economy have we the different crucial areas progress made
the commission has last july a important available was the regard the the amendment the the guidelines for state for regional purposes which aid to the costs arising from the outermost location to compensate now are allowed
that is a important and positive point although the on measures  and not in the time limited are
the the as seems i meet has the a request that often by the region programmes done the
the structural if commissioner the through the regional policy a large part the the funds under are stability has like i this like something on say
they play a essential role
the amount that for objective the the outermost region programmes is granted is you know the ladies and gentlemen for the new period eight billion  million euro
the relation the the previous period is that a increase the and honest said mr fruteau you the as such ardent call was to specific measures here is there a
i know that the not the only is the you about and the you need has but here has you a measure which we moreover responsibility guilty are the the european parliament and the everyone the the development the the region programmes the i is
increase eight billion euro that money and that is not easy task will we good and effective must use the favour and the serving the the people the local projects the citizens the economic social and human development the local democracy the the use must there account taken be with the new regulation on the structural what like say that we aimed and transparency must commissions and ensure must ensure that there a really partnership is with already those the part can have the a good management that course the deadlines respects
the rule for the deadlines the since the general regulation the after berlin very strict is is here course the application just if all
mr markov the the scattered the this figures see the honest said clear that we far from are the the fall the you just was but i i good understand that you the had on the future prospect for the enlargement i will this moments something on say and that you the not only had on the outermost regions but also on the objective region programmes
honest said is there currently and the next seven year but there the a fall
over the that considerable but necessary amount that justified the by the the the economic development and by the problems the the the with the unemployment in this region programmes to still agree the appropriations the the four community initiatives urban leader interreg and equal
this considerably sums ladies and gentlemen give not only expression i say the still agree because i the believe the the justified solidarity with this region programmes but also the the recognition the the key the they can and must play if  posts if i take your own term on mrs the minister the active borders the the union in the region programmes where they the are
the next days will i the opportunity have behalf the commission different regional programme programmes to sign the final approved are or that in the next days will be the any  for réunion through the written procedures the almost are completed the only programming the the three other overseas french departments martinique martinique and accumulated and the any  for madeira and the azores are you know the the july signed
rest still the any  for the canary islands that the in the decisions is
that what the the specific implementation the the programming the the regional policy and the considerable resources the agree involved are
ladies and gentlemen members the commission preparing further initiatives for to some provisions the the structural to change with if objective the the for the outermost region programmes still more to make by the kind the community support for economic operators to facilitate
i know that there the this initiatives was waited you has that reiterated by the fear from to speak that the commission reluctant was
there is not few reserve and not few reluctance
believe you i that i the my place with my mr programmes extremely constructive and honest to work i
the is not always simple specific progress to make the the initiatives the you expect
i had the  the march need and while i  and i  now quickly must i also assured are the real legal security
that is not for the hand else or ocean point even not the the interpretation the article member
apart the the initiatives the we in the next weeks will foster will this  moreover be see in the second outlining that as you asked has the consequences the the enlargement the the regional inequalities will evaluate
that report that i next spring itself will to present will the point forms the a large debate on the future regional policy on the future cohesion for the period
i hope that the in that debate particularly many attention remains pay the the development the the outermost regions
i am closely involved the the support and the support the the this region programmes given can be and i understand therefore ladies and gentlemen the concerns on the challenge the the enlargement the here and this live in your region programmes just if in the objective region programmes the i regular visit
mr pojarno you has the concerns just itself the there the when you the floor was behalf the mr  and us pointed the are work and involvement i would you want questions him  to to wish given the health which he currently to camps has
the mr markov has this issue also the there the
we must not fear have for the enlargement
on the whole taken is the a challenge the we the must to in the important the the union the its stability for the european continent the the peace the the democracy and even the the good force and the new opportunities the the internal market
course can the enlargement not just and the a arbitrary at done
this are rules for this work we the we prepare us the for but ladies and gentlemen members the is not as that because very poor eastern region programmes from to the union to should act and you know very good that they very very poor are the poor region programmes in west or southern or the outermost region programmes by the enlargement  not difficulties more know
in the region programmes there there we know the structural difficulties and therefore am i objectively the opinion that they given their real development sustainable support from the regional policy and special measures need have
ladies and gentlemen members as with particularly mr medina ortega the this issue has stressed know be there also different tax and  dealt example the dossiers the the canary islands the azores and madeira into
also would i the system the france for the overseas region programmes the overseas departments want mention
i can you assure that the commission many attention the the issues will turn
the already this areas again expect i that there quickly a number initiatives taken can be and that we the initiatives during the meeting in nice the the council can present
this does moreover mrs euroscepticism sudre with the wish the the president the the french republic the presidentinoffice president the the european council and the prime the france recently 
also other issues to many attention the the commission
i think mr medina ortega the a point that you has raised namely the transport a point that i already since long time interested further think i the energy renewable energy selfsufficiency the energy and access to the different community programme programmes
but i like here with particularly a point mention that particularly important is for the future the this region programmes
the is to the society
ladies and gentlemen the new technologies the society is not luxury the the richest region programmes the europe
contrary i think even that the new technologies the access to internet and all professions the there the that the a opportunity forms for the peripheral and outermost regions
therefore i i there personally for taken that a considerably part the the structural spent the the the society and the the access the farmers and the smes to the society
the is now the important that there in the framework the the only programming a large number projects the presented but addition this action the ground must we same indepth to give on the for each the this outermost region programmes specific needs and access to the society
what influence would the society can have the the development the your region programmes with particularly the the area the electronic trade administration   which i the the azores itself the very positive and specific results i given
the commission has towards a research started which we the results middle will have
the results will a role play in the  that joint with the national and regional authorities held will be
ladies and gentlemen the third  the the region programmes in their own geographical area
two affairs to us the with particularly the the heart
the first that the account the with their interests in the negotiations on the different trade the we the to the
as will we a study let out to the consequences the the implementation the the new agreement with the acp with the that can to for the outermost regions
further want we just if you the mutual cooperation between outermost region programmes encourage and between them and their geographical neighbours
i stress that the programme interreg where i responsible for am this the necessary resources provided since there in part b and i i this in the particularly the ensure really priority and therefore also many money the budget for this form the regional cooperation
the finally like i three important points from your report contain mrs sudre
the first asking you to us future action and asking you a multiannual programme
i like you simply the way the the commission explain
with us report the last march are as i just said i the main the a strategy down
we have there us to linked the the basis annual  programmes to present with timetable programmes which we our approach can adapt
we have the internal group for the outermost region programmes the various the you praise have dropped already task given the first programme for to prepare
the group has also the task and the i i in the a another point from your report permanent the different by the commission among initiatives to into that was a recommendation the you had done to that to to see that there on the whole acrosstheboard in all community policies account taken the with the legitimate interests the the outermost regions
and i will ensure ensure that the group month after month good are work does
the third point the the partnership  programmes
that partnership is a valuable part the the outermost approach
the is the application the the specific dossiers but must also ensure for a regular exchange the knowledge on all issues the the region programmes into
the november is there a  taken which many people have part
in the during the would there again a such meeting organised can be when we further are progress in the achieve the the in march presented programme
the conclude like i there i for apologise that i probably to long the substance was but this are important issues where i personally many gentlemen the importance i would like the  the us report the last march because and say that in our view the future the this region programmes largely the will be by the success the the strategy the we in this report have proposed but this success will also the large important are for the european union in its whole because they will as also its ability proof to with success a the the most complex challenges the to to which they the placed see
ladies and gentlemen members still a few make words
the basis the the report the march work i together with my mr programmes active the the initiatives the i i mentioned
i will that ensure that is my priority that there specific form the given the this initiatives and that the most of in nice can be presented
further will i there with you if you that you for fight to a dialogue to to on what there in europe the the stake the and the future and the place the the outermost region programmes make this part the from
as the intergovernmental conference is completed will i the next months each the this region programmes visits as i the the azores i done to you to meet to with you to work to social and political groups citizens and professional to meet and to also as i that regular i a dialogue the to to with the citizens the your region programmes
you thank mr barnier
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to at closed
approval the the minutes the the previous sitting
the minutes the the sitting the yesterday are distributed
not any
mr the president i like you questions my name the the attendance the yesterday to to add
i was the the rollcall votes present and can that also demonstrate but i had my name not the the list the
that will be done mrs been
mr the president this seems i a good at to a issue the the item to to the yesterday during the votes acting
you will the remind that there one vote was the vote on my report the was certainly with a majority the one voice
i like certainly the discussion on this subject not reopen
the presidency has this discussion closed declared and i accept that fully
after the decision however was taken said a large number members the this parliament that their aircraft not had work etc
i however when suddenly that there given the alarming number cases which all aircraft not work serious problems can the after the result the a vote know is made is there according the current rules because not few possibility more to the discussion on the on issue to reopen
the is than example not unthinkable that by a technical interference a large number vote in a the part the this parliament not the according the result the a such vote does than doubts questions on the effectiveness the our decisionmaking
there must for such situations perhaps facilities be affected in the rules
i hope that you with i the opinion you that this a important point the item is
i remind i the issue very good mr evans and we will this than also the the bureau present
course will i the president in knowledge to the what you now said you
mr the president let we apart the this point the item also think that the interpreters very kind against us are and the sense my machine working not sometimes not into if i working not
mr the president i like from under the article or the the rules a comment make on the sitting the the commission the today place
i like commissioner lamy ask with urgency a statement the to to in this parliament on the question why he parliamentary research to a article that know the if everything except arms trying to prevent
this has radical consequences for this parliament for the acp and for very europe
i say radical consequences because this parliament more democratic aware and responsibility like
this specific issue will not only a impact have the this parliament but the the most european member with particularly the the countries the products have if bananas a strong local production rice and sugar
to democratic aware and responsibility to guarantee must the mr lamy this statement today still make
he feels apparently nothing for a discussion on this issue with the parliament
the is however a very important issue
mr the president the mr evans is just back the the vote the morning he spoke with particularly on the vote during what a number amendments with one voice difference is adopted
according i does the parliament there good the the to the the the current rules because as a mr rightly has said the very often not the equipment is the the late variety but the members the forget to vote if the than later the vote can correct is there never a end the the procedure
that is the very clear has the the final on the report the the mr evans
if i had conscience that the later added votes and against more would roads than the vote before the report the the mr evans would i my group have asked against the evans to vote and than would the not are adopted
as see you in what for absurd situations we into if the possible the a vote to review i believe that we us better can the the the current rules
gentlemen mr programmes we will the matter how than also during the next meeting the the bureau the the item to
mr the president i like still just something explain with particularly the the to the the mr goebbels i had the not on individual members the report make the problems with their aircraft or something like
i concerned i ensure on the possibility the a general interference in a large number aircraft and on the rules the than doubts do the on the decisions the this parliament
i assure the mr goebbels also that i there absolutely not objection against i that affairs with a majority the one voice be certainly
in was the british labour with a majority the one voice voted and who i i never objection broad
the minutes be approved
food
the the item is the report a the the mr bowis behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the paper the the commission on food com c cos
mr the president to my pleased must i you today ask my report on the paper on food the to take
i like also your attention draw the the administrative amendments the are tabled the this report
sixteen of accepted i
the three the i not accept are the amendments and also submitted i amendment over and amendment over
as  already said the   was there  the human is what he eat
we are what we eat and unfortunately applies that also for i
i am clear what i eat
but now seriously if result the bad eat suffering some people the longterm diseases and die others even because the food that they eat their body has water
in the last decades have we a many scandals had oil contaminated wine  beef dioxins and sludge we have new words learnt as e   and 
there have the worrying accidents and scandals occurred the led have to fear panic and public into
our electorate all in europe expect the us that we them reassure and them say that the food that they eat safe is and the water that they drink fulfilled
they have not confidence more in the current  to the risks in the road the farmer to plates as that now often the mentioned to control and way to take
the truth is that you risks course never at can out
that is simply not within us scope
there will always risks continue or they now associated with animal and phytosanitary in the agriculture or with processing transport  storage or sale the food
and than are there still the risks the the people home in the table in the  and the risks the associated with the way which we the eat prepare
we can risk programmes although not at out but we can the action take to they the to encourage and the to tackle
this are new measures need
we must ensure for a framework for good information and good practices the the area the food feed phosphorus dioxins labelling additives new food etc
also is there a new body need the the confidence the the public and the respect the the member must restore
in my report to we for a european authority for food the to up this body must authoritative independent objectively be transparent and understandable are
they must the especially up the the safety and they must according scientific methods work
its task is risks to assess and then opinion from to to on the approach the the risks
the task the the commission is management and management
the task the the parliament is the control the and the surveillance the both
we have a early system
this system must be improve there can however only quickly responsibility on this system be made the the parliament if the under the authority the the commission remains the
the system must also close the  are set and terms method closely the the  with
the  must such be extended that the also animal includes
the director the the  will a central role play
he or they must be appointed by the commission the must however first the commission environment health and consumer and probably also other committees as the commission agriculture and rural on consult
there must annual a report be issued and the the parliament presented also must  be presented the the commission the parliament and the council
the administration must to there from people with experience the different areas as production processing retail  legislation etc the scientists must a  submit the the administration
the administration must then to ensure for a report in for the consumer comprehensible language also must the recommendations for management add and the report the the commission and us present
we must closely work with the national  and with international bodies
the work the the current five scientific committees and the scientific steering must the be together
the must a small were to with a professional staff that easy accessible is for the commission and the parliament already need we the location not today to discuss
i thank my colleagues the all parties and all member
i thank them for the constructive dialogue the we have had
i thank the commission and its staff
i thank the council and the french presidency for the feedback the they us have sent
i thank the secretariat the the parliament
we have here a proposal that can contribute to a better safety the us food this will the confidence the the public in the different countries the we here represent be restore
i hope that the parliament this proposal will support
applause
rapporteur for opinion the the commission agriculture and rural
es mr the president mr the commissioner you can the with this proposal the the commission difficult disagree are because the the full the good ideas and good intentions
he shows the clear the important the the a independent and expert authority the the responsible is to risks to assess but not to risks or crises to manage that are tasks the just if the presentation the legislative to the competence the the commission properly
mr the commissioner the parliament will the institution the a authority support we support also the to the guarantee the food favour legislative the you us has done
i like however the a fundamental point point even with the best possible legislation and a excellent authority the good scientific work does are we there still not
there can the again food arise time when that happening be the safety the the consumers the credibility the the institutions and the interests the the agriculture and the food threatened
if also the response the a such crisis deficiencies the the problem greater and the the from the hand
food is no the subordinate important the is here to the health and the stability the the 
i like the commission therefore questions what they think to do to the objectives the the paper to achieve
the is recently has that the crises not by a lack the scientific knowledge or by the lack the appropriate legislation are the
the problem was still caused because someone fraud killed and the could games because the controls 
that is example the case with the company that in the united kingdom  was the a from  obtained  that since was banned and with the thousand kg with bse contaminated beef the in a french  rightly are has
short mr the commissioner addition the authority must the competent services the the commission in cooperation with the member a uniform and effective system for the whole chain up also must the network the laboratories for  in the european union be strengthened and must this laboratories the coordinated way with the commission work
i assure you that this the best measure is because the a preventive measure is
president the proposal the the commission and the report the the mr bowis deserve our full support food must safe are food must also purely are
we must there certainly the are that the pathogen the  not in the chain into
we must that can confidence that  the tackled
but that confidence the time the time violated
the over s measures from the paper are therefore hard need
the up the the european authority is a important step in the good direction
its most task is scientific advice because also the discussion on food must purely are
around food play the emotions high the against globalisation against largescale production against genetic modification before local products before tradition and before diversity
the are often justified emotions but we must ensure ensure that they not considerations for protectionism be
we should the turnout the  food not deny but must precisely a proactive approach stand
the new food must quality have the ingredients must traceable are the label must fair information offer
consumers deserve a choice
the authority must both citizens if decisionmakers the objective information for
if rapporteur for opinion the the industry like i a few points stress
decisionmaking must clear and transparent are
duplication work and scientific research must prevent be therefore cooperation with national research and the common research
further is food a task for the whole foodstuffs the farmer to plates
essential is a good communication between consumers producers retail workers and announcement
attention for diversity in the central and small
strict demands and good control are essential but the must also the competition purely are
the finally favour the industry for a strategy for third countries and countries
food is a global task we should us not conclude for products from the united states or from developing
we must chapter to a common agenda
president i would like the rapporteur still just want thank for are constructive contribution and for are willingness the opinions the the other committees the i to take
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues the commission legal affairs and internal market has the paper on food carefully examined
our conclusions to line with the the the commission the committee
we are the also with the commission agree that food in the important the the citizens a particularly high priority must have
the commission legal affairs has therefore a significant number proposals done the also in this report the the mr bowis are included
because i but little time i like i i to two points to
in the first place there the not doubt that the legislation with the to the safety the food must be simplified
we expect therefore the the commission that they a proposal does for a legal framework that this if point can must
the relevant legislation must systematically in that framework be together so clear that that health the highest objective is
in the second place should the european citizens expect that their health the highest priority enjoys
they should also expect that they through the parliament a important voice in the  have when the protection the their health and the safety the feed and food in the affected is
the planned european authority can therefore only the the articles and the the treaty be based the must carefully be examined what powers this authority the
mr the president to to start would i the rapporteur the mr bowis you want congratulate and also commissioner byrne want say that we many appreciation have for the work that he with this paper has done and for the relations the he its with the parliament to the best possible legislation the the area the food to the to to
today deal we therefore a paper and the is important that we the few principles set
what the first the future european authority for food the must according i the tasks of very precise be defined the is the to the identification and assessment the risks
this must be coordinated with the existing national offices we must however also stress that the the competence the the political remains to the the alerted to draw and measures to take
here is a role play for the european commission the council and the european parliament
the is the second important that the authority in high extent independent is we must this independence guarantee
as is the the fundamental important that the  itself affairs before can make
the  must independent are the the member the european institutions and the foodstuffs
i i a amendment tabled on the prioritisation the risks
i i moreover the opportunity had this the mind to exchange with commissioner byrne
we are both to the conclusion has that the population in some cases risks see the there not are or purely the rumours based the is our task our responsibility to by the give the right information this rumours to refute and the confidence the the consumers to restore
when we be faced with a potential risk must the precautionary be applied
in case the real risks must with urgency precautions to be taken
to finally must the catchall the the european bureau for food limited continue to food
the must under not circumstances be extended to control or labelling
risk the foodstuffs must not confused be with the quality the products
how the also they the european parliament and the european commission are the the plan to the confidence the the consumers to restore
mr the president the is regular for that a mr in the parliament a the report the allocated which you its or him 
against the time that the report than the presented is that on this is with the mr bowis not the case
he has this debate the a excellent and particularly charming way to a good end the
he was constantly prepared to the the the compromises this has the commission twelve amendments can adopt the compromises contain and the the by almost all groups be behave
this week are we there still agree significant the reminded why we here all are and why this legislation the adopted namely by the report in my own country the the committee under leadership the lord  to the disaster i must the say the scandal with the bse
this disease has the in our herd can develop if result the negligence the were against those the this responsible are both officials if administration will tomorrow public the the world be public
we will not the proud are the our procedure the when
the procedures are now adapted and we have now our own service for 
that we now also in the european parliament a such body up if part the a whole series similar measures will our commitment and concern for the food in the european union doubt increase this is than a fortunately may the a  history
i like briefly the most amendments  the i the parliament and the commissioner the i  and the to i hope today will be adopted
the name is course very important and this has the mr bowis also accepted
we must this a authority mention because this term both in the english if in the most other languages a body logic that the competence and the ability has to in the  as now and than are own judgement to use in place the only but from to to what others want
a the the amendments the are adopted the the authority the competence to  the to to
on the question how far the competence the this authority with the to food must more and also in what they asked and substitute opinion must can produce the those the the in the first place deal with management there still not agreement this have we said that the issues which the to food is in any case also under the  and the  the this  must the
we have also said that the the processes the now in the are the the national  and the consumer in the member the the european union length must be consulted
this is important because we for this authority the full support need have the the public the all involved parties and in fact course the all member
that means that they must accept that the early system immediately must be improve and extended to animal
this week heard we that amendments beef in france the the enables the carrefours was happened this was again the another example that subject how difficult the is to those the the with the food not as closely take to tackle to to
the  must a administration to to with a balanced representation the people the expert are the the area the pertaining health and all possible areas the science and agriculture
the must people are for who we respect can have and the prepared are full opening the affairs to give on their interests
course will many the them links have had with the food or with another scientific institutions
that is understandable and also logical we must however to know how who and when and we must the information also can to
the  must annual report from to to the this parliament also must the director as he or they by the commission is appointed still available are to the environment the committee and this parliament text and explanation to give
if this everything is regulated rest us according i still only one thing namely calm wait to the commission with legislation is on other affairs the the area the the food    action the the area the eat and the amended legislation the need is for reexported babies and 
this affairs are hand banned with the activities the the authority
to finally will we also few new amendments support in any case the amendments to and with and to and with on amendment want we a free vote
we find some other amendments unnecessary in the general about are we however the opinion that the broad consensus the there in the parliament on this report still is been also to expression must to in the vote
mr the president the mr bowis has are work if rapporteur for this important and complex issue excellent carried
fact are there very many important and appear also contradictory objectives the achieved must be in this issue the food
the is under other to safety in this context would i want speak on the cheap food that families buy and that children and young people eat
the is here not only to the freedom the food and the relation to develop but also to the keep the the european heritage
a important part of is the work the the rich heritage and the rich traditions
therefore support i amendment
one issue is i i however not discussed namely the need the uniform framework by to do to with uniform and farreaching control
forget you not that the relation in are whole the the employer is in the european union
we must that ensure that the legislation in the whole union the same way the carried
otherwise to we the safety in risk and destabilise we the free competition the the internal market
late i the next again say see you that to that the rules the the south to the north good be observed
president mr the commissioner colleagues the   was there  the human is what he eat
that colleagues were indeed the first words the i in my  speech last year sellafield on the belgian dioxin
the are also the words which my mr bowis here are explanatory and speech start
the the immediately again that the mr bowis and myself together with the whole environment largely the same line are and i thank the mr bowis for the particularly constructive cooperation the over months
four comments like i make
the report makes rightly a distinction between one risk and hand management
against this background like i firstly say that the guarantee the food the or is with the by the authorities organise the strong controls and the controls are as strong if the weakest link
if the weakest link excessive is also the control if a frightfully in other
that means therefore that all purchase good must work and often the the to little attention spent the the purchase the the  must control in my country is that the pharmaceutical inspection
i regret than also that the service in my country not or hardly the involved the the future force the the federal agency for food
the experience from because that bad control the  and the bad control the the  the vets can lead to scandals
therefore attention this
the second the  the clear that the european  responsible is for the risk
we must there us good the aware are that this agency only a strong partner in the  will are when the in the during the the next years  will acquire
the  will there to not by laws not by legislation but the by integrity by academic ebusinesses by independence by accountability by transparency and by intelligible
i favour there than also for that the a balance the scientific opinions also still the  be published
science is because colleagues not static given but is still in movement and the debate on the six american hormonetreated has that sufficient proven
colleagues i am also welcome with the the farmer to plates and with the the  to 
i would even still further want to and favour for a the seeds to 
that means that the the look the food all products in look be taken and i refer this to paragraph the the resolution
the fourth rightly also stressed the parliament in paragraph that the rapid vigilant system extended must be to all aspects the the food with including the animal and rightly favour we than also for a rapid introduction the a positive list mr the commissioner
colleagues this is still but the beginning we have still a long way to to
we must aware that the consumer again confidence must to in the food and that is a fundamental human
i hope that we the next months and years the commission the very near will follow the the out the the paper
mr the president first give also we course support the all compromise and  which in the environment a agreement was achieved i hope that the amendments also here adopted will be
the you i however to a or two comments to make
the the discuss the this issue that namely how external and devoid the debate on the political unification the europe is
this seems you perhaps absurd but that is the not
without a strong political support will not few body in the are food to guarantee
here do the different issues for legislation implementation in the beginning way the respond the dangers measures  compared with imports and control the what the outside is
i question therefore who is this for ensure
the national authorities
the authorities the the involved member have precisely tried the crises the the to now to have occurred to conceal
must i here remind the the policy the the united kingdom in the with the mad
what organisation can for all european citizens control exercise research up and measures proposals i will you a small example give
i question i the what a body if the us here proposed had can do in the time the the mad in britain in the time the the dioxins in belgium in the time the the modified cotton and the of derivatives products as  in greece
i believe not many equal
if therefore this organisation not the status the the a  will they not many can safeguarding
than will they the are highest something like be if the agency that excellent  done but as the itself says the environment in europe not can improve
mr the president gentlemen colleagues in europe the regular large concerns caused by serious 
this crises as the bse and the dioxin are a matter social problem become and do the consumer are confidence lose in the food
that is very recent still agree has
the member have not  france has example a national bureau for food up
the european commission the today a proposal the table for the up the a european authority for food the to task has each risk for the health to into
a good scientific knowledge is doubt necessary to all risks for the chain the consider to  better to can assess
any initiative that a better knowledge the this risks possible makes is therefore welcome
is the however not as that we the problems order
as often the the commission regulations for to the negative consequences from to remain or to effects the a policy which they itself partially responsible is without also but in the slightest extent the main the that policy the discussion to to
as are the european demands on traceability certainly good measures they are however more to need become by the abolition the the controls the the borders the community borders
the same way seeks the european union the biodiversity and the ecosystems to protect with directives as the directive and the directive for wanted birds without however the excessive production the discussion to to although we very good know that this together with the urbanisation the main cause is the the distortion the the ecosystems
the is precisely this the  specific system that the risks for the food does increase the most draw of are the specialisation the the holdings the for the majority intensive advantages apply the need the the to apply the the prices the the american market and therefore to seek to costcutting solutions with particularly for the animal the sometimes endless  the different elements the the chain between farmer and plates
this are document for document watered for the health but the subsidised the evil to cure in place the the to prevent that is worrying
in this respect is there certainly a role play for the european authority for food with particularly the the area the scientific risk
we must there however the for ensure that the member responsible continue for management and for a reasonable and balanced application the the precautionary
this is a guarantee for efficiency
because who can better local controls out than the countries itself
who can better the distinction make between products the really dangerous are and products the also already are they not  part of the our different 
a absolutely zero there not and is also not desirable because  is not guarantee for food
who can finally the population better inform on the risks the linked are the certain products than the member
let we therefore the european authority for food only taxation with scientific tasks in cooperation with the national agencies
let we high demands to the the authority the the area the expertise and independence and questions that they recommendations does the the political authorities the responsible are for management
let we the authority however not initiative give to early warn or information the the public
we must also careful for a already to large uniformity between our habits
any country and france in the particularly is proud the are own food and gastronomic culture
this diversity rules also the wealth the europe and are high quality
let we this however on ensure
mr the president the is clear that there many enthusiasm there for the up the a european authority for the food as the rapporteur this body wishes to mention
just if in many other countries have we also in the united kingdom to central the just large support our own service up
this body is this year with its work started and many had there thereof expectations the
with the arrival the the ambitious proposals the the mr byrne seems the there however the that this national initiative will direction in the structures the the european union
this have we to thank the the mr bowis
in are report confirms he the subordinate role the the british service when he out that the the essential important is that the commission for coordination the between its various sections with including the national 
i am there between two only the very surprised on that he if conservative member the the european parliament obviously as easy on the fact  that again a british body the devoured and that while are party however still when the the the protests against further integration
nevertheless will the perhaps for some members if a surprise to if i say that i the idea the a paneuropean approach the the food as that to expression is in the  support
despite the fact that i by my british colleagues often if a small  am regarded i i there absolutely not effort that to to recognise that bacteria not borders know
they respect however not only not national borders but they the the course also not the the borders the the european union
despite the enthusiasm for again a new  must we if we a effective monitoring want further look than the fifteen member
that is a to limited vision a such programme must in a wider perspective be placed
therefore can we ourselves fortunately prices
we have namely already since the particularly effective surveillance the the world for the control the through the food  infections and  in europe this is together in the  in berlin
the is interesting to think that in unlike to the small  the as often behind this type projects are the those the the  originally the countries thought including the soviet since is the extended with all countries the the ago to the atlantic atlantic and the iceland to israel
the who its also not only europe but its sphere credit the from on our whole planet this is very important
when we the spread the the most by food  diseases the the this at europe hallmarks in card to see we that the most in fact for the first are detected in america
as is example the recent threat the coli o to there but one to mention probably the in america
the discovery the then to the usa then to canada hence to australia and japan before the disease outbreak in europe to to start in germany
if result of are many the the initiatives the since in europe are undertaken to the disease to combat the in other countries especially in the usa
risk must this start where the problem the leeway
if we therefore the need recognise the a crossborder body the the efforts the individual bodies must support and that i i indeed must a such body the not only deal with europe they must world work the the hand the information from the whole world
that is also exactly what the who already does they working fully integrated together with its local organisations
this would a  never can
that basis that the  also in the future sufficient resources and support will to seems the absolutely unnecessary to again a new body the to up late are a body with as limited scope if the fifteen member the the european union
the food is many to important to the another excuse for european integration to be
this shows the  on the the european union because the the perceived if a example the extreme paralyse
mr the president gentlemen colleagues the paper on food that many earlier had must before is a response the events if the bse and  the under the consumers large uncertainty and loss the confidence bring have the
two points to i in this the particularly the the heart
in the first place must there to our objective to can achieve absolutely a european network the crosssubsidisation to the be the
the powers the the future european authority and the the other institutions as the food and veterinary bureau in dublin should other however not there or with other clash
not only the commission but also the member must the legal possibility have a appeal the this authority to do
that is sense because the european authority than also independent the the commission can action which if necessary as quickly possible for efficient crisis can be taken
the conditions including a appeal the the authority can be done must however the such be formulated that efficient and quickly action the guaranteed
in the second place must there for all food a system be however which the ingredients the food to the their origin can be degrees
the this principle must the the planned revision the the community believes consistent be held
that is the only way to the  confidence the the consumers in the food back to win
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues the mr bowis has a excellent report up and i am the the many points with him agree
also with the view the the food the the to the date have occurred is the institution the a independent european authority the i to to welcome
food is for consumers the fundamental important because they healthy want eat and we must this ensure the maximum the the authority from from continue
they must risks assess and of report make and in cooperation with the five  a system the early warn apply further must the authority consumers as good possible inform on food and the safety of and as closely possible with scientific institutions and the supervisory in the member work to also the local control the the producer to the the consumer to can guarantee
to the confidence to restore and to strengthen must also in the legislation on land the fight the  medication environment and management with the food and the relevant provisions account be taken
for a reliable risk are comprehensive analyses and  need
the used due must be standardised and harmonised to to guarantee that the scientific results from very europe similar are
there is also a certain infrastructure need to research to food or special to  in animal to can do
in the institute for health and consumer the the common centre for research be now already quality and safeguards the food from very europe carried food be there under other the pollution controlled and there be  for agricultural and food done
there are extensive financial resources need to already this measures from to to
the is therefore sense the existing institutions the the european union the to involve and in to to they possibly from to extend and they to the this necessary financial resources to provide
i i topic a proposal done and i like you questions that to support
mr the president this is a complicated subject that the words quickly in down brings the fact that this in the plenary sitting only amendments are tabled shows that there within the commission excellent preparatory work is done and that there in good confidence is worked not only with the rapporteur but also between the groups between
i like the rapporteur this thank
the paper is in not case a response the the a or other crisis
the paper is the  the by the commission the a green that already years ago is published
we must there also the point with particularly the mr whitehead and mrs gebhardt have that already done that the paper many more than just a new regulation the the union is
the paper must there example to lead that there conditions be the which food really safe the
if we there not in succeed the early system to modernise and to let work than need we on many things not more after to think
if we there not in succeed the member in the responsibility for that system to let parts are we with a problem
we must feed the more legislation the more directives and more criteria issues
also what the health the the production the feed and the controls the must we many more are
without a new directive will we on many aspects the the food only but can possible
the commission has a very ambitious programme presented that approximately new proposals and amendments contains
from a few points presiding i the that the commission already are is and i think that the commission the the good way is
we have the course all in first body on this new authority
we are the in the commission agree become on what this new body the and what they not must do i add this however the to that food important is
we have now already scientific committees within the union the this ensure
if we the however not for other can to that in the member the compliance the the legislation also actually the ground the controlled if we there not in succeed the member compulsory to let report who what control and when and how often than can we in the european union the twenty new bodies up without that this any effect the the food has
that must we good for view the in such circumstances is a new body how the also the mentioned not more than  and a excuse
such new body will perhaps a certain member or city welcome make but further happening there nothing
output if no look the or to or everything remains the the old would than very applicable are
now are however health and controls the ground the routine
that is more the the member the than the the commission or the us because the member have to the date their homework not done
mr the president i am welcome and grateful today that is by both the commission the started is with the work for a better food if by the mr bowis and very the commission environment health and consumer
i am very welcome with the good cooperation the we have had and with the willingness the the the day is the to compromises to the for the to the to the a good report
now hope we the the support the the parliament and we hope that the council and the commission our proposals accept
the authority must together with the food and veterinary bureau other scientific bodies and national authorities a comprehensive system create
as mrs paulsen already said must all member and all companies including many multinationals the the the legislation the
if they that not do must there a  the eu to
therefore like i to amendment refer
when the food risk the the both the health the the human if the common market threatened
we must the eu therefore such change that the commission the possibility has to sanctions the to to the  just as they that now the the area the the competition has
the authority must proposals can do the the commission for suitable measures the this area
mr the president also i i the pleased to first the commission to prices for the paper food that i i a good proposal is also like i the mr bowis congratulate with the excellent way which he this proposal has improve and strengthened
also has he a document published with a specific resolution and a easy readable and  explanatory
the is not often for that we such texts under view to in the parliament
my group shares the position the the commission and the rapporteur on the distribution the the tasks for the independent authority
we are the opinion that its task must are the risks for the food to assess scientific opinion must the core are the its work
course must also the legislation be improve and very the chain the be together because the whole look the food characterised must be by caution and responsibility this must everyone the for working
also must the food so possible produced be according ecological principles
in fact have we a comprehensive strategy need for the its with food the the beginning to the end
the is to issues as gmos additives labelling etc
i hope that the commission here really the ensure
my group supports the most amendments
i think with particularly amendment important in this amendment the that consumer to opinion the asked
because in recital j the that the business and the pojarno to opinion must be asked am i the opinion that there a balance the this area must to
mr the president the existing  is by the  food and the discussion on the use the genetic the the production the food the the again to to are
optimum food and a  confidence to not together
there must therefore something news be word that think i also
i think however that the competence in last body the the member must continue based
the community is the the  and exporter the food
this sector the annual billion euro to and offers work the million people
i support all parties the the the strategy food for everyone work or they now a political administrative or other responsibility to
the developed countries can the this level the the contribution make by the a sustainable and diverse way food to produce
the paper is a political document the those the the responsibility for the production the food to
absolute safety is the this area not or hardly feasible
therefore are the precautions from the paper the real plans
also there there not that if a european taste
national details must not only be respected but even be promoted
the frenchcreoles also the only weak places the the paper on food
some questions continue outstanding what for relationship will the  example with the consumers build
how the the financing and the cooperation with member regulated
how is the with the liability
to now to pay namely the innocent the who
the commission will this questions the its further work still more must answer
mr the president we appreciate the work that mr bowis done has not only because he the issue the correct way in card brings but also because he important issues the the item the the still the answer wait
the the if a doubt over water that the proposed european authority a useful body will will both with the view the all  if the for the the prevention although the principle if operational indicator in this respect not enough is
aspects the still further the state must be the concern under more the need the a sound legislation definition the the understanding distort risk and specific protection for the diversity the the local food and productions also must the necessary attention take to the central and small and must the training the workers in the sector still better in the s the be
a another aspect that tackled must be is a consistently revision the the rules on labelling for both the large if retail so the consumer last the correct way the information on the traceability the products and components also can therefore in the case the risk programmes or crisis any responsibilities effectively be
also is rightly said that the authority not political capacity the and that they with particularly in case the alerts the commission and the member if  has
a and another will how than also only really will if the authority in force into
the legal status the powers the ways which in european the the dealt with other revitalise bodies whose tasks currently still partially doubling some with the the the to forms authority are also aspects the still further males must be
further the the important to see how the independence and transparency the the authority  can be one with its subordinate position the relation the the commission and the indefinite nature the the financial resources the its the part the hand with the composition the the council the administration and the fact that the authority the own isolation in action can to
finally are we there certainly for that priority actions be the and this be financial the on the randomly
since the the the the actions long the the will let wait must aware be that the actions not in the place can act the a comprehensive european guiding on food and food the fashioning the a such guiding offers fact also a opportunity to the unity the the many european  the to show
mr the president rapporteur bowis start the explanatory the are report with a quote the habsburglothringen  that he also morning repeated the   was there 
i part this judgement not because we can know that a human more is than only a body
that there already long rules for food there can we read in the bible since god this the are people israel 
a qualify the the concern the there the the people live on the safety the the food is however the are place
the  can i the way judgement the the  saramago itself to the human the not contaminated by what there through are mouths most but by what from are mouths is namely by what we all say
in this modern society are the choice for food enormous extended
we eat especially eurotaste things also if we know that they unsafe are
strange enough the there the the population however the large panic if there something trouble with the food
to the confidence again back to win be there very drastic measures taken which you you can ask or they from considerations need are
had with a european authority a dioxin and a bse prevent can be
i i is the make the new legislation not good response the the not failure the existing legislation
the up the independent inspectorates in the member the the ground the law maintain must therefore priority to have
same applies for the rapid vigilant system the member must ensure ensure that this system good working and they must the european commission time inform
mr the president commissioner byrne i wanted first my friend john bowis thank because he excellent work has done for the paper on food and especially also because he prepared was different amendments on to take from various political groups
this amendments forms to my opinion a earmarked improvement the the original proposal the the commission
the up the a independent and scientific zero european authority is a important step to the within the a need the all citizens against they demands because the necessary guarantees for the quality and the safety the their food
the  damage the the central she the the human doing and caused the by the eat the meat the bovine the as morning was said suffering the the mad the recent  in belgium the high concentrations phytosanitary the in the environment into the presence the all other  and chemical substances the a strong carcinogenic effect have are a source the distress and sometimes also the fear the the ordinary people
with the up the a european authority will in not low extent contributed be to a high  the the health
i wanted to finally all political groups thank the european party the socialists the greens the liberals because they agreement are has with a amendment that initially by i and the mr fiori was tabled with the intention the european authority a greater role to to know
this authority must if the were the man forms behind the coordination the the network the national bodies the the their turn in the individual region programmes a network the  for food must coordinate and hand
the is the intention that with this network the laboratories a wellrehearsed and daily control the the quality and the safety the foodstuffs the the on is exactly as mrs rothbehrendt just advocated that is a approach where i i in can find
this network must as close possible the the citizens are so they the this way slowly the again confidence to to in the european and national institutions
mr the president with the vote in the parliament the this first stage the consultation on the problem the the food concluded
i hope the that with this vote not point the the behind the to to quickly and efficient intervene the is the because to a sector the very close the the daily life the the citizens the and a the the most  is for us ability to the confidence the the citizens in the institutions and in the political back to place
the need the a increase commitment the now even still greater if the involved that the  expectations the the paper has raised not fully expressed are in the report the the mr bowis despite the fact that the rapporteur now are best has done
the up the the european authority and the definition the its powers forms although key the the by the commission proposed strategy but the responding is this not the
a european  must not limited continue to the up the a  and the apply the a few benefit and  rules how need this also are
there there a  link between healthy eat and good eat but this must still the the necessary aware the the consumers nutritional be in this policies is the matter quality first to places and the based local products sufficient support to give because they a large wealth the the european peoples forms
with the vote in the environment is the us managed a certainly balance to restore because we namely under the scope the  and a few important references to the role the the smes for the protection the the various customs have included
this is the reason why i for will vote
president colleagues i think that we with the report the the mr bowis a solid basis have for the further work and i think mr the commissioner that there now not few reason is why you the way the speak tomorrow not with the legislative proposal would to because the large majority the the parliament is the there now on agree the what way we further must to and that the such large majority is is under more and especially to thank the you mr the rapporteur you you a enormous good who
on the on the the matter i i not many more say we are the this all on agree
i would a few smaller things to the want to
i i a amendment tabled that to my feeling not as is although mr whitehead suggested that the unnecessary was
the must a independent authority are and therefore think i that as in paragraph the close links closetozero  in the english fact not should with no not with consumer but also with no otherwise
therefore i think that your amendment and my amendment perfectly  are
second point addition the authority are there still a number important things the must done
i out there two from we have urgent  need the european level we have urgent a positive list the ingredients the feed need
mr the commissioner the the work would i say and colleagues our role in the european parliament is also very important because we will with the annual with the confrontation the the director the the authority ensure must ensure that the authority also working because if they not working if they not good its work does than will the political account the us into
i think that that something is what we in the during the the years in the view will must the
mr the president i like the rapporteur thank because he as few colleagues already have said the amendments the all groups by means the  in the report has included i think that the rapporteur a clear objective our
as he itself in are report says is that in the first place the guarantee the the high safety the for food must apply a second of derivatives objective is the regain the the confidence that by the scandals a long tomorrow has behind
i like remind remind that in spain not only the scandal around the  has played that over year after concentrated still still consequences has but also the bse and the dioxin the last and worrying scandal in the with genetically modified transplanting from the usa the not for consumption suitable is but however in food rightly is has seems spain also to are
i think that the very important is to as the rapporteur proposed a  to follow
the first must there a  or authority be up the by integrity transparency and independence the characterised especially the independence is a fundamental necessary
the second must there urgent clear and accessible legislation to the third must there be worked with the bodies the other member with nongovernmental organisations consumer and international organisations
as my mr androlakis papayannakis already said will also we this report therefore support and adopt
mr the president i join i like the the the other colleagues and congratulate the rapporteur the mr bowis with are particularly constructive and logical approach the this problem
must i the way the  nut in this discussion say that i  to the biblical eye the the mr blokland the feeling had that he this debate the a higher level were there is because a time is been that we thought that this type affairs only by think intervene could be resolved
this said having think i however also that the this parliament and commissioner byrne to honour credit that the food now as high the the european agenda the
our citizens expect the us a conform and positive response and they have this also right the
according i is this absolutely necessary to the confidence the the consumer in this for both producers if consumers as important policy again at to restore
we have all our lessons learnt the the food in the years
by a system the uniform rules in to to will we to my wanted conviction the basis to for a legislation the the existing delays the this area 
this would clear the food in the whole chain increase
the reform the the foodstuffs the the eu can than the the level the the european union be carried
we want not in a situation into which food in the european union again only in own country be bought
a the the central elements the the reforms the the common agricultural is that we renationalisation the the cap in what form than also want prevent
therefore is the also as important that the legislation on food the european level the carried
therefore also am i particularly fortunately with a the the key the the paper on food namely the plan to a new european authority the to up
this authority must the responsibility to for scientific evidence for information and measures with the to all with the food coherent risks
a another issue which we in the next months to make will to is that the the genetically modified organisms gmos in the food we must open for the opportunities the the biotechnology
the would the agree a serious misconception can are to think that we with the biotechnology bad quality and unsafe food in house to
 offers us example the possibility the amount phosphorus in us food back to insist and the  that to improve we would in failed continue when we this benefits would ignore
i support however fully the introduction the clear  and standardised labelling with the to genetically modified food
also should food the genetically gm are or the genetically modified ingredients contain only in the chain be permitted when they extended are tested and than still only if relevant information clear the the label the the
president that the paper food itself not legislative importance has does absolutely not favour the the double gentlemen the the doubt has
the contains the first a commitment to the legislation global and carefully to renting to a independent  the to up and to the control better to organise
the has also a symbolic importance
the can and must the start are the a new beginning
future the the policy coordinated and integrated tackled and includes the the whole chain
the is good that rapporteur bowis the excellent work made has for a positive approach the the paper wants
in are report be not much changes proposed but be  the
as the rightly stressed that the authority the in the first place the the food must concentrate
however hope i that there also area will are for  the the level the the the between  and health
the policy must because not only at are the the prevent the damage the the health but also the the eventually the 
a second justified focus is the question to attention for the regional and the cultural differences in the  and the role the the central and small and the craftsmen the
late this immediately a call are to in the comprehensive package that the us  the you the the central and small and the craft not to inclusion
there is still a third focus need the far there in the report and the we still can input through amendment
both in the paper if in the  the about on communication one and on procedures in the case the emergency hand but there is not attention for the o as necessary internal and external 
however and in belgium can we of communicative can the thousand are for the control the the extent the the crisis and the are or the the the confidence the the consumer in the institutions
to the to the still this late us hope that the member the by the parliament and the commission shared vision  and that they especially also their responsibility take not only if  parts the the council but also if body the must ensure that the control in the field effective happening after the measures the europe in national legislation are implemented
colleagues president with the paper food is a important basis the for better food in the future and i hope also for a more environmentallyfriendly and citizenfriendly production the food
the rapporteur but also very many members in the commission including myself have the focus the the the authority and fact is that a little to regret
to regret because good food safe food especially benefit has the clear legislation
but i understand also that the many crises in europe and i refer here also to my country have demonstrated that we especially need have the a reference
the political has need the a reference to clear choices to can make and the consumer has need the confidence
therefore have we this authority need and therefore to we this rightly the necessary emphasis the
the is important that the authority independent can function
that have we clear in the report the and i forward i this absolutely on
the is also important that the authority its priorities can to that they proactive can work and that they recommendations can do the those the guarantee for the management
i regret the a little that there in the term only food the
i understand that food the point must are but there must however bridges beaten be to other areas as environment health and such
i hope that a dynamic future authority this dynamic however the the can to
the finally still this i think that we the this at in this political discussion our focus not must places the the location
i am there really the convinced that that the population  cold late
mr the president if member the the liberal group thank i the commission you for the paper and are ambitious objectives
there must quickly and the flexible way progress be made
that is in the important the both the consumers if the chain in europe
the commission environment health and consumer is to a sensible line has they like the the agency for food a the scientific area respectable body make that responsible is for risk and advice
the is the important that management under the responsibility the the member and the commission remains the and the the way also the political control subject is
to the confidence the the consumers in the safety the food to restore and to retain must the  with sufficient public resources can start
independence and independence the the service are a good point to the interests the the european consumers to must
the would therefore the best are if the agency not under the commission but independent would function therefore physical from the the commission
the agency must be located the a place with good infrastructure the the area the transport and information and the place the establishment must a good name have the the area the food
also the support the the every scientific bodies is the important the the choose the the location
i support therefore the amendments and which the the the decision on the location a principle issue like make
the paper that in large lines the supported by the report the the mr bowis preparing not binding policies and that is to regret
this the not way that the up the a european agency for food a very good matter is
the is only still necessary as some mr programmes already have said the independence the the agency to guarantee
this must the necessary financial resources and human resources available be the
we are the opinion that by a tax to lift the the profits the the  this resources can be budget
with the view the transparency would also unions and the various organisations affairs before must can make the the agency both the consumers if the environmental
a good scientific risk accompanied the a effective strategy direction public opinion is not sufficient to  under control to to
this witness the a technocratic vision the board the the cultural social and economic aspects the the 
in some cases requires the solution the a crisis more political like
look you example but to the current bse
the would the addition the shop  the feed must can ban and the  must can withdraw the pojarno the this rules not failure
mr the president i congratulate the mr john bowis with are good work
during this procedure i i often thought that we congratulate have had with the choice the the rapporteur
he has good resistance know to offer the the pressure the the this sensitive matter the him is exercised
i thank also commissioner byrne for the cooperation with us
the commission environment health and consumer has the council the the mr bowis followed and decided not position in to take on the location the the 
to my opinion was that a i decision
the is other the the important to determine what we the the  expect and what criteria we the the location to
the is in the important the the citizens the the whole union that there criteria to
the criteria are a good name the the area the food independence good scientific infrastructure with the best available technology and good connections the the area the transport and information
in amendment that i together with my colleagues  and fiori and many others behalf the group i tabled be this criteria clear the without that a position on the location the welcome
the criteria are same essential instruments to the common objective to achieve to know the as quickly possible restoration the the confidence the the consumers in the safety the the european food
in the debates is the demand to the has that the agency must be located in a city with european institutions because there otherwise not control the exercised can be
a such argument is astonishing and worrying and going in fact the soil under the idea the integration from
we can not seriously say that only a authority in the centre the the community the reliable way the its given task can out
as are there probably more causes for the low gentlemen the the euro than the establishment the the european central bank in frankfurt
itself think i not as i am the the force the the european  and the fundamental principles in the whole european union
mr the president also i like mr bowis the i congratulate with are revolutionised attempts to all opinions in are report to processing i thank him with particularly also for are willingness to in the report the more general understanding the food the to take
with the paper on food trying the the confidence the the consumers in very the chain to restore
rightly demands the consumers that they benzene food up to which the quality the specific criteria and standards meets
the relevant legislation must therefore very the area cover and a as horizontal possible nature have as should that now once if the to  is
i like here the attention draw the a number points
the early system has as is has to now to not to properly work the member are in large extent responsible for the shortcomings of
i i must therefore specific deadlines be the which each case the justified concerns the the commission must be pointed
the controls in the member must more and more be
what the european authority for food the must we keep the the independence the this body only than can they the threats risk evaluate and measures proposals for the management of in pending the the final political decisions
also must the authority ensure for transparency and all interested the possibility the access to the available information offer
i i are transparency and independence absolute conditions for safe and right food and that is us all objective
mr the president the recent incidents with the meat the diseased cows that in the chain rightly is has in netherlands and france and also the discussion the now again in britain place emphasise still agree that the monitoring and the control the the food further must be up
the regain the the confidence the the population in food is the greater important than only but for the food
the is because also to the confidence the the citizens in the authorities
the new european  must therefore a strong and independent institution to be the not only public the but also specific powers the to in the case the crises time effective measures for to to and to problems to into
we have therefore a as  possible organisation for view not a large bureaucracy
also will a part the the efficiency the the agency are in transparent decisionmaking and rapid publication the internet the are into and opinions slate the example the excellent functioning food and via via in dublin
this has the public right the
there must also be tremendous the the work the already existing organisations as  and the fao because duplication prevent must to be
end president must the political its responsibility not but
the decisions must end for account to the the european commission and the parliament must under other by means the a discussion on the annual the the work the the agency involved continue
the conclusion president prodi has large expectations raised in the runup to are presidency and commissioner byrne and rapporteur bowis have that hands and being must give in their paper
i think that they this very good in are managed and now see we like as soon possible legislation the this area
mr the president the chain in europe is although the safest in the world but bad practices and especially also recent scandals have to large problems led our commissioner the mr byrne has the this problems the  way responded
i congratulate him and also our rapporteur the mr bowis for their particularly logical and rational approach the the problem that today the table is
the eu must in the important the its citizens the highest possible standards for food apply
food and health are political priorities the the height is
we must those the us the this area advise can confidence farmers pojarno  sourced governments consumer scientists etc a endless list
we have especially need the a scientific body if reference or we now consumers or makers are or itself also contribute the the chain we must know what a acceptable balance is between risk and a considered choice the the consumer everything is to balance
safety and reliability mean not that we the possibility to to choose or even the cultural diversity obstruct a the the interesting amendments the the environment the the conservation the the european cultural heritage the the area the local 
risks must than also in a as early possible stage be recognised scientific evaluated and in the terms tiniest
action the european level is need because risks in a common market not the the national borders put
the  must a important role play in the current early system this system must be improve and extended to all areas the the food with including the animal
i am welcome with the broad agreement on the most principles there must a new scientific body to for the risk the the area the food this body must independent and transparent are responsibility make and answer the the needs on objectively research and commercial confidentiality and the must for a broad public accessible and comprehensible information available make
the most is however that this body the respect the its  and the confidence the the public can win and the governments the the member to can to its conclusions to accept
mr the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen the commission responding with this paper the the has sensitivity the the citizens the this area
the few that we us still the eat giving must in the first place healthy are and good tastes and must to the believe the the consumer also the environmentallyfriendly way be produced
when we on food speak and the want guarantee must we with many aspects account the
there there already a large number organisations and institutions federations and groups the the to objective have the the food to monitor
within the internal market the europe with are trade and are free movement the goods rice still more the question to the competence for the legislation and control the this for the european citizens as important area
the commission the now for a european authority in the life to to
i welcome that proposal to but i i time the question what powers task and influence such european body the
that are also the questions the we in the committees have dealt
i like therefore mr bowis congratulate with are good and balanced report which he the many different ideas has brought
the authority must responsible to are for the assess the risks and together to work with the bodies the the member
transparency is the very important
the citizens demands transparency because they good informed want are
the authority must therefore information offer the for the public easy accessible and understandable is
the authority must also closely work with the institutions the there already are that the in that information statistics and data mutual accessible must are
the knowledge and experience the others can as be adopt and then in very europe be use
we need not all again the wheel from to find
the this way can we our experience parts
as see i the future authority
mr the president mr the commissioner i like i with the the many congratulate the the to the the rapporteur the mr bowis
there are already several saws on food mentioned but there is also a acceptable the reads that the the everything but little must eat
the supply the the extremely  in the shops makes that long possible
the eating the many citizens the way which they with food deal and the lack the knowledge on the prepare the a balanced usage are all things which also a new authority or agency nothing can change
also if products safer be the consumers their own responsibility
mr the commissioner i i the impression that there still more controllers are and still less producers
i fear that europe again the risk the a cumbersome apparatchiks in the life to to that not to action in the is
how will the the european powers precise can codes the the the the national supervisory
i am afraid that we ourselves a new block the the mislead made
this new body will not for a final breakthrough the the area the consumer can ensure
who will who the responsibility to if in the future the next  allows
in the with the enlargement the the european union discuss we time again on the competences the powers
that must also with the to the food a central point are
also in the future must the the regulation the economic  certainly the principle be applied that the  pays
there the in the paper on food not always a clear line followed
the specific timetable to the objective to achieve see there to according the wish the the many involved very different from
by the debate the today can we the creation the this body not more prevent
i think however that we also not already to very must expect that thanks this body in the future everything better the
mr the president my mr the mr bowis has the matters the he has been good played
i question i however the the or the matters fact the about had must be
we debate in this parliament still again on details the proposals the we presented to but we questions us not the or the proposals there the would must are
in the most member there already bodies the the area the food
we have scientific committees the opinion produce the the commission
we have the world in geneva
what can a european authority this still the add
they will mainly the work the the existing bodies still agree on do
its most function is public extremism
a european authority is a literally attempt to a sceptical public that to convince that the european institutions the the a or other way something some at
would the new body the british bse or the belgian dioxin have prevent
as the mr blokland rightly says probably not
we must recognise that we here to make have with the law the the reunification 
as we still more new bureaucratic levels create and still more money spend to we this still less for back
we to to hear that we not question should to the the gentlemen the the money that we the the human health spend
we must if politicians however limited resources distribute and therefore must we such questions precisely the to
would the enormous sums the this new body will costs not better can be spent the dehp or the the prevent the smoking or the the safety
probably would this money the this areas many more that the  lives but no is prepared this question to to
i address i now the the question the the location the this body
according i is its most task to ensure for better coordination the the work the the existing bodies
the directors the the national bodies must the administration to forms
they must the their own bureau continue are for their own computer
the location for the new body must than also not barcelona helsinki or italy be but internet cyberspace
than would they only effective transparent and accessible are
the would a typical century solution are
mr the president ladies and gentlemen in unlike to the previous speaker like i very clear say that the today to deal paper on food the copout is for the institutions the the european union to the highest possible level the food to achieve and the confidence the the consumers back to win
we have this document because not without reason the let to
the subject was course the strong different ways viewed that is from the discussions the the last months the has
therefore deserves the rapporteur a long congratulating because he the managed is the different approaches and ideas in a them report together to summarise
even on the central the the paper the institution the a authority for food were the opinions however already strong divided
i like also not conceal that i i the the publication the the paper against this authority i expressed
now i will the the vote however together with a broad majority because this i i from for this authority will favour must i the commissioner the next the the heart express
mistaken you the not there there many doubt there is many criticism
the you the proposals the the parliament seriously and concentrate you the work the the authority the scientific work and risk
the is particularly important and this emphasise i that the authority not addition the current system the consultation committees is function
the cooperation between the authority and the research in ispra and the veterinary bureau in dublin must clear be regulated
avoided you does or parallel work in the different institutions
what the specific fulfil the the authority the must in the first place clear are how this the financed
from the parliament welcome we a plan not only to we demands there even a
how staff are there need
what is a appropriate timetable for the up the a such body
used you the paper also to in the member more rules by to express
if the design for the more than legal regulations there just as look if the health the i if rapporteur i received than am i very optimistic voted
you had however still but agree about what you on the believes says mr the commissioner
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president mr the commissioner mr programmes first must i rapporteur bowis congratulate with the excellent work that he has done
i i have we a extremely important aspect layoffs namely the idea the a network for the european authority the is the intention that this authority a supplementary function the and not in the place into the other organisations the the organisations the certain member already for food have
the is however also matter to favour for a balanced approach the the problem the articles and the the treaty the the european union to because if general rule that a high level the protection the the human health and the the consumers assured must be
the this principles based also the priority attention for the human health
the must there therefore for ensure that the european union on as high possible  on food has this there although overall consensus but examined must still be what economic consequences this approach has for the industries
in article the the treaty the there namely the reminded that the union to task has a harmonious balanced and sustainable development the the economic activity to promote
therefore any  the the has the a sector if the the the food what one the the engines the the european industry is the the total output in the  and million workers must where be the on the this double recital both principles are because at the the guarantee the overall prosperity and welfare in the community
any action the protection the the consumers the only feasible and become for the consumers itself if as damage for the overall economic welfare the prevent this would example the case are if the process the this sector faced was with excessive obstacles the the growth the the economy and the employment in the way would are
i need therefore the commission from to as there new with incapable be beaten and there acts the table to too  and too bureaucratic burden to prevent with particularly for the smes
mr the president the promotion the a independent european authority the responsible can be with research the the level the food is a extremely important objective
that objective can implemented be in cooperation with the national bodies the the responsibility for the control must to the must prevent to be that in the shadow the the debate on the paper the public opinion still more fear the for a bureaucratic europe that although the quality the its products can influence but not in the is short shortcomings to make with all fraudsters the the health the the consumers undermine
i will in this framework but one point the the report the the mr bowis the i the be congratulate to the to
the opportunity there that a strategy the the whole chain scope the the agriculture to the production and the distribution the economic concentration still further in the hand working what the expense would to the the smaller companies and the based products without that the consumers this itself something that quickly
small apparent and based products are the wealth the were european region
the objective the food can and must therefore in agreement the be with this specific situation the as many mr programmes already have stressed a economic but also a cultural gentlemen has
president i like the mr bowis sincerely congratulate with are very so report on the paper food
the is a very sensitive subject that after the european food to keen discussions has led and the discussion is by the mr bowis the a sound way in are report processed
in netherlands has the discussion the concentrated the a european agency for food fact a type european counterpart the the american 
moreover a counterpart the also as by president prodi the are office in the scaffolding is the
for the paper that now for us is and also the report the mr bowis is the only from the a agency a agency accompanied the a has tasks the accompanying legislative measures that confidence must restore
the paper will than after the in the member and also here in the parliament good is examined also a legislative form to in a new directive
the tasks are than independent scientific research a opinion independent controls and inspections and a rapid vigilant system but certainly also coordination to the confidence to restore
i i ensure on the independent inspections
why
i think that the coordination with dublin better guaranteed must are and i think also that the without previous permission also in the member must can to control
there are amendments the that point
legislation standards and the the the rules remains the the institutions the this responsible are in europe and that are than the commission if  and the council and the parliament if legislator
that the not way that i still a large wish i
i would the as like compared have with the  and in the new proposal would i also  and approval the products the the agency have want accept
i hope that this in the new proposal however still attention for will are
first like i the many members thank the the this report have involved as you know enjoys a strategy for food the highest priority in the commission
i thank special the commission environment health and consumer and its rapporteur the mr bowis for the large agreement which they this position has developed
i i large appreciation for the rapporteur and the other members the this parliament they have the time taken to this issues indepth with i and with my staff to discuss
the result of is this excellent agreement this is the another example the the cooperation the can there between our two fantastic institutions
in the paper the the commission on food the a important and ambitious programme described for legislative reforms the completion the the eu the farmer to plates
together with our proposals for the up the a european authority will this programme in important extent contribute to the protection the the health the our citizens and to the restoration and the conservation the the confidence the the consumer in the food
the european consumer expect rightly the highest possible level the food our ambition is systems to develop the this can ensure
a  the farmer to plates with a good legislation and effective control is the only way to a high level the confidence in the european food to achieve
the commission working already hard the the in the paper announced programme for legislative reforms the this area
there are already different proposals tabled the the council and the parliament i mention example the package proposals for reform and adaptation the the 
now we the there however on have would i the speakers the have out the the need the a certain sensitivity with the to local  and traditional products that want point that this issue in the  the regulated
we work also the a number important changes in the systems as the by the competent authorities in the member and the level be carried
the commission will the this point in the next time proposals adopt for a revision the the 
in the paper confirms the commission its intention to the proposals to protection the the  to base the reliable scientific data
we see the authority if the scientific body the is the the serving the the the community in the broadest sense the the floor the both the consumers if the institutions and the member
the authority must also good visible are for the public they must the how authority be the the area the affairs on the scientific aspects the the food in europe
the commission will a proposal adopt for a regulation on the general principles and objectives the the  this regulation will the framework forms for future  measures the the area the food
this proposal the the up the a european authority the the community will for the opinion on scientific and technical issues this can the commission the general principles the the  the implement to
we are the plan this proposal in the commission the to take the november
this timetable reflect again the important that the commission the this matter importance the is also in agreement with the timetable as that is announced in the paper
the commission objective to force the the legislation in so the authority actually can be up in
i would wish that this more could i know mr the president that you the opinion shares
i look than also from to the full support the the parliament so the treatment the this particularly important document legislation in a as briefly possible time can done
i i the debate in the parliament on the paper with many interest followed
i feel i was by the large extent the agreement between the positions the the parliament as the in the by you discussed draft to expression to and the paper itself
this will the task the the commission to with a balanced proposal to to a proposal that so possible account the with the opinions within the parliament and the the many interested the the area the food considerably facilitate
you will understand that i not can promise that i already your positions  my the the service in this parliament shows however the that i my effort best i
i i the previous occasions in the parliament and in other fora said that i the role and the involvement the the parliament itself the the introduction the the legislation on the up the the authority if a important element consider the a full acceptance the our ideas on a authority
i declare today still agree public that i there still still the convinced am that the parliament a full  must to have the the introduction the this legislation
this is the right way i support the wish the the parliament to the articles and the the treaty in the sense to to apply
to finally like i you mr the president your rapporteur the mr bowis the  the environment the other involved committees and the parliament if whole thank together have we common efforts for a better regulation the the food to a good end can to
thank you the mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take to at place
mines
mr the president mr the commissioner mr programmes the is not the first time that this parliament the going on the problem mines
in the last years is this problem even one the the driving forces been and has in political respect led to the signature the the treaty the ottawa
this campaign was time started by a number ngos programmes they was supported by the red cross by europe and the european union if such and is almost a model become for how you the international level campaign can to
this was one the the fastest signed treaties in the history the international treaties within scarcely a year was the by forty parliaments ratified which the operational could be
the last meeting in geneva has let see that there considerable progress the this area is made not only the the  but also the the 
there is however course still very many work the the shop and therefore must we all the proposal the the commission if a good matter welcome
i hope even that this ability to pressure from to exercise this speed which the union has action the the level the mines a example can role for other treaties the the ratification wait and which this parliament always many important has adopted i objective with particularly the the up the a international court for crimes against the humanity to but not to speak on the moratorium the the death
we are welcome with the proposal the the commission i must however the say that the commission foreign affairs and the commission development close have work to this proposal here and this still to improve what the few points also is happened
i will a few points mention the militants compared with the proposal the the commission and the how than also a specific step forward mean
first point we keep that in the hope that the parliament here support the the that the stocks mines where many countries still on have also countries the to the signatories properly destroyed be
the second point the a series budgets i hope that the parliament the here that agree can are
mr the commissioner we have not only tried your proposal further to simplify which we end the three lines are have a general line a line for research and one for humanitarian  but we have also a simplification made in the comitology
a another important element is that this parliament not asking to general affairs but to million euro for the period plus the  plus the money for the humanitarian line we have the because on hard facts and not only on a resolution
from own experience know i namely mr the commissioner that you without money difficult specific can are
precisely because the funds from the  crops are million euro is considerably more than what the previous time was allocated want we like that the commission a own  the established the to the consistently and transparent way giving to give the actions in this framework
this are according i the most laps aspects and they conform with a transparent and responsible administration
what the political aspects the will we later still the the the resolution back
my last point the the amendments i i there again the that i to budget reasons against the amendments and am
i like like that on amendment in parts the voted so the wording the the whole text can be improve this is namely to my feeling by wrong interpretations backwards has
mr the president mr the commissioner i thank you and hope that already this innovative proposals not only by the parliament be adopted but also by the council and the commission in recital be taken
mr the president even in the ordinary language fact the floor my already the risk in the italian there than also the expression  persona  what as approximately means you you a document calamity
if european union must we united action to to achieve that there not mines more produced be also must we ensure ensure that the stocks destroyed and the on areas  be the victims including so children  and resources to social and economic reintegration to and the affected community the necessary everywhere be is
therefore must there actions taken be for not only more awareness but also to to prevent that the problem the the background the been by other issues
both in the report if in the opinions the the committees the are praise about on the highly role the the parliament and the european union play the the eradication the mines and on the economic contribution the the un
as mrs bonino already clear and clear from the before has done is with the regulation the the commission a new step forward the
we have various amendments tabled to more clarity to achieve the lines to strengthen and to rationalise but also to our own commitment for  and destruction the the stocks to strengthen this must however in cooperation done with a large number ngos programmes the is namely especially thanks this organisations that the this problem now as if something that not longer postponed must be
there is however one weak point there are there very what but i objective with particularly the one and that has with our own policy to make we must pressure exercise the finland that the treaty the ottawa still not has signed and the greece that the not has ratified
otherwise  europe programmes credibility the the union is namely favour the participation the all countries the the treaty the ottawa
in the report the   is clear visible what progress there with the treaty the ottawa is made
the global is not only a reduction the the production and the trade to there but also a reduction the the number victims the the  and such although there still many to many the that arms in the world is
very many problems are still unresolved especially because countries if the united states the treaty still not have signed or because countries if china and russia on enormous stocks have
europe must a way see to find to ensure to ensure that this  although the history eradicated be but in the  anchored continue let they us remind remind that we not more must deaths with our fatal productions
mr the president we are here all aware aware the the extent the the misery the by mines caused the our mr programmes emma bonino and  morgantini have there just still to referred
the is a serious problem there are the namely still very many active mines in the on
there the even about on numbers the to million hence the important the the treaty the ottawa the international community can now specific action take to a end to make the this appalling situation including especially the less developed countries to suffering have
there can now as said last something taken be also already continue there still the what problems there a number important countries they are here mentioned has because still not signed
we regret the than also that one member finland not signed has and that a other greece the treaty still not ratified has mrs morgantini has this already the out
than urges the immediately also the next issue the the european union notably the commission must already the possible take to ensure to ensure that the countries the the treaty the ottawa not signed have that be do
the is the important that the commission us nobody what they intends is to do and than especially if the is to the countries
its authority in be will course more to greater are if the council and the member explicitly say that the european union in the framework the its foreign action in not case mines will use than the the the commitment the such arms will help
the is the the the the important to the actions the the union and the the the member as good possible to coordinate and ensure to ensure that they coherent are
also here again is the the commission the a essential role can and must role also here again must the commission say what they intends is to do
the seems us however least just course that there in the budget resources be budget to ensure to ensure that the to take actions also really effective can are
the regulation the the commission is us to vague for
we wobbly earlier to the up the a specific line for the up the mines whole from the research or food we believe also that the useful would can are to same a central  the to to for all actions the this area
what the actions itself the we must there how than also for ensure that already existing mines all through mines destroyed be to to prevent that they the the black market into
the has little sense the  and the support the victims continue to to if we continue with the production and sale the mines
we must especially also preventive activities develop and more in research invest especially in research to 
to finally is the essential that the efforts the the area the  increased be
that is the only way to ensure to ensure that the already out actions worked the the these to
the countries the the treaty signed have must the priority to to the require not speech that for the treatment the victims resources aside must be the
we would like see that the commission also here again clear said what they the plan is to take given the experience to now to and the fact that the european union the this area a important role the the has taken
the  is extremely make there are resources need and political like
we have here to make with a enormous challenge the extent the the tragedy is however such that only a large commitment and heavy efforts a end the the situation can make
mr the president gentlemen colleagues we know all what consequences mines have although there in individual cases often justified military reasons there to they to use
this mines cause at many suffering especially under the civil and under children
often do they also the development the countries for long time destroying because large areas under the mines are
the is therefore a extremely good matter that the commission and the european union here together something the do and there concern for want to that the this area a coordinated policy the held
we want the commission with our oral question encourage to the the way continue to to and this initiative force the to to
the is indeed necessary the european and the international efforts the activities the the development and the directly by the commission illthoughtout actions to coordinate
also the equipment the  must good be organised we must therefore research finance to sitetosite and cleanup and to instruments the the ground simple to use are so they with particularly in developing the usefulness are
there is also the the commitment the military and turned still the everything and still what to coordinate
my commission like you also proposals consultation to commit with the  to to into or the force this special can be used so europe the this area a leading role can play
we must than certainly certain separately for mine supply to clear to make where our priorities are
the on international treaties are still not by all countries signed or to the most different reasons still not ratified
i think that we this campaign also must to to to achieve that the political responsible in the countries the balance to make between the military usefulness the this mines and the consequences the they for the local population and the involved region have
the balance would them must do decisions the arms not more to use behaves must we this countries help political alternatives for the use the such mines to develop
i think that the possible is also in such regions the political relations the a sensible way as to influence that the local government the political force the to the circle to break the problem is because that the says itself to want protect but end the own population longterm damage community
i can the commission therefore only but urge the not to to to a technical research to the way which somewhere with financial resources aid can be is we must also the political conditions create to the situation to improve
i like my appreciation express for the ambitious and constructive attitude the the parliament as the also clear that from the report the mrs bonino on the regulation this attitude strengthened the contribution the the european union the the fight the mines
the is not really a surprise that a report the mrs bonino a as strong and important document is
i am grateful for the tone the the report but i am there not really surprised on
end has the european parliament within the union the role taken in the fight against landmines
the parliament proposed in if first the issue the a horizontal line the the item also proposed the if first a good legal for the for the a broad range the actions the we the this important area could take
the parliament has there in high extent to contributed that the union the the conference the ottawa in the led to the treaty the ottawa which landmines were banned and eradicated has elected for a proactive drafting
the challenge to this treaty fully from to to was for the commission the to after to think on the way which the contribution the the european union the the fight the landmines can be strengthened
the result the this  is here for you in the form the a proposal for a regulation
i like also the crucial role mention the is played by the civil by very motivated ngos and especially also by the international campaign for a ban the landmines
their efforts are the large important for a successful implementation the the treaty the pressure the they have exercised the governments all the world has there in high extent to contributed that end a encouraging high number countries to the treaty is become and the has ratified
in the last eight year have we from the budget with over million euro contributed the the fight the landmines only already in by the union this more than million euro from
of was million euro for for  that is many more than what other international organisation than also has spent
some members the the parliament have perhaps the publication given the we have made for the conference the previous month where the progress the the implementation the the treaty the ottawa was discussed this publication shows the strong different actions the we in all corners the the world take and the all aspects the step cover
i mention with particularly the tremendous work the the common centre for research
that we the the financial contribution the this objective make is however not enough
the objective the the regulation is a strategic and comprehensive approach the to to then can we our efforts than looking the closely defined direction the us the way point to us joint goal a world without landmines
before i within the the excellent report on the regulation like i first still a few general comments make in answer the the interesting and valuable speeches the the mr miranda and the mr brok
course have we all to objective the treaty the ottawa universal validity to to
the european union has a very clear position they has that explained in the common action the which was tried so possible countries to signature and ratification the the treaty to they
to one fact can i however not across the persuasion the the union the the day the for the achieve the this objective the obviously somewhat the links the by the problems the some member still still have with signature and ratification the the treaty
we to this point that by the gentlemen member in are speech was mentioned regular under the attention the the involved member
doubt can the fact that the european union financial support its the step potential suffer countries encourage to the sign the the treaty
in the communication and the regulation is in this respect a certain extent the conditionality there we should however not already to dogmatic are
we must the specific situation in certain countries accept
we must people the our aid hard need have not penalties also if their government the still not sufficient commitment for the implementation the the treaty
this is a regular recurring dilemma
the gentlemen member has this dilemma in the past as confirmation under words the we have still again the task to humanitarian aid to provide the people while the humanitarian aid often need is if result the the activities the their own government
we should however people not penalties for the fact that they such was government have
what the countries the expect we that they the just mentioned common action support
this is not acquis community in the strict legal sense the the floor but we will them course encourage the landmines from their  to to the production the or the trade in landmines to put and the treaty the ottawa to sign and to ratify
i like still the a point like that the mr miranda earlier today mentioned i think the particularly important that we also look to projects for the destruction the the existing stocks landmines
this can for environmental ensure and the costs also many money but we must there in the future however priority the give
i like the attention the the parliament draw the the slovenian international bail this fund has in are only  there with the aid the the european union the united states and a number other countries a regional mineclearance up with projects in the whole stabilising
after the events earlier this year in zagreb and the still recently events in belgrade must we hope that there in the future in europe not landmines more will be the
the improve the the cohesion between the action the the community and that the the member which the gentlemen member about is in fact the  the the together with the regulation published communication
we have for a flexible and coordination and not for a rigid and centralised approach elected
step is the  when the the the circumstances is between this are for any situation otherwise
therefore to we also not for to all actions the the area the step also not all actions within the community in one programme and in one line to concentrate
we to rather for to a radio in to to with participants from nongovernmental organisations and other relevant involved groups
the is the intention that this group the commission assisting the the drafting the a general strategy for step
i will now specific respond the the  first like i like briefly respond the the few amendments the the parliament the the commission in their current form difficult can accept
few of i i already just touched in my answer the the gentlemen member
the first would the as i already earlier i said a according i although had but despite however counterproductive mistake are to the accession to the treaty the ottawa if hard condition to to for european aid the 
the clearly themselves that we only very rarely aid will offer the countries the this treaty not have signed
however will there certainly cases are which we to political or humanitarian reasons however the population want help in despite the their government
therefore am i against amendment
i understand and respect the intention the the proposal to all financial resources for step with exception the echo and the  in one horizontal line to concentrate however am i there not the convinced that this us the flexibility will offer the need is to a maximum effectiveness the the actions the the european union to achieve
the is possible that the horizontal line in the during the the time more attention and more recognition will to but the is also important that we by means the geographical lines and legislation the relationship with the regular national and regional programmes in the the
myself would therefore inclined are no to say against the amendments and
to same reason are i i the for the central  for step requested human and administrative resources sufficient to a good implementation to guarantee
we want not additional bureaucratic areas create with a small team and a good use the the networks scope you same results
i would than also against amendment want are
we want nor a new committee or this now a administration or a  is
the parliament know that we there this already many to many the have you know also that we precisely have proposed the external aid by the european commission as to change that there a end is the all required controls the individual projects and we us in place of in our discussions with the member want up the the general strategies and the programming
this do we example already with meda
we will this also to do with all existing geographical committees
in place the now again a new committee in the life to to to we for a radio in to to the for us if forum can action and more authority has than the experts the national governments here can we than discussions to and decisions take on the general  which horizontal application and annual assessment are requires
therefore can the commission the amendments and not accept
to finally like i still a comment make on the tender the  i like you warn against your plan to more restrictions in to to for participation the our giveaway
we want not only a greater local capacity and more input the the local business encourage but we must also use can make the the best expertise the there is and the the best material where that but to to is
usually will that within the european union are but in exceptional cases can that also elsewhere are
i can therefore amendment not accept
i will not all by the gentlemen member proposed amendments discuss the the commission like accept because that are there a many they will to my opinion a important improvement the the regulation mean
they confirm the feeling the determination and ambition that we all parts
we have still many work to do if we the objectives the the treaty the ottawa namely to this landmines within the next ten year from to racial want achieve
this regulation means a small but to my wanted conviction important step in the good direction
i hope that we can continue count the the support the the parliament for a successful outcome the the legislative process
mr the president some the us are already years involved the the attempts to a end to make the the tragedy the the mines
the is a issue that the public opinion in many the our member very concerns
governments have their involvement let will and large sums money committed
the ngos programmes are in response the the need if dorado from the on same however must we now such four year after the first conference on landmines in geneva and more than a year after the force the the treaty the ottawa recognise that many countries and thousands people usually in the poorest areas the the world still still be occurring by mines and  weapons
why is the all as slowly
the seems i that there three types problems are
the first must we the our objectives clear say what we want achieve
we must the campaign for the eradication the mines not use if a opportunity to western governments with particularly the united states western  or the western industry the to the
general about are the western governments not the problem but precisely a part the the solution
we must our political attention concentrate the the were guilty conflict parties and irresponsible governments the have proven the not to they to the civil and the mines use if nothing and no disaster 
still important is that the practical step the address the the priorities the safe make the areas where the suspicion the  the restoration the the ordinary life and the economic development in the way the and aid the demining
the second must the international community its efforts the world but especially also in the countries countries itself better to coordinate
we must see that we the real extent the the  still still not really know also know we not how efficient our  in fact are been
we must here quickly a research to up in all by landmines countries countries so we more can see what there still must done
the third must we ensure ensure that the money good ends
i am there really a little proud the that the european commission the the area the step the the  the world is
given the ability the the european union to the efforts the many countries to coordinate would the use the this extensive resources however more worked the the these can to
there are many reasons the to mention why the large words still not in just large action are into
in certain sense is the  a typical example the the more general helplessness the the commission to the resources the they to its available has also effective to use
the commissioner for foreign relations has already earlier recognised that the way which the external programmes the the commission currently be carried disgraceful is
the commission must both the quality the its programmes if the speed which the be carried to improve
under leadership the the mr patten start there the a and another in the good direction to change
the communication and the regulation the the commission on mines are extremely useful documents two essential elements be the however not mentioned
with are amendments like the parliament this  catching multiannual financing the step must be concentrated within a few line and there must within the commission a with sufficient resources were section to the special responsible is for not only the framework but also the planning and implementation the step with including the the contractors the contracts
a as large possible commitment good leadership and management forms together the key for a effective use the the resources
we want not fine gesture more but real action and tangible results
president the socialist group shares the proud the the mr the orden just called on the role the the european union
i was a number years ago in a schoolroom in  in afghanistan and i looked this how children were out the the different forms the landmines
and when i a the the landmines in the form the a  looked was i that landmines designed be so children agree to play and injured are and when was i also what the moral gentlemen was the those the this type affairs produce
when i i also given that campaigns the schools and under the population the  means are for the prevent the victims
and a important part the amendments the this the we support i also the i from my group must round
in the second place is the clear that the often battle with the tap open is because while this mines in afghanistan by all clubs were from were they elsewhere again the
and than think i also back the  where i working with organisations the disabled injured has by the landmines the itself affairs  and 
when i i two things learnt
you must the local population use
people also already are they injured can a hope things itself again do
i was also that the not is to the deaths the people through landmines but that scourge objective is the this means and that makes the moral issue as been
when i in angola was looked i the  institutionalised aid and the had a method which they together with the local population  where the mines areas and very strategic certain areas 
that has i two things learnt you you experts need in the case the the  institutionalised aid  and the local population very very essential and you must then strategic up
not all the  that is extremely duration and take many to long but strategic areas again kind so the local economy again can to work etc
that were i the the idea to therefore not through the national authority angola and not in the first place through complex structures but simply through strong ngos in the local population good organised with the authorities to work as they in angola try to do
same aware you that there in angola again also again landmines be the and that brings i the the point that the mr patten to the has the
commissioner you says i am against a number amendments
i think however that if you this still agree very good through is there a few amendments are the you mentioned the to my feeling to make have with campaigns with transparency with access for ngos with things the also very good to the this at but the more can
i believe not that you afraid must are for the amendments the that point from us parliament
we want not do we want not more comitology we want area for you we want that the efficient happening and i believe that we the this point also not in the priorities differences
perhaps that you still agree the a few paragraphs you are to however to look or the already the points indeed now the a  must be expressed what however also not as easy from a english mouths is
the that point believe i are you and the parliament the same on
we feel us if socialist group a part the the large international  and we are this proud the together with the other colleagues here in this parliament
mr the president antipersonnel are a even evil because they not intended are to to deaths but to people disabled to make and the victims their family and countries to are
think the the   in afghanistan
the production that is unfortunately  but the detection and destruction huge
the will year take before they all from are and there be there still still distributed
the liberal jan orange  were this problem five year ago here in the parliament the the item and i think that he all praise the the parliament deserves he has this matter in the public has the and the is now a  in sight
also the union does the this area large and efficient efforts
however can there still more done be
there there aircraft the in a space the time large documents area can 
i i a such machine in kosovo given but they was the that at not in use
mrs bonino and the mr patten danger rightly the that the in first body the  must destroy that costs because only a group the what the destruction the difficult to find mines costs
mrs bonino and the mr patten danger also also still rightly the that the parliament and the council the not with the administration should interfere i i carefully listened to the words the the mr patten because he is apparently the believe that we us still more taking must the
i am the in principle agree with are position
we should us not with the administration interfere but we must the criticism exercise the the commission if they its outright not to properly effect
this need we the commission however not the the a distance that to administrations
the is a mistake the the parliament permanent practised
the commission must free are in the exercise the its powers and we must the freedom have its  to throw if i as must say if they its work not properly does
to finally thank i mrs bonino
the is project as such perceived rapporteur to have
thank you for the good report
mr the president within has structures the very rarely something news
the ban the mines has led however to a process that a excellent example is the the way which nongovernmental organisations and the european parliament objectives could the and determination could achieve the national institutions execrable or unrealistic were
after the breakthrough in ottawa must we ensure ensure that the union and its member in both their bilateral relations if in their internal legislation the necessary consequence take they must also their leading role keep and their political like consolidate and retain
end will the far must to that the treaty by everyone the signed and ratified including by my country finland the signature and ratification the the treaty must also for the countries a condition are for accession to the european union and must therefore in the acquis community be included
the before report and especially the excellent opinion the the commission development create good conditions for further measures this must at are the the operational aspects the mine and not the the find the  and expensive technological solutions
 are in this the very promising
the  the the its on a political dimension the this work and the oral questions the the mr brok and the mr miranda the the commission give important guidelines
all institutions the the european union must initiative show and the as that the poor countries the the most under the  to suffering have the effective way the the programme be involved
the responsibility for the monitoring is course the the commission but we must there with at all for ensure that the joint work to this scourge world from to eradicate as quickly possible concludes can be
we can than our encourage initial in a world without mines
mr the president our group the the already long time active are with all actions and measures the the this area need are the adjournment the production destruction the stocks and end the trade to the up the  concerning the the affected people and awareness
i like however the next comment make the ensure the  is directly proportion the the inability the the international community to political solutions to find for large issues
when a country the example unsafe feels the the border with a another country will are government easier the resort take to 
if the international community not know how they the de from the nationalism and the conflicts must to and if they not in the is the to to the political solutions decisions the involved easier to  the to to
this must we especially also in the monitoring the in example the balkans i i to the west and the european union with their political interventions the certainly a part the the responsibility for the fact that the half the the balkans illustrated is with mines
to finally like i mr the president still say that special action need is for the issues in the with the balkans i like than also from this place insist the  ratification by the greek government the the treaty the ottawa
mr the president in cambodia be mines the perpetrator guards mentioned
this fatal replete the chance and sometimes many years after the conflict problem by going the the victims itself are postponed bombs the the social and economic restoration the whole region programmes among and the reintegration the the victims itself
if  the the call to a earth without mines support i the i the report the emma bonino because the in the good direction is
two year after the signature the the treaty the ottawa are there unfortunately enough still still enormous stocks mines least what the  mines the
for the mines the still still not  are must urgent new identification and carry be found
the national actions must absolutely be supplemented with financial contribute the the european union
addition is the the essential important that the union if whole and the countries the treaty the ottawa sign and especially ratify
there the many the the stake because if in wars already certain rules apply for some in the form the  for others from under the treaties makes the use the mines this certainly not part the from
mine is not military problem more but a humanitarian challenge
europe must the not to to the role the donor
the must a conservationist play the the them the the most adequate  still before new arms be used
the is then the the member to this process in the international organisations to support
to finally must europe the process the ottawa support and strengthen so there not new weapon is that as now the case is any twenty minutes new victims makes
mr the president gentlemen colleagues i support the initiative the the community the fight the mines the much i
if i i the pictures the by mines  children for the spirit out from i personally the conclusion that any euro the the used to this more to combat wellspent is
i i with representatives the ngos about the criticism had the the fact that in the paragraphs and the the resolution the activities the military and ngos be mixed
the ngos enjoy by their years work the confidence and the appreciation the the population and i am afraid that a such dilution both the independence the the ngos if their relationship with people in need final can infrastructures
people who the  staff a justified mistrust that by many years war is grown
we must therefore everything in the work to to the work the the ngos sustainable to support
mr the president i will the very briefly the and the regulatory time the one minute not exceed i like only my displeasure express on the fact that in such important debate the council not represented is while the without doubt the institution is the the most opportunities has to to act the the area that here the the item is
mr the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen i like mrs bonino very you for its work thank
the treaty the ottawa is a decisive step in the international fight for the ban the use storage production and transfer the mines
i welcome the therefore the very to that this treaty now by this regulation the into in a community strategy the improvement the the coordination the cohesion and the transparency the this mine and the the control this
the european union must its claims the a movement also the this area up
the austrian government has this subject always extremely important found
as today already is said the also the parliament the there already years that are
the parliament is the driving force behind already this efforts and i think that we there still a account comes must do
i like stress that more countries must be window the treaty the ottawa to sign than the this treaty soon to ratify to international coordination and  the the victims possible to make
to to start would all eu this treaty must sign
i consider that if a based duty also within the european community
the reconstruction in the involved countries and the return the refugees be by the mines course serious back
as this risk present is will the difficult continue the  population that to convince that they to house can return
the european union is the  often the the donor in the involved countries be international actions carried
the problem the the mines but also the devoted is often to large for the involved regions so there without international cooperation not really effective aid can be granted
the international community must a coherent and coordinated position adopt
the support the  victims research and technological development must be promoted
there must absolutely a ban the the production the mines in the eu and the the implement the mines from the eu to
that objective must we all without more if a priority as
mr the president the am i that there now with this regulation last a european legislation on mines there and that we today the good report deal that mrs bonino this has written
there was already said that the european parliament already in the previous term the commitment the the european union endorsed to the fight the to made against a the the helmets  and  arms the there there
as the mr patten already said has the commission development in a line for mine introduced
unfortunately enough the the amount the the line steadily the the a way the versa proportion is the the emphasis the we here the this subject to
because we currently also are are the budget good to approve like i just consider the the figures where the i to is
this year who we on million euro
the council and the commission want that amount next year to million reduce while the parliament a increase with million the relation the the year proposed
this figures to not many for if the to the solution the a problem is which million people in countries are involved which people per year people are and which especially many children the victims be in el salvador mention they the children theatres children because they the destruction in are help because they not hands poor or feet more have
i like therefore the the council the here not present is and the the commission let know how important the is that this amount the increased unfortunately be there namely for any  my between the and new mines the
there is already said that if we in this pace continue the over year would costs to the earth the mines to mean
i like the other institutions than also ask the by the parliament proposed amount on to take although also this inadequate is and the the compliance the the treaty the ottawa to promote also request i the countries the that treaty still not have signed or ratified that be to do
since there already different references the the council are made like i that point that there although not minister present is but that the council here the is represented by few high officials the our comments course will pass
mrs bonino a if time for a report that your commitment really ingratiate is very little but fortunately am i the with the most conclusions in the report agree also with the indirect criticism the the countries the the treaty the ottawa still not confirmed have
my own country has many to long  this to do
there is one problem in the report
to my opinion has the the tendency civil tasks from the cfsp way to let
i think that the sense is any organisation with military activities more civil obligations to give
to my opinion must we the the council the cfsp and the member demands that they addition the ordinary development and humanitarian activities for each amount that the military activities the spent a just large amount the civil activities example  in the on areas to
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues we discuss today a particularly sad subject
we are the there in any case on agree that mines world must be eradicated
i like the subject numbers in three areas seen
the first area is prevention
we are the there in this parliament certainly on agree that existing mines and with particularly mines must be destroyed
if i the the problems and developments in the developing think example in the cuba or in central that from the facts that the as not further can
further seems the i the important that we especially in african countries the sale the the black market prevent
the retrospective is the second area that i important think
we must this a link to with  and special attention give the humanitarian actions
especially research to  and  must be supported
what also not must be neglected is that the european union and the european parliament in the particularly better must can control where the financial resources the we to fact go to
the third area is according i that the the specific measures the must be proposed controlled and carried
i i there the from that we us especially the the victims the mines must up
the is largely to invoked citizens children and soldiers the the last group have we already earlier attention spent
because the here however to children is the be people must there  concern be granted as there now the possibility socalled  treacherous the to measure the in europe
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president with the debate the today on the excellent report the mrs bonino codify we in fact all activities the for the this very serious international problem
only time ago have we on the report the the mr titley voted which in fact the second step was the the the area the the common foreign security and defence this policy will gradually the in very the european union implemented be and specific form adopt with uniform conditions and rules
i think that the developments those right will give the this initiative have taken there will now perhaps last a end to the the picture the  men and women the the addition children without poor and feet let 
policy means here namely prevention and not repression the is also not coincidence that the mines the with particularly in crisis are in areas which the so other initiatives can be taken to the crisis to overcome
there is here a issue touched in the with my country greece
i am that convinced that the greek parliament soon the relevant treaty will ratify if country have we this because already signed
you must however the aware that we this prepared are despite the fact that we a here have turkey the not the good intentions towards us laws
this is unfortunately a fact as also the previous week again agree was demonstrated during the  this were opportunity if a opportunity to a another type demonstration the political stand
let we however hope that in the future also the problems the world from be help
i believe how than also that we with probably large majority in the parliament this report such can strengthen that also those the or prize have to to listen or view to to see forced be here attention the to pay
mr the president gentlemen colleagues i support the report the mr bonino that for a greater transparency and efficiency the and which also the commission development opinion has issued
i thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work
in and during and after the war in bosnia i i the suffering that victims the mines see with own view 
many victims are young children the makes a even impression children to see the even people are and whose life to whose is at still for the really is started
any child that we in bosnia africa or elsewhere for the death or for terrible workplace by mines can shielding is our joint effort worth
i like also the nongovernmental organisations you for their commitment thank
i like still just us amendment the the resolution explain
there there not global consensus on a ban the  the within and outside the nato still always if a essential protection against  and tanks be given
no can however what the the success the ottawa discounts by to say that  this also in had must are
than was the treaty namely already the advance to failure doomed been
what the enlargement the the eu the think i that the countries the treaty the ottawa absolutely must sign
also the usa russia and china must be encouraged the treaty to sign and greece and finland must the as soon possible to ratify
to finally like i say that i the as all mines the the world would want ban because the befitting and loathsome arms are but we life unfortunately not in a heading
mr the president the a  in forgot a young mozambique  the risk he thought that the was disappeared with the peace
this excessive confidence cost him are 
in the two kilometres the a village in bosnia any a plates for the presence the a  despite the there a small lad the
for him is the a  if a another
time if a war the concludes leave populations the camps to back to times to their villages in the hope their crisis to let cure and gradually again a normal life to start
mines have however not message the peace and to their work relentlessly continue
even today still despite the signature the the treaty the ottawa by states continue mines their murderous work continue
to the twenty minutes the there somewhere in the world someone killed or people by a 
certainly there are progress the by the conference the geneva and this positive trend must be stressed because the is the result the a lacks fight the the ngos already very long to
this progress should us however not blind make for the reality because still always be any day people killed and people people by mines
still always have countries together million mines in stocks
last year still were mines used in twenty conflicts with particularly in europe
i welcome therefore the work that is done by my colleagues emma bonino and  morgantini the the parliament again fully involve in the political debate
they give clear the what us still to do the
the my on would i especially the emphasis want to the the universal application the the treaty until the a fully success is in the first place by the laws in the various countries the one line to to with the treaty so the not the another international agreement the that not the applied
there must really pressure be exercised the the countries the the european union the still not signed have as finland or the not ratified have as greece
why would we not sanctions consider mr the commissioner against those the the treaties not failure
why would we not clause into in the framework the the enlargement the new member compulsory the treaty to sign
you has just did the already this questions
i know that on some amendments the opinions still major
however question i you they still agree carefully to look because some the this amendments can by the commission be accepted
how than also we will together our determination show in the fight against the problem the the landmines that a he war must be mentioned
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues war is a cruelty way to the disputes between people the to solve
the is tragic if the civil must suffering under the she the its leaders
the treaty the ottawa on the ban the mines is a very good matter
to many children have the life left or are  become by the the wrong place to play
the programmes the the european union is necessary and i i there behind
the is our duty peoples to help the suffering under long ago made political mistakes
in some countries are more mines in the on than in france  and both are just difficult to find
although i favour am the the end the the abuse the mines like i what finland the few affairs to the to the this the the
finland has the treaty the ottawa not signed and this was here often the out under more by the previous speaker
the criticism is however not bereft the hypocrisy and ignorance
gentlemen colleagues look you agree to finland
the country is report and has a  with russia the more than thousand kilometres
the joint history with our  is for us often embarrassing been
we must us the use to a roman truth the best way the peace to guarantee is to precautions to take for a war
in the finnish defence is for mines a important role play
the can not other countries be occupied and they be only for defence used
all finnish mines are the safe in  and be not to other countries exported
i like emphasise that there very disciplinary that the dealt and all mines can after a conflict easy be from
the must finland not in same category organise if many developing where the imprecise with mines initial and the consequences accordingly are
the must aware that finland large sums spends the the up the mines in other countries
in the practice means that the up the mines with finnish vehicles the help the victims and the destroy the stocks mines
that work is a support the the measures the the european union
finland the are part the the responsibility for the  in the world the the
that must however as done that there not because political pressure the savings the the safety in the own country
welcome
gentlemen present gentlemen colleagues we have today the honour a delegation the moroccan members the the official gallery the us parliament to should welcome the delegation the chaired by the mr rostock  vicepresident the the chamber the members the the kingdom morocco
i is the gentlemen members the i welcome behalf us parliament which their country in the framework the us common project for the creating the a area the prosperity safety and peace in the mediterranean excellent relations its
this will the and november next place in marseilles i am that convinced that your discussions with our delegation for the relations with the  the the chaired by the mr obiols a impetus will give the us project for dialogue and peace
mines continuation
mr the president when a number years ago a beginning made was with the  was said that landmines the  for the poor countries were
there is since only time has but this the the first face what been  judgement can unfortunately still still good service do to a precise picture the the situation to give
there can not there are the progress as there not safe connections are not fields to to  and not places where children without fear can play
therefore has the european union the members the the by the united nations working international campaign they has the a important voice as also already by the previous speakers is indicated
now is the clear become how important the here tabled proposal is the proposal therefore which mrs emma bonino a report has up
we support this proposal and all initiatives the the role the the european union the this area aim to strengthen we stress that we with that objective for view ensure must ensure that the efforts the the european union a greater cohesion to and also finland and greece to cooperation be movers
also must the european union its forces to pool to optimum use to can make the its ability to international pressure from to exercise the already the countries the the still not have members the the treaty the ottawa the european efforts must more be under other by the available to the additional resources
we to to real  to destruction the the existing stocks and development the sophisticated  and  the efforts must more be made by means the coordination and monitoring
nongovernmental organisations must the a important role to play to finally hope we that there in the framework the the tasks the the future european common forces thought the the training the specialists and than especially the people the itself a directly important have the the up the landmines
mr the president the finnish government express the issue mines for the last the june
when was decided to into or finland in part would can take the the treaty the ottawa and latest end are mines would can replace by other methods
get work in international the with others together the the mine
experts from finland and finnish  have year in cambodia a year in mozambique and a year in kosovo the the mine part
finland the the if agreement the the provisions the the in revised  the the convention online   the in december the force is become
finland feels the military not threatened
we have however if only country in the european union a  the more than thousand kilometres with a external power
finland the itself for are credible defence
until a   that approximately the half costs the the finnish defence for a year is when make mines part from the the 
in finland is the not few  in the on
finland has still never mines exported and has they after not more produced
all mines are through
in finland are after the in the years cease  the after the second war not accidents more happened by mines which citizens or soldiers the victims were
finland is a the the unfortunately few countries in the world the international treaties only sign and ratify if they fully in the are the the conditions that to meet
that will also what the mines the done
since i the with almost everything agree am what my colleagues already have said will i not in repeat act i will not use make the my time
that is the best what we now can do to to to vote
i i a resolution accordance article member the the rules received to the debate to the
the debate is closed
the vote take to at place
vote
mr the president gentlemen colleagues we are for a historic vote on a text with a special symbolic gentlemen namely the european constitution
however would the unfortunately are if we a report in vote would to that  is with been and legal 
that would a smet are the the history
therefore i i for mr the president that this text the back to the commission for a  so this historic vote not the upstanding by  
there is with respect the the rules a proposal tabled to committee the the report to the commission
i like now like listen to a speaker for and a speaker against if the there are otherwise put i the proposal the the mr martinez in vote
mr the president i believe that if we the on a smet have the contribution the the mr martinez of the best example is
extremely right is indeed a smet the the creating the a european democracy while the european constitution precisely a constructive step is in the direction the the european democracy
the parliament rejected the request to committee to the commission
after the vote on amendment
mr the president we have a small problem in the with the text
we have just a correction made in paragraph
but by this small  have we a important element from the view lost that from the beginning a demand is been the the european parliament
because what also our opinion is on the constitutionalisation or we now for or against a constitution are we are the there all on agree that the assent the the parliament requires is
this element that in the original paragraph the was included have we the the  on the head given
therefore with the approval the the rapporteur olivier duhamel i i for that we this add the paragraph last line the than if follows would task from the in the to the the discussion to the adoption after assent the the parliament the the final text the the constitution
we would therefore five words add
this addition would in agreement are with all debates and votes the the parliament on this subject has taken
are there any against the addition the the six words the the mr onesta has read
not any
good than put i this amendment now in vote
mr the president this is not oral amendment the amendment
the is a oral amendment the the original text
you said just amendment that is least what i i heard in the translation
this is the not to
the is to a oral amendment that a direct amendment the the text the
mr duhamel the oral amendment is the not only objection the the on the this house encountered therefore is the adopted
the parliament the the resolution the
report a the the mr gilrobles gildelgado behalf the commission constitutional affairs on the reinforced cooperation ini
the parliament the the resolution the
resolution b on the status the the islands
the parliament the the resolution the

the parliament the the resolution the

the parliament the the resolution the
report a the the mr bowis behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the paper on food com c cos
mr the president i i a oral amendment for the amendment the words close links have for some a what rejecting covert
therefore i i for the to change in close contacts i i with the liberal group agreed that they in that case its amendment will withdraw
the parliament the the resolution the
 a
mr the president the is i a large pleased you that to can parts that i for the report the mrs bonino i voted this report is a commendable contribution to the prevent the the damage the that terrible arms in more caused
i wanted here however still the add that us parliament the also must interest for the question who as need already the misery must cause not only with mines but with already the arms where the humanity the the him
i believe that the responsibility this sought must be in the  man the the state and government the very what countries in the world and in the  man the many to many citizens the think that they their conflicts the just with a  war can resolve
let we hope that this a end the is
mr the president our group has before this report voted
this is a very important matter and we find that the european parliament the a  role has played a role the the large important is been the the campaign against the mines
the ngos have a fundamental role played
they have long time the the acceptance the the ban despite the fact that some governments very reluctant were and claimed that the unrealistic would are
but where a like is is a way and than can there many achieved be
the governments must the role take and forced be to the treaty to sign
they must that insist that countries the treaty also sign
all in the world see you that long after wars last are people still still suffering because they the victims be the landmines what unacceptable is
innocent citizens women and men and especially children be people and killed by a weapon that there still was long after the war was last
the idea that industries profits make with such inhumane materials is absolutely unacceptable
earlier was there someone the spoke on the other arms the be produced
we must the production the all arms in look take not only the landmines especially within the european union let we first the hand in own house to
the is not acceptable or ethical responsible that we jobs provide or profits make with materials the people deaths scourge and sign
we must the find to to alternatives
the idea that there technology knowledge and money the spent the the make the arms the people and the  destroy is unacceptable
the step the is taken with the landmines shows the that progress possible is to a humane society the not benefit going from death and destruction
the danish social vote for the report on the fight the mines
the commission has in its communication report issued on the actions the the union already has taken the fight the the use the mines
denmark has the different occasions part the humanitarian mine which only citizens and not military involved were
this was not in fight with the danish reservations the military area
the actions were with resources from different lines financed
the commission the now for they future through one horizontal line to finance
the parliament supports this proposal because the current structure with the many different lines not transparent is and not conducive is for a coordinated fight
the is still unclear what legal the commission for this initiative will proposals
the is therefore the this at difficult to say or the initiative  will are with the danish reservations
the would however annoying are that denmark the not can participate the a project that intended is to the dreaded and inhumane mines in the next or year the to abolish
and i support the i the decision the the parliament to active measures to take against mines
the eu has the obligation a position in to take against arms the intended are for people the not participate the the fight and which the victims in large extent under the civil the
also makes the to the large quantities landmines on large areas the impossible to food to grow during many years after the conflict already is concludes
although we the general objective the the report support are we the not agree with all proposed resources to this objective to achieve
we find the a problem that the cfsp the redundancies the responsibility for civil actions
the peace and security would moreover a more policy can are if the the secure and the national resources for military actions a just large amount for humanitarian actions would be placed
finland objective to in to to act to the treaty the ottawa and the mines end to have replace by other 
finland has never mines exported
finland has only for are own defence mines produced and through
the finnish defence properly traditionally to the lowest in europe
the decision to the to see the mines the enormous demands the the finnish defence
mines are the weapon the the defender
or can someone tell how the with mines can attacks
in the finnish  play mines a important role
the is the plan to for in the framework the a new  decisions to take on a  programme
then must the financial issues replacement systems and methods and the effect the the decisions the the development the the  be examined
finland remains participate the both the objective the a total ban if the the international cooperation the the area the mine
if small country have we that the the propose been in the fight against the use the landmines
europe the the the propose the the  and 
therefore also i i the  approved
in the particularly like i however the attention questions for a the the area adapted technology for the detection the mines
a the hundred the the  the because itself early or late victims the are activity also the result the  
the use the  as  dogs and rats that in the practice particularly good results the to make
however be the financial resources especially used to  military  to develop
report lancker a
mr the president if member the the group the the european party but especially also if member the the party the the pensioners can i not otherwise than for the report the mrs the lancker vote also already are few amendments the i in the commission had tabled there not  i i that especially because under point g the wish the expressed and the commission the parliament and the council be this with so words invited to a minimum for all citizens the the european union good to approve
we debate in this parliament on  on the length the car programmes and as but we have still not by how important the is that there in all fifteen member a common regulation is for a humanitarian pension for everyone
therefore i i motion
the report lancker brings few general principles in remind as the right the pension or a minimum and the strike principles where the text the the council the if only clamouring has not agree on talk
for the other the the parliament by the rapporteur asked the socalled social policy that the commission the council has proposed good to approve this would mean that the parliament are signature would to under a owes because there the in this proposal not few specific measure the the situation the the workers can improve
nothing compulsory the large companies for employment to ensure and they can even continue with jobs to delete while they enormous profits make
the leaders the the european union invite the social partners from to a active role to play in sectors the the employment the under their responsibility the but that is quite cynical
if employers and workers the footing the equality are if the is to the recruitment the staff
the is simply a way to unemployed least partially responsible to to for their unemployment
therefore although we voted have for the in remind to the the fundamental social rights have we by us the vote to abstained the social policy in are whole rejected because this policy lowest matter makes with the their practices the the  the all in europe people people salaries reduce jobs and incomes the the put to and the social protection weaken
i would my appreciation want express for the work that is done in the framework the the preparation the the social agenda the the french presidency and the martine martine both what the content if the form the and therefore also mrs the lancker the i want congratulate
this agenda is a initiative the the french presidency and provides in a genuine programme for the next five year
he is in the line the the main conclusions the the european council the lisbon to know the creating the a competitive economy and the objective the full employment
the agenda is the in consultation with the european institutions and the ngos the fully the the the the the agenda are involved
in the report lancker are also some the the proposals included the experts and representatives the the civil have done the opportunity the the conference the the european commission and the parliament joint have organised the this issue the and september
this agenda is therefore a strong political signal for the european citizens the find that europe the to very limited to the creating the a large single
in the agenda the the emphasis the the the important and the reality the the european social model but also the the need to modernisation of
we should the citizens not disappoint
the social agenda must therefore support the the fixed conviction that the social economic and employment closely with other out and between on are and that the is to equal policies the together the triangle forms the the community policy the promotion the the social quality the all citizens
the social policy must indeed a full complexes are with own objectives
the must not purely if a consequently be given the the economic and employment or the the creating the the internal market and certainly not if the last  the a know barrel
during the next five year will we us must concentrate the the create the quality the the anticipate and in good jobs lead the the transition to a new social environment the the use the the opportunities the the economy the the modernisation and improvement the the social protection the the promotion the social integration and equality between men and women the the strengthening the the fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination
i am pleased on the adoption in nice the this agenda the together with the charter the the fundamental late see that we us the a point are in the construction the europe from now will this at are the the strengthening the the social and civil dimension the the union
the european union the if political and economic body still more
economic results forms however not the only criterion for the assessment the the legislators the the european union
the is the task the us all ensure to ensure that the main social problems within our community be resolved and with inertia be tackled
with the view this am the i that the european commission its approval has granted the the decides for the employment the the irish government for the period the seven year the
this is a honest and balanced social programme and is a the the essential parts the the national development the the irish government for the period the seven year from
this programme the ensure that people the not training have and not schools have learnt however opportunities be is
there the especially the emphasis the the the up the programmes the aid offer the longterm unemployed and our schoolleavers
this plan mature also the need the opportunities to further for people the currently a jobs have what also in the agenda for the social policy for the the eu the mentioned
the agenda for the social policy the the eu mature that opportunities for further the the existing population must be is the technological area and for internet
the technology change such quickly that the population the the european union must have on the necessary  if the european union competitive like can continue
flexibility the the population and the promote the  properly also to the main objectives the the irish government for the next seven year
to this policy a success to let are the national level and within the wider context the the european union is the a necessary that lower agencies a policy to for the development the the entrepreneurship in europe
this report means a important step in the direction the a europe where employment and social policy central are
the supports the the conclusions the the summit the lisbon and objective to the achieve the a agreement in nice on the creating the a european social agenda the the next five year the basis will forms the the european social policy
the report the a general and coherent look the what a really social policy would can are by the economic social and employment the other to link
the used all instruments which the european union now has the social charter the chapter on employment article if legal for the fight against all forms the discrimination etc
our rapporteur vote in with the proposals the the european commission but deficiencies they the with the demand to more european legislation the social area
the role the and the dialogue with the involved social partners the the creating the legislation be strengthened
for the case however that there not agreement the achieved calls our commission the european commission the its initiative to use and appropriate legislative to do
where the the comes is that we still more recover in the direction the a social europe therefore the more social european legislation
for the other request the rapporteur us the member to support in their attempts a minimum in to to and the right to give the a minimum that any citizens in the the a dignified life to lead
i can you only but urge this report to support as the charter the the fundamental the the for our common values
the report deals a agenda for the social policy for the next five year
the the a series proposals for improvements the the social conditions and the the conditions for workers what we the i support
we appreciate the wordings the the rapporteur on the open method the the autonomy the the member in social issues respects and based is the voluntary harmonisation and coordination
we make us however ensure on the fact that the report same proposals contains the that going that the commission the driving the behind the development the the social policy in europe what also the this area a increasing supranationalism to result has
to the legislation the the area the the social and policy good to let function must they the point forms in a change that the the below development and which the different conditions and experience in europe reflected be
i declare the that i against the report the mrs the lancker i voted
in the plenary sitting the the european parliament see we rarely such  reports if that the mrs the lancker on the agenda for the social policy the the european union
in its  like mrs the lancker all measures achieve the the citizens have want stop i repeat stop by the the previous elections the the european parliament a  majority to choose
i can there only the  if the commission this just adopted fully unrealistic almost silly criteria really is support
more conflict between the proposals the the parliament and the objectives the lisbon is not possible
the mainly socialist european government rights this to the most that they the objective had the the europe the most dynamic and competitive economy the world to make
if the proposals the the lancker be accepted to we a  back in the time where the is to our opportunities the important ambitious and necessary objectives the lisbon to achieve
what like mrs the lancker fact
according its must the working in europe considerably be reduced must the social legislation the the european union considerably be extended must the level the the social security in europe enormous be increased must the power the the trade be increase and supranational  possible be made must organisations wider powers to to heard to be must the social policy the priority have in all economic sectors the competition and the public
i can the colleagues only but remind the the way words the   merkel in the political is more social feeling need but that is not same if socialism
i can not resist the the temptation to terms to use or would said  the not would just in your report and the to your persistent  the the area the employment and social protection the the denounce to to
will you still always as  do on the society the were all problems will solve when everyone including babies chronic patients and uneducated has on a own curtailment but the not can consult the lack the resources to a computer to buy
in your eeurope will the there moreover the for ensure that this material the everyone the made when the computers more to the users will look than the users to the computers and when computers the reports will write
your lyrical produce are however less pleasing when the aware that they not the welfare the the europeans aim but still more laws directives and regulations from brussels
your view on open cooperation means that the again ends in a institutional structure the governed the by the officials the the commission
the only that really open is  even is the possibility to the influence the brussels to in the indefinitely from to extend without that the the treaties not to review
the powers the you brussels you give are the way and settingup the minimum social protection flexibility the the work therefore exploitation the the worker compulsory reduction the the working what means that salaries be frozen and companies less ability have absolute control on the social dialogue as martine has in france
therefore will we us abstained the vote on this report because although we pleased are on the in the report congratulates concern on the employment how artificial and cumbersome the also is can we the specific proposals in the report really not approve
we have against the report lancker voted on a agenda for the social policy
the proposal the the commission for a new social agenda is a good document
the commission has a number areas defined which cooperation and coordination between the eu important are
the commission the in the new political agenda a framework for which all important operators a role can play and which the differences between the national systems be respected
the commission will its initiative use and the member support the the to the to the the necessary changes
rapporteur the lancker like that the parliament decision to amendment the the proposal the the commission one by a number areas to to add which legislation the application is and hand by a number rights the european level the to to
mrs the lancker is the opinion that binding instruments the many greater scale used must be
the commission will not obstacles be to its initiative to use the the areas which they the competence has to to act and binding instruments for to to
we have a very positive  the relation the the european union
if swedish liberals see we the european integration if a possibility to solutions to find for crossborder problems as environment trade free movement on the borders human and conflict
the this areas to the european democracies the opportunity to the world to let see that cooperation lead to peace and more prosperity
we believe also in the subsidiarity a decision must the the lowest possible level be taken
therefore to we us active in for a constitution for the european union the the distribution the the burden for a any clear makes
the must for all citizens completely clear are that the eu the only will deal with the issues the they the best can regulate to know the crossborder issues
all other issues must the local regional or national level dealt be
the proposal the the commission on a agenda for the social policy is us i line with our look the the function the the eu
a european cooperation the lead to coordination and more prosperity is the right inevitable
the european social systems are as diverse that a binding legislation not the right result will that
we support therefore the proposal the the commission and vote against the report lancker on a agenda for the social policy
workers find the often difficult the with europe to identify
although the european internal market the global given dynamic development and the convergence within the economic and monetary union still more process is the social union usually the fifth wheel the the plunge
this while the union since the summit the amsterdam in on new instruments has to the social policy better to develop
since lisbon in march objective the council also not only to a higher growth and more qualified jobs but also to a greater social cohesion
the commission strengthened by the third social action the aware that economic policy employment and social policy more with other must be cohesion
a proof the this syllabuses is in the employability the people to the leap the a industrial society to a society to can make have people and not only young more knowledge and skills need
there must in the member therefore more in training and education multilingualism mobility and communication be invested
many the what in the report lancker the called is unacceptable
as would the process the luxembourg that the has the the employment also the the area the the social protection and social exclusion must be applied
this process the in that annual common objectives be the and national action be carried the than also annual also by the european parliament be evaluated this is such successful method because there new qualitative and quantitative objectives be formulated while the subsidiarity consistent in eight the taken
the method can not just the other areas be applied because a specific approach necessary is
our group wishes not right the a minimum or a basic to recognise
nor accept we the again set demand that the legal working the european level must be limited
the practice in many european companies shows that flexibility the the working many better working
also the demand that there a legal for ngos must to to a civil dialogue to regulate is for us not acceptable
the rapporteur is as  the centralist solutions that they the subsidiarity has let support
because the most amendments the the group however just by a considerable majority are adopted i i for the report voted
the  has before the report lancker voted because this report on the european social agenda many good points contains this text has not legal status but must the information for the summit the nice and the programme the the commission
there be however various areas under the attention the which new legislative measures be proposed
some have the the tasks the the best the the level the the member can be tackled or premature are in the sense that the legislation still but recently is approved and still not fully is implemented and evaluated
the a number points paragraph a b and c could the  not support express the the call to tax and legal measures and directives to abovementioned mentioned reasons
the  has the abstained the vote on the strike
according the  is this already regulated in the legislation the the member and down in the charter the the fundamental
the  could not support express the the call to a legal regulation the  in the framework the the statute the the european company since committing relations already in other legislation the regulated
finally is the  the opinion that the new directives the fight the discrimination under article still not enough the opportunity have been to their the to do apply
to the reason has the  against the proposals for new vertical directives voted because further legislation premature would are
meeting the the informal european council the biarritz
mr the president the council has us during the debate the yesterday again greatest the the in biarritz reached rapprochement between the positions the the national governments on the enlargement the votes with qualified majority
this statement concern us ensure and i would here under other two issues want address the us particularly deal
the first has the commission proposed the international  on services and intellectual property to misguided this like say in the council to deal with qualified majority without ratification by the national parliaments this possibility is moreover created by the in amsterdam introduced article member the the treaty
this transfer the powers seems us very dangerous because this would the national parliaments each right lose to control from to exercise the future negotiations the the wto on this for our companies essential issues
that is however not the worst
the commission like also the negotiations on investment misguided
if this proposal the accepted can we there certainly the are that within the next six months the commission us a other version will impose the the multilateral agreement on investment the famous mai the two year ago not could be rejected only and only because they was under strictly intergovernmental procedures
therefore agree to more prevents the commission the national democracies the disgraceful way the their rights without therefore our powers to strengthen already that they course the opposite
a second category decisions which the any transition to the regime the the qualified majority us ensure concern the the immigration and the international movement accordance article the the treaty must decisions on this policies during five year after the force the the treaty the amsterdam with unanimity the vote be taken but can then possibly under qualified majority to to the
the commission like that this changing now already place
that point we resolutely the
in this issue has the experience us learnt that with any transfer the powers to the commission the inaction the the policy increasing when powers other the the national authorities continue has this relatively given a positive effect the the security
we choose for safety
addition the legal  the here and this are increased has the summit the biarritz especially let see that the enlargement the europe little more is than a difficult cattle
the powerful countries as germany france and britain and in lesser extent italy are there all the from to the small eastern and southern countries the want join to the european union to issues the their power
any country trying however are own influence and the interests the are own industrial and financial groups safe to to
what us to wait the is not agree a union with two speeds but a stake where the large  the the european economy the will landfill the a number less developed countries the outside the union already if prevent reach but also within the eu a easy prevent will are
what the charter the the fundamental the presented the signature that by the met state and government only if 
the text remains vague on the basic human the social rights the free movement the nationals the third countries
he is only clear on the property and the freedom the take the only the smallholders the capital into
we are absolutely not the plan our approval to attach the the conclusions the the summit the biarritz or the what the will decisions the the next summit the nice
mr the president i i i the the vote on the resolution on the results the the informal european council the biarritz the vote abstained and the to two reasons the first i i on the paragraphs and a rollcall voice can produce
i am the there nor that agree that the charter the the fundamental in the treaty included the that would namely a first step are in the direction the the constitutionalisation the same charter and than to we the direction from the a federation
i label also the general application the the vote the qualified majority the if you this measure from see the the other here  measures see you that this the serious national interests conflicts can that
this measure goes also in against already what in paragraph the the resolution expressly to the the the that is same paragraph therefore the i in the opportunity has the i the vote to abstained
if i not against voice is that because i my support like express for each possible initiative that a end can make the the odds relationship between the small and large countries the debate on the institutional reform has namely led to a type 
the french presidency is the unfortunately one the the main kind been in paragraph the rightly out the the fundamental important the working and for all member acceptable solutions independent the their extent or economic weight
we are europeans and that want we continue but only if the underlying principle the free and sovereign states respected the
we vote for the resolution but we want a few comments places the the next points
the charter the the fundamental must the nature have the a political statement the the the summit the nice the made
the apply the unanimity the vote in the decisionmaking must not only apply the issues the constitutional nature but also the issues the the fundamental important are for the member
we have us within the party the beginning the the favour the a charter the the fundamental with a binding nature shown
we find the however the legal grounds wrong this in article the the treaty now already to to refer the convention can by are nature not formally decision on the charter take that the legal given still not there
more to  is the demand that the charter in the treaties must be included
further have the national parliaments the still not on the charter can express while this the the by the member ratified echr the the case was
we have only to this reasons not the both parts the paragraph the the resolution accepted
i i for the resolution voted because the parliament the in this resolution she marketing against the imperialist vision the a europe the large and  countries a europe where the other countries the not can do apply
the resolution limited the to a call to a the the healthy sense  balance to achieve a balance that are roots has in the history the the community
there are there the the status the the parliament wanted reduce to a  the the indeed  intentions the the  countries the suffering now a defeat
with exception the the charter the the fundamental that in a clarifies europe where on two decades the number people the the fourth age the million will exceed not few provision contains on the right the closer economic social and human protection has the summit the biarritz the especially concentrated the the drastic reduction the  which the equalisation the application is while this the only procedure is the the interests the the peoples respects also has he the focused the the unfortunate invention the closer cooperation also know under names if the europe the the élites the engines the where the variable geometry or the europe or la à
what is there between in paris and in amsterdam with if its rome in happened
europe is created by treaties between equal states
also is europe more than a legal construction the is a large family the the linked feels by same civilisation a common house
well the idea the closer cooperation means that the essential areas if monetary policy defence or taxation certain members the the family more rights and duties have than other
with other words the the table the the common european house would families are which some or la à eat and others peace must take with the smallest menu
some would should speak on the monetary policy while others as denmark and sweden must silent
as there in the period for the introduction the the universal vote a distinction was between active and passive citizens would there now active and passive peoples are
the would than the the one on the the table the  have the on war taxes and monetary policy should talk and the the other on as in france for the  the not clamouring have
in the europe the the variable geometry is also the number   in the council different to according the the subject the european machinery that now already little transparent is will this only but  be
closer cooperation is with other words a slammed way to the equalisation and the veto the the guardians are the the national interests in the their to were and the the principle the the equality between the states to violate peoples the a minority forms from to the a gap to create between the member and this remarkably enough by the democratic basis the the european construction to strengthen the certain the the european institutions to increase and confusion as not chaos to cause in the council and the commission
agree to more is behind the screen the technocratic concepts a know delay find the like the peoples the europe a military and tax europe impose that they not wish and they the right deprive to no to say against the  the their national freedoms
the vote on this report the the opposition again the the  against the into the the charter the the fundamental in the treaty and the part the the report which the unanimity the the council the limited to constitutional affairs
the  has the into the the charter the the fundamental consistent not supported because this rights already in the national legislation be regulated and in the european treaty for the rights the the human
the into the a new text in the treaties will to all probably legal confusion create
the reduction the unanimity in the council to constitutional affairs would essential affairs if taxation and social security out the to our opinion under the responsibility the the member must continue
the resolution contains good parts on the federal republic yugoslavia and the east and the  supports than also in large lines the resolution
the summits the state and government give number high expectations
the summit the biarritz was presented if having the at the is for drafting the the fundamental the all possible rights also the rights the we never itself had dare think if the european community and the countries the this part the of to the date in a entire chaos lived
and however have we not really the impression that our countries the  the the world are where the to attention for the human is
course can the always still better the democratic control must never elections we find however not that a list the the rights and inclusion of in the treaties the main  the the european union must are
even the state and government are there fact not in managed to the on this issue agree to be hence that in the next summit the nice the premises again arrested will be
the first must a economic policy be down to the euro from the much to to and the employment again the to can the second must the investment in the union attract to the economy again smooth to draw
the fourth must the a common policy outlining for consistently diplomatic action the defence the the peace in the east and i as but by this are all extremely important and urgent issues for the future the the union and for the role the they in the world would must role
as however as often happening with this summits is behind the convention  a many  truth find the fifteen are not in the has the a common policy the to measure
a european council the this problems know the to tackle will last the usefulness the are own institution know the to show and the citizens the the union a signal the confidence and hope give
duhamel a
mr the president we have voted against the duhamel on the european constitution because the according the good old method the monnet a political revolution seeks to achieve under the considerations the technical considerations without also but a time clear to say that this in fact a end the made the a europe which the national constitutions the seas law are for the peoples
in the explanatory says the rapporteur here something more on and the he that the treaty already in high extent a supranational nature has he based the the especially the the interpretations the the court the justice
but to our opinion are the interpretations the this fifteen judges the the not the the the treaties as they are ratified clear wrong and must they still always the approval to the the peoples the the member the the according us this must can express
the rapporteur shows the moreover a has the the new theory the in brussels in the fashionable is the socalled double legitimacy the the european union the the the citizens represented by the european parliament and the the the states represented by the council
this theory does not with the treaty that only one legitimacy recognises namely the i quote the the peoples the the states the in the community are united
this is the formula the articles and the the treaty the means that the community only the states unites the the their turn each their own people represent
in not case represent the european members the european citizens in the general
they represent their own citizens and the the basis work they together in the framework the the european control the the states the control has however a additional nature because the main control based the the national parliaments
otherwise said the fact that the european members their respective peoples represent change nothing the the nature the the community
the means no that a imaginary european citizens the placed over the national citizens and still less that a do european democracy over the national democracies is to are or even agree right would are
mr the president i i absolutely positive the the report the the mr duhamel
i am that convinced that the elderly and pensioners find that europe a future the peace to offer has and therefore are we for hundred cent behind any step how small also the in the direction is
the party the the pensioners can fact not otherwise than the behind europe already since the the only party is the only in the european parliament footing and not in the parliaments the the national states represented is
i i the fully right to myself to country if the only representative the a party the only in the european parliament footing
who is  than carlo fatuzzo
this is a  position that to my feeling  the the what we pensioners argue a really united europe
mr the president i i against the report duhamel voted because i think that this report not the right approach represents
i am the agree with what the mr berthu has said that the concept the one few the with one few constitution the national sovereignty the the member fully undermining
this project is the the man the the basis the the idea the a constitution for the people this is course all good and well but if there but one constituency there watered the the individual power the the people in the member
there is about on referenda and on the amendments the this report with the to referenda
referenda are the large important but if you in a only constituency almost any jumping in a member would ignore than is that not more democratic
the is interesting to see that people the idea the a referendum the this way to the to because if you the changes as the in the during the years have place in the treaties the european act the treaty the maastricht and the treaty the amsterdam see you that but very little citizens in the individual member participation have had and if result of know we not what the civil in the member like
the recently taken referendum in denmark on the euro late see that there many people are the if they this the opportunity to other statements do than the in the parliament be done only to they the opportunity not is
mr the president the the vote on the committee the the duhamel i i i from protest the vote abstained
know you i am a enough movement the right in this parliament
the has i however embarrassing affected that in same parliament a representative the the left parties i know not agree more who the was elected members that can  that they this parliament disgrace without that you they to the item calls mr the president
a such can should we not accept because extreme forces exactly such language evaluate when they for my birth and in my early youth in my country the the power were
we should a such language the no accept or the right or the leftwing
the swedish and danish social vote against the duhamel on the constitutionalisation the the treaties
the report the if condition that the treaties a fundamental part include that the common estimating if protocols the the treaty be adopted and that there different procedures are for the adaptation the the different texts
we find that the cooperation also in the future based must are the unanimity on fundamental issues on the legal which the eu supports
therefore can we not for the report vote
with the the that the treaties in their current form to wish leave the the area the transparency and so can we agree
we are therefore favour the a revision the the texts with the intention the objectives and instruments for the construction the the eu the a apportioning and intelligible way for to to
unfortunately is the commission constitutional affairs completely simply the the events in the european union the last years
during the elections for the european parliament in was the turnout only apart the the countries the  have and the countries which the national elections  with the elections for the european parliament
as little enthusiasm was there for the federalist project in
in september has the danish population against the  voted and i know certainly that the citizens the other member also against the project voted would have if they this the opportunity had been
the is interesting to the to see that the danish social the the  last month were to welcome when the result the the vote from the higher circles know was and disappointed were when they danger how the workers had voted
this would a political signal must are for the failure the the development the the eu
despite this setbacks for the training the a federal state has the commission constitutional affairs still a report made for a constitution for the eu while the citizens this at not the are to wait
what we other need have is a clearer definition the the specifically in the european union
now is this principle only a mechanism for the eu if such because today the day the eu the decided the what level the political decisions taken be with if result that the eu the one policy after the other to the soaks
also there there need the a simplification the the rules for flexibility so they in higher extent a european cooperation possible make in agreement with the wish the the european population
also must the areas which the european union nothing to make has carefully set to be that are the areas which the member independent decisions can take
the socialist portuguese members have for the duhamel on the constitutionalisation the the treaties voted the texts the the force the the european union set are almost illegible become by the accumulation the the result is the the other  treaties
the is the fundamental important that the european union the direction the a constitution direction which than also the charter the the fundamental the included
the democracy in the european union can not otherwise than might are with a clear clear and readable constitution a constitution the for the citizens if reference service can do
the portuguese socialist meps are not behind the idea that this constitution necessarily through a referendum ratified must be
from that position must moreover not secondary be that we the referendum if instrument reject or that the portuguese people on a deepening the the european union not consulted would need to be
the choice for a constitution must free and autonomous place and must therefore not subordinate be made the a rule the contrary would can are with the constitutional  the the member
to the reason have the socialist portuguese members against the proposal the their own group voted that pointed because in the direction the a  referendum in all member the the european union
if we this objective a european constitution want achieve do we there sensible the not rigid forms and methods the to to since the only but to a failure can lead
the this type delicate affairs must we just foolhardy if careful to work to
i support the approach and the report the olivier duhamel both terms form if content
if convinced european and if  the the european movement north and citizens the europe am i for a federal europe because i favour am the a political social civil europe that both democratic if efficient is
the a at that our european union seems way to sinking in the growing nationalism and threatened the by less or more  forms the fascism is there need the a new impetus
olivier duhamel and are report make this a excellent contribution
i i therefore with conviction and enthusiasm for are report voted
despite my appreciation for the work the olivier duhamel i i i the the final abstained because the debate on a european constitution according i to early is
although such constitution the the desirable is will the adoption that only possible are after a indepth institutional reform
a constitution has only sense when the the democratic basis is the a real european federation the united states the europe
as the eu a collation remains the national states the only the limited scale solidarity are with a budget the maximum the the gross domestic product the europe is will any attempt to constitutionalisation the the existing treaties only a flight to the are a flight the unknown political area
we reject this report in name the the democratic europe that we want build
by the the drafting the the european constitution same resources and objectives to use if for the charter the the fundamental cover the union in the forces the a european construction that not made is for the peoples or by the peoples or they now from the member or from the countries to
the is not made for the peoples because there the with not floor reference on the social content the europe
to the example the the charter that broad attention satisfactory the the freedom the take and the right the property but not protection offers the million poor and million unemployed talk the now on the political strengthening the the liberal europe the maastricht
a real social constitution would the from the most social acquis impose the for the the workers the women the immigrants and the citizens
the is not made by the peoples because despite a few hypocritical references to any referenda will again a few institutional delegations decide on the fate the million people
a general european congress the representatives the the social movement would the ideal platform are been to to to to a really charter the the rights the the peoples and the workers
everything is at the a  debate between federalists and those the sovereignty
the fact that social issues not the mentioned to working this only but in the hand
we reject this wrong choice and demands with the social movement a another charter for a another europe
the vote on this report in the commission constitutional affairs with vote for and against the votes late see that there the this area a gap there between the members the the parliament
this report the the mr duhamel is under the category the reports the better not written had can be especially not the this at
because given the current situation in the different member danger the earlier a counterproductive the to have the this at is our main priority because not a length debate on a european constitution but the the creating the a treaty that the european union allow the enlargement to processing without the community method in risk to to the the key is to the success the the european integration
in this debate on the choice between a constitution or a treaty i i earlier the the on the jacques delors than the the mr duhamel and those the there together with him for have taken that this report was presented the the parliament
jacques delors has there scarcely a month ago still the opportunity the a sitting the our commission constitutional affairs rightly the out that the term constitution very ambiguous is
delors said that according him the parliament supported by a large part the the political classes there the prefer the would give our relations with other countries to regulate by a international treaty
in this framework i quote again jacques delors would we the certain areas a common exercise the sovereignty can accept
a constitution is very what otherwise
the refers to a concern
by a constitution in to to would the member the really the a very dangerous way the even would can lead to a constitutional court that the nations little the little would robbing the the infinitum the they want continue exercise
a good treaty is more worth than a treaty that the name constitution would to end quote the jacques delors
because i the at agree am with this sensible words the jacques delors i i not voted for the report the the mr duhamel
the to to strengthening clarification and deepening the the european union is certainly valuable and same applies for the expect to the texts to simplify order the force that for the citizens more to make nevertheless i i not before voted
the is there for i briefly and good the the that the resolution a type pandora the pandora is from the text that no clear why a european constitution urgent or even but desirable is
a constitution for europe as the the time and were the a quite contradictory way the defended can contribute to additional civilisation the the union with the focus the democracy and citizenship the can also a instrument are for the exactly defining the powers a type  which formally for agree and for always the down what the specific and special powers the the union and its institutions are
the constitutionalisation the the treaties can also progress for the union mean and a strengthening the its political powers content same constitutionalisation can however also going the a  formalising the the subsidiarity
the is than also significant that many members and even prime blair a favour want break for a european constitution
he has this report in are express european importance want interpret without concessions to do the already to simple solutions if referenda the a large risk represent and in many member not few tradition know already with already is are speech not more than a clear interpretation the a europe that built is the history and convictions
therefore is the precisely as woefully that the text not with the the fails and ideas the the first european under the portuguese
for that difference is only the rapporteur responsible he is not sufficient clear and exactly been
i would even against can vote that is however the a very radical way to a believe on a text to judgement and as important is the text now also not
i consider the report the the mr duhamel if a interesting and constructive contribution the the idea the constitutionalisation the the treaties
you would can say that the existing treaties in essence the european constitution forms but this are difficult to read and the articles that are not always in a logical order
a future constitution would the clear and relatively concise way the next can set
the fundamental the the european citizens
the principle the the separation the powers and the the rule
the composition the role and the function the the institutions the the union
the distribution the the powers and responsibilities
the subsidiarity
the role the the european political parties
the purposes the the european integration
this report contains both a positive if a negative on
rightly the noted that there in the during the years a  accumulation the long and complex treaties is the and that the good would are if the be reconsidered to one briefly and accessible treaty that for everyone clear makes what there to now to is agreed
time the a favour taken for a european constitution the both this treaty if the charter the the fundamental would must include while also the role the european political parties would must be down
despite the recognition that the national identity the the member must be respect and that the national citizenship not must be abolished inclines this report very strong in the direction the a centralised european superstate to the model the the united
i support like a enlargement the the social fundamental and a for all inhabitants the europe readily and accessible structure the political decisionmaking
a editorial thorough the the existing treaties and the by the eu sign the the already long existing european treaty for the rights the the human the the council the europe is this sufficient
the british labour the the group welcome this report without all details that to support
we think that a new planning and simplification the the treaties the citizens a more insight will give in the responsibilities the the eu and in its restrictions as in the procedures for the exercise the this responsibilities
we find the a good idea that future changes after nice prepared would can be by a convention made from the national parliaments the european parliament and representatives to the model the the convention the the draft the the fundamental with success has up
the ratification must however left be the any member accordance are own procedures and traditions
we want not the advance already determine what affairs in this new constitution must be included and or example the charter there the or not part the must of
we have already on a constitution in the form the treaties with this office that the the powers the the union its procedures and the composition the the powers the its institutions are anchored
this are however not should they are obscure and meet not if the is to efficiency and democracy
we are welcome with attempts the the improvement want make
i i i the the final abstained the vote
the is for i the crucial important that the charter the the fundamental in the eu a accession to the treaty the the european council on the human means
the floor constitution is political given wrong and gives the wrong association
the right term must other are summarise and simplification the the eu
the swedish christian are the opinion that the convention for the the the the charter the the fundamental not democratic and good functioning  is has
this applies for both the monitoring the the national parliaments and their constitutional committees if for the commission constitutional affairs the the european parliament
in the practice has the presidency the the convention a own summarise made the what the think that the different participants have achieved
if the convention in the future be used than must its task limited continue to the function the 
i i with enthusiasm voted for the report the our mr olivier duhamel because the one to the large ideas and projects the step for step the foundations have the for the european construction after the war
what this idea however particularly makes is that the based the the parliament a institution the any day a little more the authority the the peoples late apply within the union and within its institutional triangle
little the little treaty after treaty and to we hope will that the nice this not favour the do the the old european nationalism transcended and forms the european countries together a global in a world the governed the by 
we know all that europe with are diplomacy currency safety culture and social model only the  history but also the has mutual conflicts the the european peoples can survive if the ratify in a federation the nations the has on strong do good organised and cooperating institutions the anchored are in a european constitution what our mr duhamel the the has given
to the treaty the amsterdam the was europe a intergovernmental 
with the treaty the amsterdam and the enlargement the the codecision has the european parliament europe really the way let approach the the political integration and the supranationalism
if the union tomorrow very europe like can include the whole european continent therefore even over the next enlargement will the institutions need have the on sufficient political and democratic maturity have
the year that some to boring find will the history like if the year which the idea the a european constitution is developed and confirmed by a majority the this parliament that today the the point the to the duhamel the to take
therefore must we also much hope that the summit the nice and the intergovernmental conference a success be simply so the affairs quickly forward can to
report a
mr the president since i elected am to european member is i to  on a question which i sometimes whole nights not view  will i the save to still before my mandate the end the my play the to to to a european legislation on pension
to now to manage the i not because the pension not under our powers is
but the report the the mr gilrobles inadequate i now the to aid because the proposed the that certain member the the union for certain issues and areas common actions must to amount
i hope therefore that the soon decision to a reinforced cooperation between certain states as with including the italy to agreements to make on common rules for contributions and pensions
than can i least also sleep
mr fatuzzo that hope we all
the swedish and danish social vote against the report gildelgado on closer cooperation
we are the agree with the general principles the the report establish the first must the development the a closer cooperation within the institutional framework the the european union to done and the second must the with the political and legal conditions the in the treaty the amsterdam for the introduction the a closer cooperation are included see to prevent that the solidarity between the member in the way is and the common legal area the broken
we recognise that a certain level the distinction in the european integration terms pace and depth useful can are provided the common objectives left continue and the distinction as the if a instrument that only the exception and during a period the used which still respected the that each country itself certainly when the part wishes to take the the policies which a closer cooperation is made
the reason why we not for the report can vote is that we the amendments for the political and legal conditions for a closer cooperation not can adopt
the more the the condition that a closer cooperation within the framework the the treaty must continue and the abolition the the veto and the the possibility the issue the the agenda the the european council to to are contrary with the fundamental principles which the cooperation in the eu backed is
the group vote against the report  on closer cooperation
the report the the abolition the the veto for what there in the practice the amounts that countries the favour are the more integration their the can to without broad support the the population
the underlying idea is in fact further to can besides to a still reinforced union without the pollution to affected the the enlargement what the eu the have compulsory
a closer cooperation will still more than now the case is a centralisation the the most policy to result have also the most sensitive
gilrobles like example also for the common foreign and security a closer cooperation to the to
we are other the opinion that the future development the need the a differentiated and flexible cooperation in europe will do increase
the take the decisions with qualified majority on still important issues is in fight with the fundamental values the the democracy
the can done that countries the traditionally a forthcoming the when they sovereignty must give for the fait fact to to are that a the national level rejected proposal the eu however adopted the
the countries the not won are for a farreaching integration rest than only still the behind alternative the adopted legislation on to take without real influence to have had
they can the legislation the the pioneer have approved however not would
the group wishes a freer and flexible europe where the not compulsory the the everything part to take
we wish a europe the democracy and diversity
therefore vote we against the report
i i voted against the report gilrobles on closer cooperation or to the forms the cooperation where not all members the the union the involved are but only some
because although this report the very rigid system the title vii the the eu the amsterdam seeks to flexible what positive is remains the result very unsatisfactory
the report witness the a many to  vision the the union which all forms the cooperation included must are within one only institutional framework and at are the the objective the a superstate
the report the even for to the common foreign and security the to take in the closer cooperation what would mean that this complexes still more centralised the than now the case is see paragraph the the resolution
this proposals are unacceptable because the need the cooperation in europe the very strong present is but different forms and his has not more in a uniform community framework can be well which the decisionmaking shortcomings the basis the majority
moreover the the report not specific explanation and that is a important vacuum on how closer cooperation with third the the member would must function within the current institutional framework if this not amended the
in fact is the parliament a rearguard
the has the used already agree opposition against the introduction the differentiated cooperation in the treaty the amsterdam but end the the even end drawn by in to vote with closer cooperation
today trying the the flexible the the closer cooperation against to the but also this fight will the end lose
we are the opinion that the the level the the cooperation the yes must be mentioned the not objectives ex must set or restrictions on new forms the cooperation or obligations the regard the their function
for some forms the cooperation can the the community framework use if the this wishes for other can the hoc ad institutions create the only by a secretariat with the union linked are
finally deserves the the prefer that the the differentiated cooperation the equalisation the applied unless we than again to make to with the problems the the the community system suffers
there must the be out that the mechanism that now know the under the name closer cooperation already long was for the treaty the amsterdam
some member the their cooperation wanted strengthen and further wanted to than the integration that is down in the treaties have different instruments developed as the social charter the agreements the schengen the economic and monetary union etc
the could they besides according different speeds and objectives
by the force the the treaty the amsterdam are this instruments formalise with particularly by the introduction the the understanding closer cooperation in the treaty on the european union title vii and the treaty to up the the european community article
the objective the this cooperation is a limited number member the forward want to and this also in the are the possibility to give the european integration to strengthen the condition that this happening within a only institutional framework
europe has because still more effort to the same pace forward to to
to to avoid that the development the the whole delayed the to certain member the possibility to through the development the the mechanism the the closer cooperation forward to to
the application the this instrument is linked the conditions to to avoid that the european union a europe or la à or a europe the different speeds the this legitimate concern the moreover central in the debate on this issue
there must the reminded be that accordance the treaty the amsterdam closer cooperation with particularly the must have the policies the not the under the exclusive competence the the community conducive must are for the achieve the the objectives the the union the principles the the treaties must respect only must used be if last tool and a majority the member must concern
closer cooperation would a important role can play in the europe the after the enlargement
in the framework the the current provisions can this mechanism however not correctly function
therefore is the reform the this instrument the the agenda placed the the igc order the use that to facilitate
the parliament has accordingly a position welcome resolution the april that the before report seeks to concrete
to closer cooperation to promote is the with particularly necessary the veto the to abolish and the instrument the closer cooperation only to use when minimum third the the member involved involved is and the from to extend to the common foreign and security
the rapporteur the rightly the emphasis the the fact that the initiative the the commission the full participation the the european parliament and the legal control the the court the justice binding conditions must are for all forms the closer cooperation
when this mechanism sensible the used can the a the the resources are to the union from the current impasse to to
within the european union have the last time comprehensive debates place on what know the if the principle the the closer cooperation
very simple said means this that the large member more and more can into than the small member the the eu
the those the a such policy want in principle a europe with two areas create
they want that the european union in a quickly and a slowly pace the built one for countries the strengthened want work and one for countries the in a more pace the way to economic integration want make
i think not that the necessarily a healthy step forward means for the european union if the  the principle the closer cooperation fully approve and changes
to my opinion would this contrary against both the objectives the the the up were the if the spirit the the treaty the rome and against all this next treaties
the must not forget that the european act in the basis has the for the introduction the a internal market
there are largescale structural in the life established to the countries the objective within the european union to help the the acquire after way the time the a greater competitiveness
the  claimed when that they not a internal market for only a few countries wanted but all the the european union participating countries in the wanted to active and  part to take the the new internal market
therefore were extensive appropriations allocated for the european structural
the structures the basis which the internal market work are already from the beginning the the years a success
the principle the equality between poorer and richer countries was hard made with ideas for the achieve the a new european monetary union
again if the relatively poor and small countries the the european union their economic structures not had can reform would they not have can meet the the economic criterion for accession as down in the treaty the maastricht
the  have largescale programme programmes for the structural and the cohesion for the smaller and poorer countries financed so so possible countries part would can take the the european monetary union
there is need the institutional equality with the view the the negotiations during the next intergovernmental conference
the influence the the smaller member can not be wiped by a number greater countries within the eu the as i already earlier said the principle the closer cooperation want apply
this would not healthy matter are for the european union or now or in the future
the would however certainly not healthy matter are with the view the the future enlargement the the european union
we are by the bank taken positive the a socalled flexible integration
the integration can in the whole union improve be by a group countries further to let to the cooperation within a the area to strengthen and same to prevent that a or several member a flexible integration programme
as the common objectives the the union within the framework the a flexible integration encouraged be and as not few member excluded the the participation find we this a good solution the further developed must be
to to prevent that a future eu with to member a europe or la à the which the cohesion between the member danger to disappear find we that least the half the all member must part to take the a flexible integration
further are we against the creation in the eu the double  therefore are we against a flexible integration what the foreign and security the the eu the
since the failure the the eu the the balkans is the extremely important that the eu if whole the capacity has to to can intervene in its near environment and the time on staff and resources can have for conflict and missions
the institutional and operational structures the the weu must fully integrated to be in the common security
the eu must a credible foreign policy to to
we can not always the the united states continue to
same is the the important that the involvement the the united states retain remains we want not that there in the eu a parallel  the
what we still less like want is that a number member assessments in the framework the a flexible integration the this area
therefore is the the important to the transatlantic link to retain while there course a better labour and coordination can to
we are the opinion that a credible common european foreign policy also in the future within the now current rules developed must be
decisions must with majority the vote be taken but the possibility the a constructive veto must continue there that like say that a country ensure can choose to outside progress to continue but other countries not they to further to to
i am pleased on the report the the mr gilrobles on closer cooperation
with only regret accepted i that there in a comprehensive european union need will are the a vanguard but i am the with the mr gilrobles agree that there the a number fundamental conditions met must be
closer cooperation must be carried in the institutional framework the the union
the is necessary that there one only institutional framework the maintained which all members the the parliament and the the commission fully participate the the exercise the the tasks the each the this institutions
the procedure for the institution the closer cooperation must for all pillars right are and based are the the existing procedure for the first pillar with respect the the few changes the the mr gilrobles in are report has explained
i am that convinced that only the community system the necessary guarantees offers the the area the democratic control legal assessment and solidarity if closer cooperation necessary that to are
european cooperation can useful are to crossborder problems the to solve
what is than more for the hand than cooperation between neighbouring states as the already before the the the the european union was in the form the the benelux and the cooperation between the nordic countries
a such cooperation between neighbours is in many cases to prefer over expensive opacity and difficult by the electorate  
not few rule the the eu one further cooperation in the way to are there conditions the to to or to demands that also others must can part
therefore like i the closer cooperation between neighbours as the not intended is to others to disadvantage as little possible rules and restrictions impose
in the practice see we within the eu now already countries and 
that is not to cores but to a diversity the with member only but greater the
therefore is the better to for the whole eu from to to the interparliamentary cooperation and the right the diversity the commission does proposals the parliament the the final and the national parliaments decide or their member the the such judgement with
the british labour the the group are satisfied on the approval the their contribution the the current activities the the igc with the to closer cooperation without that they all details that support
the is clear that in a comprehensive union the commitment the closer cooperation easier must be made but here must only efficient use the be made
closer cooperation must accessible continue for those the there initially not the have part
the existing core the common policy and responsibilities must not be undermined
this closer cooperation must within the existing institutional structure place
we are the agree with this points from the report also already require the details further the in the framework the the igc
i i i abstained the vote the the final
the swedish christian find that military issues not suitable are for closer cooperation
same am i the opinion that the issue the the reduction the the number member third in place the the half that necessary is to closer cooperation to can initiate and the abolition the the veto fact not topical are before the enlargement the the eu with the eastern countries is completed
the new member must participate the the conference the the framework that the that at the closer cooperation must send
 a
mr the president the report the mrs sudre is the large as not the capital important for the outermost regions but my group the alliance has the the vote abstained and i would want explain why
the problems the in the report be dealt are know their specific nature not not more to be stressed
the alliance is however disappointed because the report this opportunity not has matter to in the outermost regions a sustainable ecological social and cultural development to the to to the during the vote adopted amendments improve the text the this point also not
we regret the that the positions the the parliament today the the vote has welcome same are if the the the union the regard the this areas
the alliance regrets with particularly the quite defensive attitude the the report the the acp and the countries
the alliance clearly the also from against the conservation the the exceptions
we are for the principle the on which exceptions the the common policy in the outermost regions case per case must be examined
i think the with particularly the the aid and the tax policy
we regret the that the is entered the the demand to the application the the principle the polluter pays to change this the the door opening open for abuse
we regret the also that there not the about or even report made the the need to protection the the biodiversity what however a the the most resources the the outermost areas is
this areas would a wonderful laboratory can are the the area the sustainable development
this is again a missed opportunity
we are other pleased on the points in the report the the have the the promotion the renewable energy and the control the polluting industrial activities
best mr fernández the here close i is if we vote i i with pleasure for this resolution voted the you the and certainly supported you as you always does if the on  canary islands is
the party the the pensioners and the pensioners the behind this party are know this islands good because they for the tourist sector the vital important are
i believe that the european union more view must have and more its best must do than they to now to was for the azores the canary islands  accumulated martinique madeira and réunion
this islands must feel that they active part of the the european union and hope can they thanks the union changed be in a heading for tourists and a heading also for the people itself
the european parliament and in the first place the group have already the necessary done to the understanding ultraperipheral accepted to to that that from the besetting  and that that also from the report the the mr fernández martín
in that last report the ensure favour this understanding in the treaties the to take now have we than the  which the european policy for the outermost region programmes agree to more the the come the placed
the commission has long hesitated and itself often questions that that from the disappear the claudio from the postponement the the revision the  and the reduction the the for this programme programmes available resources
the  is therefore exactly the the right at the european parliament clearly the again from for measures the various areas the agriculture to fisheries the environment to transport and energy while also the society not forget the
this must course the necessary budgetary resources be allocated the same at the there to the industries look what for the azores means that the dispute regarding milk and sugar eventually is
i quote here member the the  eight the the fundamental important that in agreement with article member the for the the outermost regions adapted  the be as this region programmes economic much on continue the a limited number products or even the one only product
now is the wait the initiatives the the side the the commission and the national and regional authorities
the bureaucratic term outermost areas would us almost do forget that there women and men life in caledonia martinique martinique accumulated réunion  st pierre and   wallis  and already our other areas in the pacific indian and atlantic atlantic the a bridge forms between europe and the other continents and civilisations both the the area the knowledge if the solidarity and beauty
in are antiracist fast to lowest and footing has the europe the brussels unfair to not to say rather action the our fellow the the thousands kilometres the paris madrid or lisbon our values in reinstate the
the technocrats the european judges were that we the  the our communities in the overseas areas the means for and especially our small producers protect had abolish
from brussels has the our  from martinique our rice and our tropical results in risk the
but brussels is especially responsible for the systematic destruction the our  in martinique in martinique in madeira or the the canary islands
the european commission is gave for the 
any year the the two billion euro the duties present the chiquita or del 
how can the our overseas areas and departments than the necessary budget refuse if compensation for the costs the resulting from the transport  and the investment in universities and hospitals
when our areas in the antilles or the pacific atlantic in same areas are if the tax the american multinationals if kodak microsoft boeing and cargill use to the large scale  to paying must the on the the right the equal geographical competition and the right the equality between all europeans a part the the european budget be credit example through a tax the the the proceeds for the development the the economic social and cultural life the our fellow in regions the by their location ultraperipheral are but from the view the the civilisation a central role role
the there the outermost areas has many to make with the colonial history
in the medieval were the areas and their peoples not the europe and also now be they not if really european given
spain portugal france england and netherlands had already before the e century large colonial rich conquer and then have also belgium germany denmark and italy  tried to same to do
now is the colonial period over
the oppressed peoples have itself  or were their independence preventive offered because the old squirming not sense had in a  the he end however would must lose
what the member the the eu outside the geographical europe now still the territory on have are small or sparsely leftovers the their former colonial rich
the member the the eu to very different to with their peripheral regions
spain and portugal count their islands in the atlantic atlantic to
the islands can by their current composition and by their relative vicinity be given if a simply part the their country
netherlands and denmark have each also two territories in or the the side the the atlantic atlantic but the areas be emphatically not negotiators to the european union
other possession france overseas departments in the indian atlantic and the caribbean area
this proposal puts my group for a difficult choice
one want we areas with within within and outside europe support to same living and  to achieve if now within the member the the eu usual is
that is a issue the solidarity
hand have we serious doubts on the to outermost areas statehood the former colonies
for the spanish and portuguese islands is this model tenable for the  the areas fact not
the would better a same status can have if the current acp the the same history a another type relationship with europe have was
the the assessment the the amendments has my group tried a balance to find between the most farreaching fails the the terms the the peripheral interests and the indifference for or even significance against this subject as the there in member the with this subject not few bond have
our significance against the colonial background the this subject have we however in all cases subordinate made the the interests the the people the this areas
we believe that the before report very the is there must because quickly and the objective way implementation be given the article member the the treaty on the european union
this region programmes have a number whole own  the usually the the with the fact that the islands are and normally free far the the european continent from are also are this areas traditionally on the one only product
we are welcome with the fact that there in the report ideas included are the largely part with the proposals the we in the parliamentary committees have tabled
we want however the say that there not sufficient attention the spent the a number special situations the social level as the the in a number the this region programmes arise
also here again must there specific measures be affected and that can if the amendment that we special this have tabled the adopted
 a
mr the president the alliance has for the report the the mr bowis voted although we however pleased can are on the fact that the european parliament and the commission with its paper the european consumers interesting prospects offer must the food a absolute priority continue in us policy
we must however also modest continue
with the progress the the scientific research the there because constantly new questions
look you but to the development the the bse
there be any week new cases discovered in geographical areas the to now to spared were has
this is with particularly the case in a department the french lorraine in the area the the vosges
many the the measures the in the paper be proposed must still the many points be  to the food actually to guarantee and especially the confidence the the consumers to restore
to the most points one the european authority for food the up of is a gratifying fact and gives high expectations
the independence the the authority will a essential condition are for its credibility
the independence is essential the authority must fully  the the interests the  or member
this independence requires also financial independence
the union must resources kind to ensure to ensure that the authority good can function will the  however enough to the concerned consumer that to convince that what the are plates and soon also in are glass ends really safe is
the authority must for with its work can start and we hope that the issue the the seat in this respect not obstacle will forms
in the meantime must the union its tasks on risk and management the the area the food continue
they must daily a eye in the important the
only as can we guarantee that the leaders in their specific policies really account the with the demands the the citizens
the issue the the shop  in the feed the a new crisis can cause is unacceptable
the must this substances future ban
the are this strong positions the the citizens expect and not the type provocation that serious consequences can have for the health
the regard the this type scientific recognised facts must there not few spinelessness are
that is also the thrust the the report the the mr bowis
therefore has the green group are full support given the the done work and for the report voted
mr the president  you i if i the presidency and the interpreters still just  to to my last explanations to listen i wanted fact especially my solidarity express with those the our explanations into and for what myself the the italian  
i will try as little possible the my right use to make but i wanted say that i also the this report that is on the up the a authority i motion
the is for the hand why this report important is as remind i i that a neighbour the i a time in the hospital was included with terrible stomach because he toxic dorado had eat the he not by a competent body had let control
with are report will john bowis ensure ensure that we always healthy eat to up so our health not risk the
you you said that the your last vote was mr fatuzzo but you saying however for today
i was already concern
mr the president i i for the report the the mr bowis voted the i course like congratulate with the excellent work that he if rapporteur has done
i would my satisfaction want express on the fact that us parliament last are position has given on this extremely important subject already regret i the that this position only months after the presentation the the paper by the european commission the january on is
the was absolutely necessary that we us statements on a subject that for our citizens as important is
with our vote have we clarification provided on the role and the composition the the future european authority for food but also our demands express made the the area the the financing and the independence the the authority
i hope than also that the commission will agree with the demands the the european parliament
this first step must us not do forget that there still a many work the the shop is the the area the management with particularly what the development and improvement the the early system but also the traceability or the communication with the public the
this report is not point but must the beginning are the a extended programme which very our embody under the look the the
the paper the the commission on food seems the the first face to based the good intentions because the with particularly proposed a european bureau for food the to up that responsible is with the management the a network for early warning and the provide the fully independent opinions the the authorities the responsible are for management
if the the report however read or  the the resolution the the european parliament on this issue remains there the the good impression little on
than that already soon that the bureau to objective has national powers on safety in to  or paralysed to to to they subordinate to make the the objectives the the commission
that is absolutely unacceptable
the french should not forget that despite the fine statements the the commission that they like ensure for the highest level the food in the union the the certainly the commission is and no otherwise the the interests the the free goods late concept the the the the health the is the commission and no otherwise the example france for the court the justice challenge because the are embargo the british beef use
the is unacceptable that we the what for way than also distance must do the our national powers and  the the area the food
that is however where the up the the bureau gradually to will lead
the first must remind reminded be that the competence to opinions to provide a crucial role plays
in the affair the the mad has the french government the embargo  because they could support the the independent opinion the the french bureau for food  while the supposedly scientific european committee not only objection looked in the imports the british beef to france
if therefore a european bureau necessary is must the a supplementary role play and not the slightest favour do the the legitimacy the the national offices
this is however no the thrust the the paper which the that the european bureau for the whole union the scientific reference will be page
the second must the european bureau fully independent are
the director the the bureau must in not case appointed be by the commission in unlike to what the european parliament proposed paragraph the the resolution
the scientific experts should nor by its appointed be even not after a appear strict procedure
finally must the bureau critical can are the the commission itself
that is at not the point the the paper that calls that the services the the bureau and the the the commission closely work because clarification the with a certain  also can the authority the bureau the the needs the the services the the commission meet to page
the third must the bureau the not interfere with management and regulatory tasks
the paper the the commission is as kind this to recognise but when the the carefully read that that the regulatory competence the must be protected the competence the consequence the commission is and not the the the countries
that from the commission and the parliament not this bureau the name to give the european authority a name the fully in contradiction is with the philosophy the there were the the basis is
the european parliament add here even the to in paragraph the are resolution that the necessary is the powers the must be transferred the a closely research to issues while there were at not powers were on to to
the paper and the report the the parliament seem therefore provided to are and therefore oppose we us opposed
the member must their full responsibility retain the the area the food because they are close the their citizens and respond more than the commission the constantly  the by its 
a bureau that to task has a european look the the situation to the is doubt necessary but must the a strictly advisory role play and fully independent are
the best would are if the only a consequently was the the national offices and the  in the framework the a network
the crises and the food the the in a number countries the the european union have occurred forms a serious problem for the society and the health we know not how safe us food is
the is the in the first place to the up the a european authority for food and to scientific risk the authority must closely work with the existing national agencies the this area and the most european consumer
the must the however not continue
we must also look to the methods the in the agriculture and the  used be to the problems the the imports the food to the composition the feedingstuffs to the upper for dioxins and phosphorus to additives in food and other substances the safety the the food must priority to
also therefore is the the important that support the is the regional products and crops the the agriculture within the framework the family and rural
the problem the the food is now a priority concern for the citizens the our countries
this problem has now particularly sharp forms adopted not only because the progress in our scientific prime but especially also because clear the the light is has what the consequences are the certain advantages the against any price  achieve and based the the ideology the the free market
as mrs thomasmauro morning very rightly has stressed must we today the harmful effects for the health correct the a policy that for a very large part by the commission is down
the question is how and with what resources we our citizens the best can protect
if we example what the bse the a look throw the the recent events and than need we only but to the example the france to look see we that thanks the there the a competence and independent national bureau for food the french authorities in the are been with urgency the necessary  to take to the population to protect
other additional the input the the european institutions to now to very many to wish on
in the first place were the council and the commission to listen to the warnings the the french scientists the now completely rightly are has
then was the less judgement the the court the justice against the conservation the the embargo the british beef what france had decided the expressly scientific opinion
the behaviour the the european institutions in this for the food the our citizens essential matter has obviously led to real dangers for the health the the europeans
the must lessons be drawn
with the view the the subsidiarity and the efficiency must the priority be given the measures the national level where independent  in short time wellfounded scientific opinions can give the not affected are by other considerations and where the political authorities quickly the necessary decisions can take the the area the management the protection the the populations the their this a mandate have given
in the context can a european bureau a useful role play the condition that the really independent is with particularly the regard the the services the the commission and the various groups the there active are and the a supplementary and support role plays the for the the national offices which the a consequently must are the must however with particularly a platform are for the exchange the knowledge
that is not at line with the proposals the the  this give the impression that the food especially the used if a new pretext to the longstanding way the within the the commission from to extend the expense the the national bodies and the safety the the citizens
the report the without work or confuse the by the commission desired  on the is not more to a european bureau but to a authority
the appointment the the director the the authority by the commission take the report very normal the is doubt the best way to the independence that to guarantee
the seat to brussels the the authority is not only problem this will they very close in the near are the the commission and therefore completely admissible  are for their needs as the paper recommend
the the other on must the authority responsible are to the demands the reports statistics and documents the the member
in point the the report the than again the traditional way the inevitable transfer the powers announced
behind the apparent and doubt genuine to to strengthening the the food in europe is therefore again the wellknown logic find the logic the the  the the member both here if the other areas the the erosion the the powers and the efficiency the the national bodies the favour the a large particular and wishywashy european institution the theoretical although independent is but in reality controlled the by the commission and its disasters 
the european authority for food will only the competence have to the make the scientific analyses the the risk programmes for food and will therefore not responsible be with the political management the this risks
this powers must clear be contained
we had moreover the prefer given the a bureau
the term the the authority also the management on the early system  that information the the member and the european commission therapies if such will they also if coordinator act between the national offices
we are confidence the this term the accordance the educationalists the the perfect  synonymous is with authoritarian 
is the example not for that the authority the term also the management the on the  the the 
therefore i i i the vote abstained
the my on i i not need the a authority to my confidence to restore
in france have we the  a institution which i confidence i and which the opinions with particularly in the framework the the mad reliable are has
we have for amendment voted because we very many important attach the the protection the the european cultural heritage the the level the local food
we are however concern that the mentioned resources the protection the the local food does will work
are licences and certificates not precisely a means to the in the beginning the recital i mentioned principle to were
the small local producers will there not access to have because the bureaucratic tape the complexity and the costs the such certificates
we have against amendment voted because this the area the the risk leave and now already in the direction is the management
the authority one the states not to advise on the follow the the a or other procedure
that is not its task
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
special administrative region prc
the the item is the report a the the mr treaties behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the first and second annual the the european commission on the special administrative region prc com c cos com c cos
mr the president in september are there for the second time since the former british colony was transferred the the chinese regime elections taken in prc
the the analysis the the results to a number worrying trends the the light which that that not everything the a hipc hipc is
the turnout the the voters drop the in to and the support the the local  parties took to while there same a remarkable fall in support the the  parties to see was
there are i i few reasons why the voters in prc for apathy have elected in place the use to make the the recently introduced vote
the main problem is that the  the the the free and transparent is hardly described can be if a actually democratic done
space the the sixty seats be directly elected the basis the the general right which three million inhabitants the prc should participate
the other seats be elected by such electorate from from the powerful business the prc  and  parties
also has the legislative power little real power
the only real power is the the    and are government the in fact is appointed by beijing
the executive power is total separate the the legislative power the more the function the a guarddog has been and not much the the a really  body
the lack the real power the the legislative body has ensure taken that the introduction  are and little sense have to part to take the elections the in their view not really democratic are
although there in the fundamental law the the  the prc is a number specific criteria are down for the the the elections in contains this legislation however provisions for the possible introduction the the general right which than all seats eligibility be the for the elections the
there are however people the clear the power the the large money want protect the resistance offer the a such step
even if the general right introduced would be the prefer would earlier than later would however still not all current problems resolved be
this right would by must to with a reform the the political institutions the the special administrative region prc
the executive power has not  in the legislative power what means that this two institutions in fact fully separate are the other
because the executive power therefore not really responsibility not the to to the the elected representatives and because the elected representatives not on real power have not the executive power not responsibility the to to for are political words and action
there must attention to be spent the the amendment the the rules which the executive and the legislative power the must the that is the only way to a workable mutual relationship to guarantee
there are still more affairs the must be investigated
the way the appointment the people for deflagging would including can the must this political posts are or must this officials be appointed
apart the this problems the also the growing chinese intervention with the affairs the prc still more
the rule is the cornerstone the the policy a country two systems
three recent controversial cases have farreaching consequences had for the integrity the the rule and end for the autonomy the prc itself
two that have led to execution the people the crimes had committed in prc where the death is abolished
the third matter had the the a court the the highest court the hong hong on a controversial needed which there was the emphasise in prc the children the chinese parents the itself the status the residents the prc have
the government the prc was dissatisfied on the liberal court and point the to the chinese authorities to the fundamental law again to interpret
many observers find that the a worrying precedent is created which china in the the the to time interpretations to give the the fundamental law if a local judge a decision the the or the government the prc or the politicians the the mainland not 
the situation was still aggravated because officials the the mainland did in to intervene in the press and the  the prc with taiwan after the recent taiwanese elections
with the to my comments on the dominant role the the family   which today many interest was in the media the prc in few sectors the the economy the prc like i there the point that i this issue i raised because this matter the i is presented by leading men in prc and the subject was the a comprehensive discussion in the media when i recently itself in prc was
i like also like the issue the  access the there to
i think the very expected that this by a number governments is blocked
if we really believe in the approach the a country two systems than is this the only way to this for other to to
the people with a passport from prc must without only stipulating  access be given
to now to i i i at the the negative aspects
despite this worrying events am i however not most pessimistic on the future the prc
the concept the a country two systems remains reasonable intact but if this if failure will the still difficult the to the problem between china and taiwan the to solve that is fact the problem
finally like i already those thank the part have taken the the discuss the this report my colleagues the the commission foreign affairs human common security and defence and the secretariat the the commission the foreign affairs in the particularly mrs  and the commissioner
president if rapporteur for opinion the the commission industry external trade and research like i however like still agree point the the important the prc for the international trade
already in was prc eighth the the  the important  and the tenth trading the the european union
since and despite the asian financial crisis is the  between the european union and prc there their the forward has
what the the relations between prc and are international partners more the the world parts the eu and prc a number common objectives and work both very closely together what useful is with the view the the next pursued
in my opinion i i the the important role the prc can play the the accession the china to the world
prc can the china show how a open fully integrated market a leading role can play in the region and the the way economic development and sustainable growth can achieve
since prc addition a important market is for china can prc are influence exercise the the economic reforms in china
to the reason colleagues must we point the the important the a reinforced cooperation between the european union and prc the financial area and the the level the trade and direct foreign investment
prc talking the over years very what bilateral agreements
we should not forget that in the framework the the  with the to the any accession the china to the world this bilateral agreements again must be investigated
although we the economic level rightly should speak the a success must i here however still point the few detects namely the protection the the intellectual rights remains a large problem
our companies be still still faced with violations the the copyright and the manufacture and the sell the counterfeiting
also the social level have we ensure
the working would because especially for the immigrants to wish leave
what the research the must we that insist that prc both the european union in the many projects the the started are a full role play
i like first the mr treaties the i congratulate with the excellent work that he for this extremely important issue has done
the am i that commissioner patten today here present is i i large appreciation for him for are positions and are activities if governor the prc
i like briefly on continue are the two the the i i many important points
the first point the a purely legal issue
according i are we the there all on agree that if with the by the mr treaties in are report mentioned activities the principle the the rule the violated that the basis would must are for the legal and constitutional framework the prc the more general principle the a country two systems the the again is to are although the further development the prc precisely the this principle is based
my second comment the the with the dangers for the press
if the like that the principle the a country two systems the the right way development and this was in fact a revolution in the international relations because this a new increases was contrary must the ensure for protection and respect the the press
know you why
because only with press the proposals to outside can act and the situations the the item can be the the ensure can ensure that everything within the by us all desired democratic framework remains
mr the president also i like the mr treaties like congratulate with are report
i am him grateful for the fact that he again as flexible is been the the write the this report and prepared was are colleagues involved to involve now need we least not longterm  to follow this already agreement could be achieved the the up the the report
again saw we that the  in prc in large lines very good is has and few  how were 
any week find there still demonstrations place in prc there be movements allowed in prc the in china not be permitted the economy has a difficult time see but employs still still and as the mr the clercq already said is the  the china in fact a opportunity for prc especially given the enormous strong financial services and because the fact that a large part the the  already to china is moved
the mr treaties has there however already the out that there still still worrying issues there this be clear explained in are report therefore i need this now not to mention
the like i a or two examples give
the happen that the chinese  mrs   and the officials his that they the  better had support is in my view a interference in the affairs the a another country
the various reports the report that they under pressure be the to not trade with taiwan to to are also worrying
the recent resignation or the strasbourg the a the the directors the  prc seems the result to are the pressure from the mainland
already this affairs are the itself still not as important because they make part from the a normal struggle the you the more see if prc but a basis had with a good effectively democratic system that pressure is against this type pressure
we must there however account that the that the democracy in prc not the direction based the we like had given
we have already hear tell on the  system
as a adviser the the former governor us recently in the financial times additional know is clear the step in the regulations since see
if you however see that someone already   resignation the because its work in the legislative institution not sense more has is that for i a clear sign that there something wrong is
the occurred also not many good for the future if a employee the the  accused the the interference in opinion
the is not only but a issue the a number individual facts
there must still very what modernisation be in prc and that can only done if there a consensus is this is the  in the prc the now however bad less
we recognise that the transfer flexible is has but there remains a number affairs that we in the monitoring must the
i hope that we by can to with this reports and this reports the the parliament so we the situation in prc the the footing can follow
mr the president i like john treaties also like congratulate with are report
i funds him that he the opportunity has been to this the to to
if i already the something from the report a point would make than is that the the the issue in the with the balance and the perspective
see the the glass half are or half know
the mr treaties the rightly the three cases the reason to concern was
he the rightly the the lack the progress the the introduction the the general right for the election the the  the discrimination against companies the  with taiwan have and the the reunification confidence in the political system
this are indeed serious challenges and how grateful we also must are that everything as good is has must we us however however continue they to the fact that there not greater progress is made
for already those the with i believe that the the challenge the the e century the democratisation the china is is prc course a communityrelated experiment
i would like something know the the commissioner on the summit the the mr prodi previous week had with the chinese and i am hear or prc also subject the discussion is been
democracy and rule can not be achieved if the west not determined are voice late hear
i i remains the european union terms performance the this area far behind the the united states the america
i know that our member the difficult find to the chinese the to speak the issues the human because they afraid are for economic sanctions if  but if there a area is which western favour behind the european flag would can to are than is that however certainly the this area
if the human must be raised must we the united states match
the the took the previous week is the to agreement has on a statement which under other the promotion the the human if objective the the  cooperation defined the
that is already a step forward but we must us up to the commission and insist the a active involvement the this area no will the the a such approach more can benefit than in prc
mr the president with assent and appreciation has our group knowledge taken the the report the mr treaties
addition the broad satisfaction on the function the the a country two  parts we the call to permanent vigilance this is is after worrying incidents
if first speak we our distress from on the decision the the  government to a interpretation the the fundamental law the the to questions the the permanent committee the the national congress
the veto that china this on decisions the courts in prc would can to the the legal autonomy the the special administrative region the discussion
this is to more firsthand because the government in prc not the a democratic elected majority founded
the elections for the legislative council a month ago  again the democratic cease
the electorate showing their contempt for the system which only the the seats too were with directly 
that declared also the low turnout
that a members  convenient then certainly on the occupation the six seats and only report the right have to the other half the the parliament to choose makes the elections to a farce
the the the gap between poor and rich not only in the taken but also increase
we form than also for early introduction the direct elections the last in when there not legal obstacles more are
the finally mr the president argue we continuing vigilance with the to the press the need the laws on fair competition and the possibility to a open  the prc with taiwan
the this basis recommend we a stimulating trade the regard the prc the
i am pleased that i this report must comment and price the excellent work the my gentlemen friend john treaties
we are old friends and what still important is old friends the prc
we speak both with what i with a understatement would can describe if a certain extent the knowledge the the remarkable community
this was a briefly debate but we have a number excellent and good together speeches heard
i was grateful for the his things the the gentlemen mr dimitrakopoulos said on my residence in prc
i am the there with him on agree that freedom the expression and a strong position the the media very important are and if i  the my experience the previous week have the media still still in any case the written media a very strong position
the mr watson was clear that we us the what we say on prc or on other issues not impede would must feel by our  with china
i am always surprised if people the opposite say especially this from the most recent figures that that china last year the relation the the european union a surplus had the billion euro
in the first half the this year was the surplus billion euro and the see to from that the for the whole year will up to billion euro therefore soft expressed the is matter the trade in perspective to the
the is good from that the debate today place because i am previous week still in prc been the was my third visit from the at that i my function if governor i down and my first full hurried if commissioner
i can the parliament from first hand inform that as few gentlemen members already have the there indeed a number problems there
prc remains however a free society without doubt a the the most free societies in asia this that clear from the reports the both the commission if the parliament
the secret the the large success the prc is always already the merger been between the enterprise the china and prc and the characteristics the a the the rule wellfounded free and open society
the in the joint statement established concept the a country two systems is such developed that this special mix remains maintained a mix between a independent kouchner a  authorities policies against corruption and free press the the one on and market the the other on
as from our both reports clear the is the to far on the large acrosstheboard managed to this mix in the to the and i part the opinion in the report the the gentlemen rapporteur that the principles the the regulation reasonable good intact are has
we must the aware that prc a number momentous years has human
not only has prc the truncated must see but immediately after the unreservedly the the flags was prc just if the rest the asia affected by a financial crisis
the witness the the force and  the the people the prc that they also during this  events simply are continue with their work this surprised i also not really
many the them are former refugees or the sons and daughters the refugees they are remind used to affairs the to tackle and  to over to to
i am very welcome with the fact that the economy the prc the now after a number difficult years strong start to restore
this restoration is partly to thank the the professionalism the the excellent apparatchiks the prc and certainly not in the last place the the  and the financial secretary the    with same expertise and dedication have served if i time
prc has on a excellent authorities and the would project been are if that the basis was been the the  which the rapporteur referred
in large lines process everything good but there are course issues the reason to concerns give the many friends the prc
both reports deal this affairs clearly
both reports mention in the particularly the judgments the earlier this year are out in the affairs in the with residence
that was a important issue
we have here attention for asked and we will that the continue insist that the way which this matter was tackled especially the involvement the beijing a absolute exception must continue
there are also other issues been as the recent controversy the academic freedom and the still recently issue on the regulation on public item which a provisional legislation in the place was the the more liberal regulation the my administration had failed this time legislation is namely very what less liberal
i give this further not comment the but i think the the reassuring that the public opinion in prc still still clear makes that the its freedoms and rights very seriously the
that applies also for the media as i already earlier said
the success the long term the a country two systems was always already on the the willingness the the people the prc to the to to for their rights and freedoms to far have they the all ways let see that they determined are that also to do
there are a or two specific issues in our bilateral relationship which in both reports the referred
a of is the  access to the european union for  the the special administrative region prc
this issue does the in same extent with macao for both the commission if the rapporteur give support the  access
this issue presented the last weeks during my visit a number times the
the that at i i just if now there not few doubt on let there that i  access the very support
a number member makes the ensure
this ensure are however absolutely parliament
they find their origin in the concerns on illegal immigration from the mainland china and not much from the special administrative regions prc or macao
we are still still at satisfied on the integrity the the border the ground and on the integrity the the  for 
the  the the council the the system has monitored was if i the good i understand under the impression
i hope that we prepared are  access to to
i hope also that we in the will are the seems economic links with prc to strengthen also by means the step cooperation the other areas as education and environment
we will try the application the the existing instruments the the european community in prc to promote example by participation the the  for research as in the report the the gentlemen rapporteur the recommended
there are still few recommendations in the report the my officials closely will study
i like like still something say on piracy the the area the intellectual property which the mr the clercq has referred
this is already years a problem
my administration had already very strong measures taken to this matter the to tackle and the current administration the currently also extremely strong measures my under leadership the the new director the the  the i moreover free good know because he a number years if  for i has work
everyone is under the impression the the  where he the the approach the this doubt serious problem for the business demonstrated the the
finally are we the absolutely with the parliament agree that this monitoring your monitoring and us monitoring valuable is and must be continue
we have not the intention us to interfere in the affairs the prc but the international community and the european union in the particularly have a rather large important in prc the continuation the the rights and freedoms the prc are down in a treaty that is tabled the the united nations
we continue interest the for prc
this community has on the whole world admiration raised with its performance and does that still still to large satisfaction the the last governor the prc
you thank commissioner patten
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
cooperation with acp the the armed conflicts involved are
the the item is the report a the the mr the van behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament on cooperation with acp the the armed conflicts involved are com c cos
president the communication the the commission which we the here have was half year ago published to the the the wish the the war in central
the lack the consensus is they already the time continue are in the council
since are in the  war already to estimated million people died
in my report am i modest a number proposals to formulate to a end to help make the the something the violence and underdevelopment which many the our acp are happened
proposals also the must avoid that european funds be abused to the heaping to finance
my report is together to summarise in three cs wars coherence and control
more than to now to the case is must there a clear link there between financial aid and debt one and good administration democracy respect for the human and the rule hand
i favour even for the set the a ceiling for military expenditure in the acp limits not longer aid and debt the granted
if this conditions not are fulfilled than must the european union adapted measures dare take way the diplomatic pressure and the suspend the aid to sanctions with a prefer for weapon and  or socalled anxiously restore the the changes élites and not the population take
i would also the the commission in that the want insist the the apply the  criteria for the suspension the aid
the would believe i particularly useful are to in the framework the article the the  a list the to to the all possible infringements the this agreement
currently can i i not the the impression mean that the commission to many a hoc ad approach used the its the accusation can that with two standards and two strident to work
addition wars is the focus the more coherence more coherence between the  and the  and between the policy the the union and the policy the the member
situations as in the case the ethiopia which the european commission and some member the aid frozen have while other member new programmes have started must absolutely be avoid
also is there urgent need the a more control the the use the european money
acp involved the armed conflicts must the world and the imf full access provide in their accounts
where european billions the used for the purchase the arms must the structural aid without be suspended
the that level can europe not strict enough are
that everything must think i the attention not how the one the the  the the european union prevention
as rwanda and ethiopia have demonstrated there the usually not the  but the this not always adequate and time the responded
therefore is the the important the causes the the problems early the to tackle
prevention includes also poverty the strengthen the the democracy and the civil a better control the the illegal arms the up the a african force a international regulation for the use the  and a better control the the global ban the soldiers
i favour fact president in my report also for a greater involvement the the european parliament
the seems i essential that we more participation acquire on the freeze or  the the aid
president i hope that the council this important communication the still inspired was by out commissioner   not again to the greek course will refer
want we really a contribution make the a settlement in central than must there now people and coherent be in than must the aid be stated and must there a total arms to for the area the the large lakes
billions must under not only circumstances be secondary to the war
this is unacceptable both the regard the the affected population if the regard the the european taxpayers
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues behalf the commission development like i still a few reservations add the the  affairs the by the mr the van if rapporteur already the the item were the
i can him in each respect  behalf very the commission moreover and i like him also thank for the constructive cooperation the the possible has made that all amendments the the commission development already were  in the text so the president satisfied will can are
he will not many votes must point
the reservations the i today the you the recital like give mr the commissioner have especially to make with the practice
today still  we in our newspapers that the now again bad is in ivory that our own people the this present are to the elections to chance risk are involved to be in a new armed internal conflict
we to us questions on the coherence the the policy the the commission and the the council whose absence i here again regret
while in september was agreed not budgetary aid to provide the countries in war was in march by the commission million euro the rwanda provided while this country considerable parts the the democratic republic congo occupied the in despite the the peace
i know the that there in that conflict many are with butter the their head
but is the than not more for the  the kaliba than for uganda
is the not more for zimbabwe than for rwanda
i i the impression that that clear the the case is because in the practice the a political the two standards and two strident applied the countries the even in one armed conflict terms are
some be almost deserve supported by the european union the imf and others
other countries to aid under strict conditions
that may sometimes directly the power between the one and same conflict involved countries
late the i clear say i am against any form the budgetary aid the warring countries because usually the the aid than however directly or indirectly used for the purchase the arms
here is a second nail can in our european policymaking
the arms deserves here a reference of absolute  the the different conflicts
not only the illegal arms  but also the controlled arms has more view for the fair competition the the arms between than for the peace the we argue
the the us also the opportunity the concepts and conduct to clarify the we in the framework the our cooperation with the acp in certain situations apply a such situation was the the for the communication the the commission and the reports the the colleagues the van and maes the like the the question what there must done when a associated country the a armed conflict is involved
extent the what the rapporteurs this said seems the us inevitably that the union its programmes under other invite if the involved countries in war are to to avoid that the allocated resources be used to military activities to finance
in principle must our support also be reconsidered if countries or regimes military  in neighbouring the concert to or excessive many money the arms spend or the resources to to the individual or minorities in their country to newly
we must article the the new treaty good in the view the the the that europe a policy will to that the the promotion the peace and the prevent and solve the armed conflicts is at
consultation between the conflict parties one and between the union and this parties hand must the the main instrument are
we are just as dismayed if mrs maes on the paradoxical behaviour the the union which millions euros the support are granted the countries the clear are are a the their neighbouring  to fill
the is unacceptable that the the out the the aid sometimes the this way with two standards the measured we make us also ensure on possible contradictions between the action the the member or the a the the member and that the the union
i think that the desirable is that the parliament the this area more transparency and coherence the the day the and more information and control on this policy the
we must there finally also the think that the reduction or freeze the our development the a the country that in war is often together will must to with humanitarian aid the the population the that country the the such conflicts the most to suffering has
also here is the intervention the reliable ngos again essential to such programmes successful and effective from to to
president violent conflicts are always down how beastly also the nature are never unstoppable as a natural the leaders the they cause to a huge responsibility
that is always as but especially in povertystricken countries this must the population duplication suffering this the the development any and years efforts and aid the outside way
and where is the to power place or precisely refuse the the to are
minerals collating other ethnic groups  the divided or a document desertification place
especially africa is a suit dove continent
one the the five africans live in a country that terms is in a serious conflict and to matters the disaster take the conflicts to both in number if in intensity
the large question is why is that fact as
the is the political and moral duty the the european union to everything to do to conflicts in acp to prevent or to put
the report this the the mr the van is i from the heart matter
we must many more be the relation the takes  criteria for end the aid must clear are sanctions must the maat to be applied for each country individual
we must the power take and not the population how difficult that also is and us parliament must directly the the decision to suspension the aid to be involved
the is a too scandal if european billions for requirements the used
the their on are the eu the arms make the conflict parties also responsible for the heavy human suffering and the destroy the the own development
the agreement the cotonou mr the president the rightly the basis for further development participation the the trade and political dialogue but acp the no in violence revive the cooperation the and support the treaty the their
mr the president this report is i from the heart matter and i congratulate the rapporteur that
there is only a thing where i i serious ensure on concerned and that is the the area where the rapporteur the principle the wars like apply with the to debt
the almost each another area support i the principle the wars
i am that convinced that we the responsibility have to the resources the to our available are in our international relations must use for the promotion the good administration democracy and the rule
while this affairs however indeed direction would must give the us policy must there however a important distinction be made if the is to debt
the history from us because that the responsibility for the debt both the those is the a loan give if the those the the loan received also is from the at that the original loans were made the debt increasingly continue grow to a amount that many higher is than the original loans
many countries pay many times the amount that they ever have borrowing
some countries give more from the repayment the debt than the health and education the other and however are the people the suffering under this amended spending the the sums certainly not those the any benefit have had the the originally sent loan
the question what the sense is the debt the debt if the undemocratic governments the funds simply for their own purposes use is a valid argument
that can indeed as has
but perhaps is the opportunity greater that as the people the a country know that the debt is debt the people itself more pressure exercise the their governments to ensure to ensure that there more money released for the social needs
in the report the the mr the van the said that the apply the the  a consistently attitude and courage requires
this am i the that agree
in the case the debt however asking the also to justice and recognition that in many cases the original debt already many times is repaid
mr the president the report the the mr the van calls a fundamental question the we must us ask in what extent international support the countries in conflict a factor is in same conflict and in what extent this same support contributes the the in the the the corrupt and warmonger regimes
i like you here two examples give the the  consequences the international support if the without only conditions the provided the is to one the the poorest and most  areas the this world
i i the on a country that since the years sixty us in the the war has wrong and a country where now peace there but than the a peace the as fragile is that international support there against all good intentions in easy a end the can make i objective here the angola and mozambique
in angola to the government and unita one the the  civil the africa the is unfortunately but already to clear that international aid and than especially aid the the government in aguiar contributed has the the continuation the this conflict
i regret the than also that my own government the the portugal in this war terms is
the treatment is linked the the result international aid can there as therefore to contribute that there a end is the the peace the only years ago as difficult to the is has and than will the war again matter
this is for the european union and the donor a important issue we must behind see to to or the international support in countries if mozambique used the if  for a regime that but little democratic can be mentioned and the the way can contribute to the terminate the a with many effort proving peace
this report calls this type questions the and we must this really seriously on after to think
mr the president i am also pleased with both the communication the the commission if the report that we now deal
a the the  the is the need the a consistently attitude
the european union has a number activities under its umbrella trade agreement the lomé common foreign policy and security external policy
a consistent policy must us main objective are
the second must the prevent the conflicts a priority be the the european union
the measures to now their right place
we have the high representative we have the unity heralded and early warning in the council
they must there now the emphasis the to that we us must concentrate the prevention in place the the military intervention after a conflict already from the hand is got
we must also especially the appropriate emphasis to the affairs if example lack the resources if cause the a conflict
the policy the the commission must that at are to assure that the water the improve in place the reduced as in the past still the agree because to done
as already earlier is said must we the important the good administration and democracy stress
that must a part forms the the  also must we the the member demands that they not politicians support in demands the short term if they not meet the the fundamental conditions in the with good administration and democracy
many to often are we prepared support to to the a group which indirectly a other group the against with if result that the peace the long term this the damaged
what we finally course must do is the electricity the arms to this areas debt and than not only with actions against light arms
i would like want see that as i previous month already in my report i described there action the taken against arms in the whole european union
in many countries is there not control the the activities the arms
they can freely trade introducing and in almost each conflict think you arms behind the enormous amount arms
the is the crucial important that we if part the the code the arms force licences the to questions and that we a beginning make with the control the their activities
the has not sense if government the exports to control if the same individual people their the late to
the same way must we also look to the  manufacture
the is not to rules to have for manufacture within the eu if companies from the eu outside the eu can produce to as the control to but
i am welcome with this report but i emphasise that we no to if we not prepared are the  to the  in to flood
that asking to a many country approach than where we to far to prepared are been
mr the president the report provided a open door in by to to that the enlargement and the intensity the the armed conflicts in africa dramatic forms adopt and for industries human suffering ensure
this dignity words are however also a way to the direct or indirect but how than also peoples responsibility the the large european powers in the majority the the conflicts in africa the rwanda to and with sierra leone to hide
even if today against the background the the new attempt to coup in ivory and the response this the the population the  both jospin if chirac the express against the coup can we impossible the view the for the imperialist nature the the french policy
the links the general  with the french  are know just if are point with a number large french industrial groups the in ivory full economic sectors control
paris has the first coup the  with a benevolent neutrality 
the has even the disgraceful way question on the despicable demagogic political the the  leaders the already since years the population encourage to ethnic ceasefire
the has even question on the fact that ethnic motives a role play the the selection the candidates for the presidential what the disastrous result would can have that the fight to the power expressly in a ethnic war
if the european institutions really something want do the the causes the the problems in africa would they must start with the to sides against the policy the the large european powers itself
mr the president the rapporteur must be regulation with are with large wisdom done work
such good proposal asking there simply to in the practice the to be and we must in us own important there everything the do to us policy this the to vote
in the report the very rightly out the our importance if the aid the many acp this aspect the still not sufficient the political level reflected if the is to the solve the conflicts
the must if point the our work be as
therefore am i welcome that in the report with good feeling the protects the about on the important the positive conditions
this is also all reason to
the profile the crises is the last decades considerably changed
the un the originally is up for conflicts between states trying now only over to to the the control the still more common internal crises
therefore has the european union precisely now if economic and political partner a large responsibility and also large opportunities to influence the the situation from to exercise
the seems the global trend to are that still more conflicts a religious dimension have kosovo chechnya southern nigeria kashmir and the last time a the the worst the moluccas
in the west aware the that not fully
if there there is the religion the the us already quickly thought that we with a  to make have
in the countries be religious tensions however for political purposes used
mr the president to this serious problem the to solve are instruments need
a important objective is to my opinion a inspectors or ombudsman for the human to appoint the specialised is in religious tensions and the the european union 
the european union must also determination and systematically governments under pressure to to international inspectors for the human to to let in countries in war to a balanced and neutral research to the conflicts to do
we must also still continue demands that the governments the to force that the humanitarian aid guaranteed the involved areas achieved
the initiative the the commission the to the cooperation with acp the involved are in a armed conflict to review and its communication the may has the the given to a debate on the most appropriate response the the eu the countries the the a armed conflict involved are and which the eu a close cooperation has
my mr the mr patten proposed in march the this year for that the council general affairs this communication in the context had see the the debate on conflicts in africa
the council general affairs share in may that the involved bodies the the council had continue with their reflection the the issue the development the countries the the armed conflicts involved are and the the basis the the communication the the commission
i regret the that the member the communication the the commission not more the hand have taken
incidents in the democratic republic congo and neighbouring angola and burundi the horn the africa and now also again in africa in the particularly in sierra leone have demonstrated that we this difficult issues not can but
the commission intend currently what its response will are and intend in the particularly article the the agreement the cotonou to to apply the each country which this possibly the application is
a broad framework would the usefulness are if the must respond the a conflict which a  approach the applied
if the council prepared is result to give the the communication by example conclusions the the council to formulate will the commission its full cooperation to the the attempts in this conclusions the many progress again to give the since middle are made with the european policy for crisis and the cfsp also will we there than for ensure that account the taken with the developments the the have occurred in the response the the international community the conflicts
we will also account the with the innovative elements the the agreement the cotonou especially with the to the political dialogue this must us because help the the take the appropriate measures and the give the a proportional and coherent response
the is however clear that there not easy solutions are for this problems as the contribute the the debate the afternoon also clear let see
the  the in any case the by the real political like the the member to a common strategy to to
the commission can the parliament the this area not miracles promise
we are prepared the discussions from to extend to other countries the involved are the armed conflicts
violent conflicts do the not only in the acp for
the european union must also prepared are to the efficient and coherent way to respond the violence in other countries the the world
the communication is a invitation to part to take the a debate on the relations the the eu with countries which the traditional form the development doubtful or outdated is become
that is a difficult debate
we would would already our efforts turn the the help the the acp in the difficult task the poverty and participation the the quickly changing economy
for a considerably number acp is the the challenge however the restoration the peace or the  the regional destabilisation
peace is a necessary  for development and countries the bogged continue in violent conflicts the itself from the the potential benefits the the new cooperation with the eu them offers
they robbing itself also the the opportunities the the ongoing change the the economy with the that brings
they humour the perspectives for foreign investment not only in their own countries but in very the region
in less instability countries make our efforts for poverty and debt a contribution the prevention the long term
the commission has not  after they this communication has done
they has already many initiatives taken which they its ability to a effective approach the the problem the the violent conflicts in acp like strengthen
there the support granted the the oau and subregional organisations as formulating and  the the area the prevention and control
the is remarkable how money there the spent the crisis or the reconstruction after end the a conflict
we try from all power shipping to to behind our efforts for a effective prevention the violence and for peaceful solution the conflicts
the community has a large number resources to its available for prevention and solution the conflicts ranging the trade and agreements to support the institutions the the obtain the more opportunities for the respect the the human and the rights the minorities or for demobilisation and concerning
we to us fully in to a still more and decided use the this instruments to make
within this context pay we the the up the programmes for economic aid and development especially attention the the the the objectives for prevention the conflicts
the problem is however that the rigid nature the this instruments itself the reduction is for what we can do and how we they can apply
budgetary restrictions and comitology to our opportunities to flexible and quickly respond this seems all very otherwise than the 
this think i namely the if we the have on the many instruments the to our available   concept  a good image or the   and a  way or   or the  or verifiable
the concept the the  the a good picture the the ideal situation which the satisfactory way use made can be the the many different  we   in a   just  we verifiable    
we are us however in a other situation also already do we provision attempts to reform
i would this want add that what conflicts the the main gentlemen the development the is in the preventive effect that
our hands are not strong enough if a conflict once really is broken the can we  efforts ex do
there there not few doubt that the hipc that by the eu the financed but still not by the usa currently the the contribution is the prevention in the whole world
the there nor doubt that the very poor countries with large debt will no in instability and conflicts if the rich part the the world not contribution is the the hipc
also the create the regional economic cooperation as the in the agreement the cotonou is a primary contribution the the stability in africa
in the next years will we absolute priority give the the create the regional stability and regional shaping this is a important contribution the the promotion the peace and progress in africa
with the view the what there in this debate is said like i also still something say on the situation in ivory
unfortunately reductions the situation the this in against pace since the elections the sunday
the situation change almost per at
we the the way the the events course closely the and expect that the discussions the article again must be resumed if there after the elections not readily stable situation the
this is really a very unfortunate situation and we fear even still more violence if the item not very quickly the restore
you thank commissioner nielson
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
moratorium the the implementation the the death
commission and this parliament and for what the worth is this commissioner are since year and day opponents the the death
what myself the i i there if member the a another parliament consistent against voted
a the my first decisions if governor the prc was with support the amnesty and human rights watch the delete the the death from the law the prc and i am extremely pleased that he this not again in is included
in the past has the parliament contrary that the the death as if a  kind  the not appropriate in modern societies
i know that many the feelings support
i am welcome that all central and eastern countries the candidate the the union are the death have abolished
we are the way to a europe which the death in the whole continent illegally is
the european union is under all circumstances against the death and has decided campaign to to for global abolition that
this attitude is deeply in us believe in the inherent dignity the all people and in the immunity the any individual
for myself is this still the that i believe in the inviolability the human life
there are still as such countries the to the the death in of be any year death place
a document or two countries place death the industrial scale
the european union trying now already long time a world moratorium to achieve
they has a number directives up to circumstances to identify including the european union specific targeted action can take
this directives determine that the european union the countries will insist the accession to the second optional protocol the the treaty on rights and political rights and to similar regional mechanisms the the abolition the the death aim
also will we the issue the the death in multilateral fora the there to
the european union shares the large concern the all opponents the the death on the momentous that the is impossible to the risk that the death the wrongly the place to zero back to to
this risk the risk that a innocent someone the are life the deprived is for many the us sufficient reason to the if possible punishment to ban
nor accept we the argument that the death serious  would prevent because are deterrent force we see this in our own countries simply not only proof
in countries where the notion the the death address the european union the the a still  use that and the respect the the strict conditions including the death must be applied this conditions are down in different international agreements the the area the the human
during the finnish and the portuguese presidency has the european union the issue the the death under the attention the the the authorities the a large number countries including  and  burundi the market programmes china accumulated india iran kyrgyzstan the palestinian authorities pakistan the  tajikistan thailand surinam and  turkey the united arab  the united states uzbekistan  and zimbabwe
in the case the china have we the fora the our dialogue on human used to the issue time again the to matters
i regret the that china still still almost daily use makes the the death
the european union makes the especially ensure on the impose the the death the people the the time the the crime still not year old were
the european approach the the  meets the international recognised standards for  as down in the international agreements the the area the the human
i i the the beginning said that the european union had decided the issue the the death to the to to in multilateral fora
this was not always easy
the parliament remember the doubt that we last year the the general sitting the the un in november after intensive negotiations have decided that not resolution always still better was than a total  text and that the european union therefore had culture the are initiative in the general sitting the the united nations
the resolution the the un commission for the rights the the human the april on is other to my large pleased with a clear majority adopted
the painful under the those the the death will the must accept the future texts on this issue the the commission for the rights the the human they will the however with force continue oppose against attempts to a resolution the the general sitting to the to to
this would only but lead to a hardening the the positions
the european union has therefore decided that the not sensible would are to during the  a resolution on the death the table to to
meantime continue we campaigns support for the introduction the a moratorium the the death and the wellknown the the death this must end into in the global abolition the the death
we do this with the lines the the under the chapter european initiative for the democracy and the protection the the human
with particularly with line b to we a number on the whole world action initiatives from to the public opinion against the death to mobilise
in was a joint programme up the the commission and the council the europe to the public to inform on different issues the to make have with the abolition the the death in russia turkey albania and ukraine
in the framework the this programme that distributed on a period the two year euro costs the information provided the parliamentarians lawyers and the broad public on legal arguments against the death
i repeat again that this a subject is that we seriously take
the is a subject that i personally highest seriously take
if union can we there with a certain extent the moral authority on speak
we make progress but we have time and persistence need as the not unwavering support the this parliament to us objective to achieve and that is the death to the history to refer if a  which not place more is in the modern world
mr the president mr the commissioner you has repeatedly and rightly said that this parliament and the the group the the european party the against the death and for a complete moratorium the the death has expressed also that last has only to objective the final and global abolition the the death to achieve
that can also not otherwise since the death a direct breach the the right the life and the the the human is the first and most fundamental human which all other are based is because the right the life
the a given at can the however not the words continue and must there a many  attitude be welcome the the defence the what for christian the core the our philosophy and the point for us political act is the special gentlemen the the human and are right the life from the at the are birth to the are natural death
hence that we not only fight for the abolition the the death but also proposals the lines for human to use to campaign to to for a moratorium the the death we find that both the international and local nongovernmental organisations if the churches the the implementation the this lines must be involved
we to that in the first place for because the human and the abolition the the death hand in hand to so we the act the the floor can add further is social input essential for the crucial and the them the a collective feeling that the death must be abolished
still more people are for the abolition the the death as that from the statistics
in countries the he however still always applied
we can our view not the for the fact that in official executions were carried which in only four countries a the the countries is the united states the with executions the the third place are
the abolition the the death must therefore addition the respect the the human a fundamental role play in the relations between the european union and third countries mr the commissioner
that applies in the particularly for the united states because the contradictory is that this country all the world the freedom defends but same on life and death the are citizens has or this now happening with a appeal the the example the the death the enforcement the the public item or because the majority the the population is asking does not the matter
democracy must not dictatorship the the majority are the must nothing from name the the majority do or justify which the fundamental rights the the human be violated and the right the life is the main the the rights
the community the   taught that our world by the death the  because the  and vengeance first be the if that as is must the for the european union a priority objective are this practice from to racial with all economic and political resources the us the available are because the death in fight is with the principles and values the our had forms
the am us therefore that the commission this objective accept and this in the words the the commissioner the attention will to the this essential issue deserves we act the to the principles the we defend
mr the president agree to more clearly the european parliament the for the human dignity and against the death from
this time happening that however after the convention the final text the the charter the the fundamental the the european union has approved
the first chapter of is special the the human dignity devoted there the declared that this churches is and will be respect and protected
there the also that no to the death can be condemned or can be executed
the parliament has declared the charter in the treaties to want into and the the laid rights the european citizens also for citizens the third countries to let apply
there there therefore more reason than ever to now agree the the commission and the council to demands that they the abolition the the death if clause in the negotiations with all third countries into now happening that only with the countries the in the list are to to the union to to act
was again a hints year
according amnesty international were almost people executed and were in countries others the death condemned
china iraq  the democratic republic congo and the united states are few the the countries where people rightly are the
was you that in this last country the united states however a large supporter the democratic principles as my mr  ferrer just said citizens rightly are the in
was you that the in states the america possible is someone the to 
was you that in same country since  imprisoned rightly are the
i draw the attention not the the usa because i antiamerican am because that am i not but because the a friendly democracy is the world on peace and democracy so
we would us all the must questions or we still something more can do
we must contradiction to understand that philanthropic statements only not sufficient are
if we this fight not if a the is political obligation as if we this not the central the us european foreign policy the make and therefore welcome i the that commissioner patten here is do we i i less than we can to this barbaric practice to end
let we from this parliament already the possible do
the   are the  words there will or in programmes people heart or between the people peace well as the death not vote is declared
you said in your speech that not can be guaranteed that the the out the the death never mistakes be made
any execution is a mistake
i am  but i read the bible and the the that no  something must the do also already has he are brother  killed
any execution is a mistake the incompatible is with the democracy the protection the the human and the human dignity
mr the president i  started what commissioner patten to say had with particularly when he referred the are personal experience and are vision on the absurd the a punishment the a growing number citizens in the world still less immediately if a effective deterrence
the the outside doubt that europe important progress has made in its own commitment the culture the the death and the right the life be solemn the in the draft the the fundamental there is a nevertheless provision on the  the the death for already who rapprochement looking to the european enlargement the number instruments in the relations with third countries the with the clause on the human to and to finally is there there the a moratorium the the death that the council if priority can into in the common foreign and security
when our international institutions when the court in den hague a criminal must condemn if  the very serious crimes the are cronies has and if we that type terrible crimes compare with what crime than also which in very what countries even democratic countries thousands people currently the the death wait than aware we perhaps that what agree a european religious was other the refusal to the death from to to creation can funds to the standard in the political institutional and humanitarian behaviour in all parts the the world
this disposition than also the new europe the the third millennium
therefore president question i the commissioner patten a clearly answer the the question or the commission prepared is the amendments the the budget the the european union the amendments the our group the the european liberal and democratic party the the budget the has tabled good to use
there is namely not there the a institutional initiative if there not extremely cooperation with the ngos programmes is
i i you for commissioner to to see or europe not european day against the death in the world can introduce that would a relevant contribution are the this growing universal aware that increasingly increasing in the cradle the the civilisation the europe is and like continue
mr the president the group the free european alliance is a convinced favour the the resolution the tomorrow on the moratorium the the death will be adopted
time the march presented mrs oversteps oversteps in the european parliament the first important report on this issue the called they for a moratorium the the death which in un had be decided
eight year later as also in our resolution the stressed is the situation serious and worrying but the international mobilising for the moratorium the constantly to
this is than also the given where we the from must to despite that the un recently a only the the place has made therefore is the matter that we benefit draw the the resources the with the budget available are the
although had a moratorium the over executions the in the last years in iraq are done not blocked and nor the thousands executions in china but in other countries in the first place the united states the only large democracy the still with persistent proud the death remains apply start this difficult process the mobilising for the moratorium only diffidently effects to there
régime bush in whose the executions have place is the managed the  the the death from the campaign to delete and he was as  and hypocritical to the executions in are the the to suspend to after the elections that is however certainly a the the many proof the the cynical way which the with the kind plays and there currency from seeks to we
although is the often to people the guilty are were but they be however but good for the allow the the cynical  politician odds
therefore must we our way prosecute with same conviction and perseverance the mrs oversteps the the day complex when they the association no must the  to 
perhaps to we the not immediately for other but we confidence that that the us manage this objective to achieve also with the money that the the budget this is allocated and with the assistance the the commission
mr the president gentlemen colleagues according the universal statement the the rights the the human the the united nations has everyone the right the life and freedom
all member the the un have the compulsory this statement in eight to take
the death is a irrevocable breach the the right the life and is always appalling inhumane and demeaning
only already in the year are in the united states people 
there is a long list with countries where the death the place or where the death the imposed that happening example in china iran and iraq
although in turkey the death since not more is place are there least people the death condemned
the turkish parliament has the last floor on the implementation the the court and must the still on dossiers the
that is not acceptable certainly not for a country that to the european union like join
turkey must the death abolish to in the european union to be included
what is the had the the death
as the death there trying the already rearguard the to show that the need is
now intervene those the the death especially back the the argument the the deterrent force
they say that after the abolition the the death the number heavy criminals rising
no the world can however the least proof for the assertion be found
how is example to explain that the number murders in the usa where the death still always the applied considerably higher is than in countries where the death is abolished
the any execution can the also to a innocent to there are many cases know which innocent are condemned
especially poor and members the groups be  often to the death condemned
behind the wellknown the the death you a  the in a civilised country not does
or the now is to abu jamal in the usa to öçalan in turkey or the real execution the    in iraq already this judgments must be condemned
i consider the death if a barbaric
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president just as the treaty the amsterdam and the european charter the the fundamental has this parliament the repeated times against the death expressed unfortunately there as already is said the death still in many countries the world in countries with a antidemocratic tradition as the communist china but also in countries with a extremely liberal system as the united states
we know how difficult the is abolition the this excessive and inhumane punishment to achieve
the is even difficult in america where as mrs frassoni just horrified those the the institutions represent and the the political result draw the not in their head to for abolition the the death to favour because they otherwise electorate lose
the statement is for the hand given the increase the the organised crime the the death as if a form the deterrence to a any increase the crime and other illegal activities against to the
we know however that the best not as in the area is we know that the death a at measure is a type  
the fight against the crime must although relentlessly and insubordinate are but they must the basis the the right done and at be the social action this fight must very certainly not in the sign are the only but repression or still worse the the logic view to view handtomouth to handtomouth
the must also a together campaign for the human be launched where everyone the involved can be the high to low the those the a political or institutional role role to the ordinary citizens especially also the young citizens than can the the necessary awareness for this issue them and political pressure exercise the the countries the this punishment still in their legislation have
also already letter i for naïve to be member like i like proposals that the european states refuse  to maintain with countries the the death still still apply
i aware however the that this a utopia the the height is is i think with particularly the china that as the commissioner also already said any day the a death opinion and in the general very what to late the the the compliance the the human but unfortunately also a extremely  trading is where our european countries absolutely not outside can
i join the this campaigns against the death will more to more and  are as we there if institution in will succeed our citizens also the feeling to give that we all with same determination and efficiency work the the construction the a safe europe a europe where terrible criminal practices as the trade in drugs resources trafficking exploitation and paedophilia as soon possible from the way overcome can be
mr the president already those the not young member more are or their first mandate already behind the back have can this debate not initiate without with emotion back to think the mr oversteps oversteps as intended frassoni just was
they was the because who the time in a beginning was with this long fight which we still still terms are
precisely because i reporting because i look to the progress the since is made mr the commissioner can i i at not find in your vision and in the positive assessment the you the on the fact that the union the resolution the in november in un was tabled has withdrawn
the verbal inflexibilities which the a compromise on you should the good the preamble refused has while that compromise the the measure itself nothing  danger in fact a substantial given to hide the has the end exactly that done where a whole series already than not friendly large powers the from were the because their  had up when they the this initiative concerned
not that as such response now as new was in he europe already divided on a resolution the italy but precisely therefore is the all still worse
this was namely absolutely feasible
i repeat therefore for i is here there the a missed opportunity
this geared mr the commissioner believe i that precisely the this type issues a joint action the the organisations the in the society work and the ngos programmes a fundamental point is normally are this because organisations the a greater margin have they can more  and dare positions to defend the if the were less bound are the other views or interests what how rightly also governments and institutions there often to to water in the wine to do
precisely with the view this the in a part the the resolution asked that the commission  the in its reporting and there transparent information is on how the lines on the year be used for this problem and for the democratisation in wider sense
the is namely the agree happened and the happening still still that precisely organisations the the the most for this problem working off be the cooperation with the commission despite that the organisations already years the that level are are to apparently because there not money more is or because the money simply somewhere otherwise is happened
therefore believe i mr the commissioner that transparency and information our common efforts the good will to where to my feeling everyone benefit the has
mr the president we must the commission and the presidentinoffice presidency the the council grateful are that they this important subject to a the the priorities the this months have become especially now the european council as mrs díez already said just the charter the the fundamental the the european union has 
as already was said are the pictures the the american campaign and the last debate between the two main candidates us still clear for the spirit the candidate the the democrats has the public confirmed that the only point the agreement with are opposed is that they both for the death are
i think the important that the european union the campaign the abolition the the death argument because this a campaign the favour the the human dignity and the most fundamental the all fundamental is
i think that we as you rightly has said mr the commissioner the the up the the foreign policy the the european union with the to the third countries must think that in a statement the the the treaty the amsterdam is our clear the said that a country the death must have abolished before the member can be the the european union
i think than also that we in our relations with third countries very clear must are and not should hesitate the countries the the the us position to to terms
we must therefore the action the the commission support by a appropriate programming by effective to work to to and especially also by if european union the a recognisable clear and transparent way the to act the must be worked with the nongovernmental organisations mrs bonino pointed this the the this area many authority have and many can contribute
mr the president i think that the institutions the values the our civilisation must europe and that our citizens the must can recognise in the ethical mirror the we they by us work hear for to the
mr the president mr the commissioner if any petition that we in this parliament have dealt and approved a kind worth would are would i in my  are
unfortunately was and is that however not as
we must see to prevent that our speeches and our  reactions into in a  because while we our indignation express to others by with deaths
what we therefore this parliament the commission and the council questions is a healthy form the dismay we must there behind see to to how we the necessary influence can exercise so the death not humiliation remains for the whole humanity
that is the importance the the current resolution
there are two points the to us insight extremely manageability are
in the first place must the abolition the the death or the moratorium this a absolute priority continue in the relations with third countries this must not condition are to friendship but a condition to political economic and underpin
if second point that by you mr the commissioner very good is raised and where many mr programmes the have revalorises must the commission the sensible way use make the its financial resources and campaigns support which the think around the death in the society can be amended
as mr salafranca as about said was the at which both candidates for the first the the united states said agreement to to with the death a embarrassing you during the debate for the presidential
we are other children the   and would like see that this legacy not limited but to the geography the europe
hence the need specific actions from to to the support the the ngos programmes the support the the society and the who but the necessary courage the this area know the to to as mr bonino rightly said
just mr the commissioner urge i the the commission the the a effort form the dismay
the council question i are voice to let hear the our governments
this parliament question i the courage not the to give and never to silent on this problem
mr the president any day be there people the death condemned and executed
the is even and almost not to believe that this quadragesimo still still place
as a number colleagues already has said which the most italians were but that is i i not characterise is for the horror the we feel is the a labour punishment a punishment the a indeed society worthy is and always the risk with the of that innocent people condemned be
china the over the the list what the the number executions i and other members have us in the parliament been with china
today like i my attention however up the the united states
on two weeks find this presidential place and george bush can the next president are a man the are permission the executions has granted
include were the legal event and minors
in least one the this cases was the to a mental disabled child
this is terms and scandalous and very harmful for the democratic reputation the the united states
with the view the the  is the the large important that we now in the parliament our if express
i support the i the proposal the mr rutelli for the organisation the a european day against the death
mr the president between hinges intentions and practical action is a shadow in the case the the death is the the shadow the the geopolitical and economic interests
your position here today is many further than hinges intentions
you had the on the lines for the year for the finance the campaigns the for the the abolition the the death
good
the shadow is there however still still
where i the objective commissioner patten is the next the euro the the commission has invested are mainly to   international has a legal organisation the the address the the caribbean islands and to the university the westminster the a database and research available the the lawyers in  the the philippines
i like the commission therefore urge to the use the appropriations more to up the the two most countries where  often and with  the carried the republic china and the united states the america
course know we the that this issue ritual and the periodically times the raised the the governments the both countries but we must many more do
for what the the united states would there example money must be invested in campaigns in europe course is the the not the intention to a sovereign the if texas to they but the to the european tourism and the european industrial investment to to lead to the states the such barbaric practices not know
president i am personally to different reasons not favour the the death and however like i here two fundamental comments make the from the already what here for i already is said
in the first place think i should however not  with  be compared
there is a macedonia difference between the implementation the the death in example the united states one and in countries if china pakistan telling north to there but a few from a long list to mention hand
in the first place is the to the highest punishment for the  criminals the also on very many  in the democratic trials have can have
in the other cases is the usually to a type arbitrary at intimidation against  after not only heavy criminals the legal
who this everything on one same exacerbates the practised 
in the second place must i however also say that the easy is to in democratic states tired to vienna to the fate the heavy criminals
the is already something difficult to the the fate the to draw the the those example the old people the be  for their  the   the  be  by  the children the be there and killed
if i that convinced are that in europe the like there to the over everything the fate the the victims and the safety the the victims the to draw than would i here today with you and without reservations the death condemn
i can only but in the practice the certainly in my country that the  criminals systematically early be released and not rarely again at crime committed
the is in the circumstances not surprising that many people say that the death for some  monsters very what innocent lives had can save
mr the president mr the commissioner the the first face seems this debate that a repeat is the previous debates  and not topical
a debate on the death is however a debate which the the based the a by the right include civilisation this late europe the by inspiration
however is this debate topical and important look you but to what in the world happening
the is important that this debate the held by the parliament the europe the western because europe has a  tradition a the the romans way tradition a tradition the the european legal culture and with particularly the the italy and germany has affected and the modern way the the new rights has demonstrated a tradition the common law the back to the bill or rights the england
despite the very tragic moments in europe there are fascist and communist regimes been the the  and rights under the footing have got must i i this parliament never fail on the death to speak and any form of mr to condemn i believe that the charter the the fundamental that currently in treatment is and which in nice a decisive at successfully especially is motivated by this gentlemen by the gentlemen the the human by the gentlemen the the right by the gentlemen the the right the freedom
we italians to the the tradition the   whose name here already is mentioned but i believe that  europe belongs he has the whole kind and  right refused
he wanted a modern right a legal the us  for the    and through a civilised society freedom guarantees the death the the peace in a civilised society always far way
we must the courage have to to say that a country only really democratic is if the the death ensure acceptance the a moratorium enough not how important this also may are
indeed humanitarian efforts enough not i i must the godlike to that the death outside the law the
president in was  cent the all executions in the world place in only five countries china iran telling the democratic republic congo and the united states
the is course precisely that the european union the death within its borders not allow
the death is the most cruelty  and labour punishment
they violates the right the life the is you and can the have the innocent people
also is never proven that the crime better sight than a other form the punishment
there is just said that there in the united states perhaps a better trials is or that there also the very  crimes can be committed
but that is course exactly the point
we can us also if authorities not reduce to the level the the criminals the we penalties
that is group exactly the  the we here in europe have achieved and that is the  which we the must the and therefore support we the i the policy the commissioner patten
mr the president the is the highest time that we a universal moratorium the the death or the administrative murder as   the mentioned introduce
that i i already last october said when we a urgency disability which we execution the the american black journalist jamal abu jamal wanted prevent
what is the current the the affairs states as the death still always if a appropriate answer the certain crimes
in were people executed in countries and currently are there least the death condemned in countries
the life the jamal depends in pending the a any revision the are process more than ever the the the international solidarity
what place will the european union adopt in the fight for the abolition the the death now the twentieth century is has
jamal abu jamal has when he the in stage the the  was this courageous message passed stage that is stage the the fight
we will win
certainly there are hope want the that point that the global level the opponents the the death area win
both the united nations if the european parliament take now part the the debate this debate is need and the all areas the the society are
in the united states itself the the public opinion still always very positive the the death but is they however the the doubt the
as has the university the  demonstrated that on a period the twenty year mistakes are made in almost the the executions
the kill innocent and there is the the application the the death clear there the racism
the  the the governor the texas and the republican candidate for the constituency house is regular the stage the demonstrations against the death
the european union must already its weight in the scale to to this moratorium the to force and the if a inviolable principle the to to the all nations the this  the victor  already a shocked for the human conscience mentioned still always apply
administrative year after the abolition the the death in france be there now initiatives taken for the postpone the a national day for a universal moratorium the the death
i am there favour the that we this proposal the european level present
the december next will there hundreds  be sent the the united nations
the presidency the the union would the also can working for this campaign and the the those the abolition the necessary support and a timetables in the back can give
the involvement the europe is the crucial important
mr the president i will this just briefly summarise in the hope that the parliament i not wrong understand if i first something like correct
we to here not with other compete in humanitarianism i feel i least as involved the this subject if many member the this parliament i i in discussions least as often if some members the this parliament on this subject about perhaps even more than many in this parliament
if  took i already the such discussions part and later during my political career i i speeches taken the universities
i i part the radio and television programmes and am because my position  during public meetings on the death
i i in the parliament on the death about and i my opposition during high face discussions on terrorism on terrorist attacks and the death
for i is this debate here a completely unique experience
i i still never earlier the a debate on the death part which everyone the same on was that is something which we the just should consider
the gentlemen member has in a excellent and moving speech referred to  and 
the bible is in discussions on this subject more abused and i mean this not to say that the gentlemen member the bible here has abused than what other text than also perhaps with exception the 
usually to we a another quote from the bible to hear usually hear we the fresh on view to view and handtomouth to handtomouth
the text the as often quoted that the a  the gentlemen member still further back to hear to to 
many further be you not back
i request the parliament after to think on the fact that all speakers in this debate the same on were the a on where i the enough that agree am
i concerned from the that we not only our mind must let to on public campaigns in other countries but also on the need to within the european union permanent public campaigns to to i am there namely not the convinced that everyone outside this wonderful walls outside this parliament there just as on think if we
we should also not forget that the a the the tasks the the political is to influence from to exercise the the public opinion and there not taken the from to to that everyone the with us agree is
the proposal the the mr rutelli to a european day the our course to to a day which we us time again against the death express think i excellent and very efficient that is under the area where i the on had
if i the not with the gentlemen member agree am is my first response that i the than probably the the the wrong end i
the disagreement on the general sitting the the un the only the tactics
us objective the medium term the the a successful resolution and the general sitting the the un against the death
this there not doubt on
we were last year the opinion that we not the objective could achieve that we wanted achieve that the risk large was that there end a resolution would be adopted which i the content completely disagree would are been and which the gentlemen member the according i also completely disagree would are been a resolution namely which would to to are that the one country the not must interfere with the human in a other country
we would than have given that the  simply would be abused to to the conclusion to to
we want a good and clear text which the death the rejected and the referred to the universal validity the the human with including the the inviolability the the human life
we want build the what achieved is in the human and as the majority create the we like in the united nations itself would want see
there is occasions about on countries where the death excessive often in appalling numbers even the carried
there is about on china and we know all the situation this
this is a issue the we in our dialogue time again to the to
i certainly not with the hand the the heart and even not without the hand the the heart to say that the many usefulness has but we continue the issue raise
also the the united states insist we the the issue the
in the united states have we last february a general brings taken addition the  the the individual  example with the view the individual cases the the death
we have the united states called a moratorium the the wellknown the the death in to to that must end lead to overall abolition the the death
we have there the the united states the the their reservations the the article the the international treaty on rights and political rights on the ban the the death for minors in to draw
also have we the united states called in to vote with the strict conditions including the death must be used this are in different international agreements down
a or two members have out the the 
they mr the the fact that both the republican if the democratic candidate the already their mutual  extent the the government taxation moral standards in the public life the on a thing agree are the death
perhaps are they the indeed agree on the death and perhaps say they that the death efficient and moral even justified is because they that actually believe
the most american politicians and officials seem there as on to think but sometimes is the also as that officials elected officials certain positions adopt because they think that the popular are
perhaps must we still just  the the point on the public information also the issue to the to in what perhaps the best informed society the world is
the number occasion the number people in the prison in the united states is extremely high for a country that a century ago in such articulated very to are democracy was going by  the 
i question i the what he the the  would have found
i question i the what he would have found the the number death in the united states
this is a useful although pleasant unusual debate been
i hope that we the still agree can repeat
i hope however also that we this debate to outside to will europe and this subject the there will to in  the less united are in their views and wisdom
i hope that we both our intellectual if our financial sources time the time will can working for the inviolability the the human life and the fight the the unacceptable practice the the death
we must us all verheugen the the day that the death the as if a kind form the barbarity because that is the

mission the commissioner patten in serbia
the the item is the communication the the commission on the mission the commissioner patten in serbia
as few gentlemen members perhaps know had i today fact together with javier solana and  hombach the the pact the special summit the the europe leaders in opinion must attend the president  has organised to the return the yugoslavia to the family the europe countries to celebrating
i i president  however let know that i love present was been but today here in this parliament had are to democratic responsibility in the practice to show
i i here to i large pleased now the several debates part
i will than also with pleasure report produce the this parliament on my visit the yugoslavia yesterday and monday
as many here i i excitement awaited to the day which i report would can produce on a such visit and on our attempts links the to connection with a democratic belgrade
many the us were surprised by the continue return the the democracy in serbia in the last weeks
in fact would the us course not should surprised that the democracy end however formula
the european union has for the elections the exactly a month ago clearly clear made that democratic changes in yugoslavia would lead to a radical change the the attitude the the european union the that country
what can there in a month many change
last summer were i in this parliament report from on a serbia that a  was under the european countries on a serbia which the courageous independent media were oppressed on a serbia which we the opposition very
the is course still early day but today is the opposition the the government and see the independent media that they suddenly not more isolated are and not more the all sides be attacked but that they the where forms in a new attempt to the creating the truly open and pluralist media for the whole country
from the at that the people in serbia their democratic ability clear have made and respect of have called has the european union are floor fulfilling done
scarcely four days after the democratic revolution the october  the european ministers the foreign affairs the that the sanctions were lifted and the  and  immediately were withdrawn
they  also the that the european bureau for reconstruction was extended to serbia and montenegro
they value our willingness to progress to make with the up the the danube and this resources available to to
they asked the commission to proposals to do for enlargement to very yugoslavia the our only ago announced preferential regulations for the balkans
they very the wish that the member as soon possible the diplomatic relations with yugoslavia would restore or would undeniable
they were the willingness the the european union to a contribution to make the the institutional and economic restoration the the  and  president kostunica from to the informal meeting the the european council in biarritz the to live and part to take the the by the presidency organised regional summit the november in zagreb where the croatian government kickstart will are
the day after the meeting the the ministers the foreign affairs flew minister védrine if representative the the presidency to belgrade to president kostunica personally to inform on the measures the the european union had decided order the during the campaign the the population the serbia made promises fulfilling to do
still same day just five days after october oclock a team officials the the commission in belgrade to with advisers the president kostunica to negotiate on a package asylum the short term
later in the week proposed the european commission the european council in biarritz for the correspondingly including this parliament to questions in to vote with a  the for the serbia the gentlemen the million euro which million from the emergency would must be taken
in the last few days is a team the us bureau for the reconstruction in belgrade been to in close cooperation with the team the president kostunica and with particularly with professor  and the  the economists as with other donors after to to what aid we exactly can give and how we ensure can ensure that the aid the next weeks as soon possible the serbian soil ends given the regulation winter and the next elections for the serbian republic the december
after this introductory missions am i monday itself to belgrade left and i i yesterday podgorica visited
in belgrade had i a meeting with president kostunica and a individual meeting with as such mayors the democratic hell
i i also a visit the the the were the the  and the courageous independent journalist   met the by milosevic imprisoned was the because he the truth said president kostunica has him only ago released
i had also a meeting with professor  are mr programmes the the  the economists and with mr programmes the the world to to talk on both  if also the more  but  task the the reconstruction and on with particularly the institutional construction and the strengthen the the rule
i i a meeting had with the mayor the belgrade and with him a school visited the the  in the framework the the programme schools for democracy the the european commission
i i a visit the the the independent  a type refuge for independent journalists that also is supported by the european commission and i this a interview given
also i i a visit the the the studio the the independent television and outlet b that been has ago under harassment the milosevic and also was supported by the european commission if we the history the the last weeks in serbia to book to should we not fail the independent journalists here a received reference to give
they have at many more courage shown than i ever i need to show
also i i important meetings had with representatives the the democratic opposition the serbia with ngos programmes and representatives the the civil including with   the impressive leader the the alliance the democratic citizens
i i report issued the the heads the the european union for i to montenegro left where i last meetings had with president  and prime 
i like just briefly like the my meeting with president kostunica and the package emergency which we currently the last hand to
i i president kostunica explained that we the plan are serbia as soon possible to aid to support
i was under the impression the are democratic ability and am i fully aware become the the enormous challenge the him now waiting he must now the democracy in serbia see to consolidate with particularly in the runup to the serbian elections
i i him clear made that we prepared are as many possible to help
i  the approach the he in biarritz and during are recent visit the sarajevo had elected with particularly are willingness to immediately diplomatic relations the to connection with bosnia and through
you has perhaps are statements this heard in a recent interview for expressed
i think that president kostunica a impressive start has made given the extremely difficult circumstances the only few under us a few months ago could for
he deserves a certain extent the political ability the the tackle the the problems and the consolidate the are position we must him however also all practical aid offer the we meet can to
therefore have we quickly action and a extensive  for serbia up
our priorities are in close coordination with the democratic leaders in belgrade up and there from the  the especially energy medicines and possible also food
with same package will we also us extremely successful programme schools for democracy to enlargement the to we since few months fundamental improvements from in schools the by the opposition future hell
this to we now in very serbia do
we to a new programme launch was hell for democracy the must the most necessary improvements the the  possible be and more support be granted the the media and the civil in this critical stage
the is clear that serbia a enormous difficult winter meet is especially the the area the energy
we will everything in the work must to to the problems to alleviate but the will how than also been be milosevic has serbia programmes new leaders damage with a less 
the energy want we us programme energy for democracy enlargement to very serbia
we want especially diesel and oil introduce both to the  behaviour to the if to  the fuel to for
we will mainly through the hell operate as we that also last year have done during the first initiative in the framework the energy for democracy
i i a particularly useful meeting had with president kostunica and a large number mayors to on the priorities to talk
hope am i the managed clear to make with what a enormous task we faced be
we will with others must work serbia is a difficult period meet how we us also will make
we do us effort best to the aid as quickly possible the serbian soil to to that will probably from the second half the november the case are
the population the serbia know that they the now the the not more only the that they can count the solid aid the the european union and the rest the the family the european democracies
from my meetings with mayors and others was clear to the that the very high expectations laws the the european union
we should them not disappoint
i hope that there soon agreement can be achieved in the commission and in the  for the programme programmes so deliveries indeed in the second half the november can start
the population the serbia will there not understanding for have if they from being by bureaucracy i fact nor we must really very quickly the the work to
i like however still a another important point stress the aid the i i described is absolutely not the expense the our efforts elsewhere in the region
myself and i i also the ministers in the council general affairs are us particularly aware the the obligations the the european union the regard the croatia bosniaherzegovina albania the fyrom and the population the kosovo and montenegro
our efforts elsewhere in the region will not reducing they will earlier still double
that was a the the reasons why i yesterday a visit were the podgorica my third visit since march for the first could i from belgrade with a visa this go fly
i i us comprehensive programme discussed with president 
we have this year million euro spent for montenegro from gratitude for the fact that montenegro despite the pressure the the milosevic the last three year bold the democratic way has followed
i i the president and the prime the the informed the the our plans to the activities the the european bureau for reconstruction to montenegro from to extend and i them in the framework the the as welcome democratic change in belgrade informed on our proposals to the total proceeds the our only ago how asymmetric measures for the region from to extend to montenegro and also serbia
this will a large incentive mean for the economy in montenegro
i i listened to the views the the prime and the president on the recent developments and on the relations between montenegro and serbia
i i them and the press clear made that i under the impression was the president kostunica programmes democratic ability and the enormous challenge the him waiting the the consolidate the the democracy
also i i said that the european union already the possible will do to to help and that we therefore work the a has package asylum for the winter
say if friend the montenegro said i that if elected democratic leaders their hand in friendship  the the large important is this to accept
i up my view that now milosevic way is the fulfilled problems can be resolved with a rational and  dialogue which understanding the shown for allow positions and demonstrated the given the a certain proposing the spirit and patience
this are attributes the the last decade in the region not always in broad extent present are been and than pressure i i very soft from
i share that there now a generation leaders the the power is the the things the a other way like tackle
late i today end with to say that this year started with democratic changes in zagreb and we there this autumn witness the were how the much  democratic change root could support in belgrade
there must still many be done
although i believe that democracy irreversible is is the democracy in serbia still young and fragile
now have we the best perspectives for a generation to sustainable peace and prosperity the to build in very europe a opportunity to last really a progress to to under the traumatised programmes the the recent past and to the future to look a future in europe
the european union is ready for this task they the ready to everything to do what in its power is to the expectations where to make the already those whose lives damaged are by the atrocities the the milosevic both within if outside the serbian borders
the is a huge challenge but this is the challenge where we all as long for have work
now is the our duty to this challenge the to to
president late i start with the commissioner to thank that he as quickly to belgrade been is and that he this as quickly report the does in the parliament
normal about think i that that the task is the commissioners and not normal about must be said that i the this a exception like make for the fact that he that here now does
the previous time that we the on serbia had i i the colleagues called any patience to have with the mr kostunica because my impression was that there almost per day progress was and i think that we can see that the progress there is to and with yesterday when the mr kostunica the prepared has declared responsibility to take and that think i very important responsibility for the serbian crimes in kosovo
very specific i i three questions the the commissioner
has he about with the mr kostunica on the position the the kosovar refugees
as know are there approximately still thousand people without only were the this at in serbian prisons
the rumoured is that this quickly something the done is be
i was hear or he this still further information on had
the second question is on kosovo
i am the with him agree with what he here said has on montenegro but the next the problem is course what to do with kosovo
third question the finally the money
very good that there emergency is
is the commissioner that convinced that the million the there maximum for next year will are enough is to serbia next year structural to help
mr the president mr the commissioner my thank for what you here has said i am the fully with you agree
i would approximately same have said only pressure i i otherwise from than you
when i two weeks ago with mr swoboda in serbia was i i exactly same experience gained
we were there however not for the mr hombach but because we enough money have to the people this to help
the mr hombach is there only go has to are face to let see and the to to what there possibly can be done
we know what there can be done and the does i pleased that we the this necessary money tomorrow available can to
i know certainly that the emergency under your stability also really quickly will be granted
the can the commission let see that they the better does than the they
i like still two questions to
in the first place has the mr modrow night said that we this only but the damage the the nato restore
i i when against him said that this nonsense is because the the damage by socialist than the communist mismanagement is caused
i like you questions or you this can confirm
in the second place was us when we two weeks ago the ground were told that the sanctions were lifted but the are not lifted
how is the with the trade
has you that problem now resolved
the companies this must now the opportunity to trade to introducing
i would say the you the from the milosevic the a black list but the you everyone the this not the the the free hand
mr the president mr the commissioner the dramatic  the the yugoslav president kostunica where also the mr reference the was are mea mea and the mea mea the the croatia people something that we the other nations never have seen forms a gesture that him to honour credit the the a important contribution made the the improvement the the atmosphere in this area
in political respect agrees kostunica the therefore behind the decisions the the international community the international community as kosovo still still if a part the the yugoslav federation and the the a proceeding the the hope the the albanians in kosovo the independence
what for a type tension how paradox us the tension also may seem even with a partial return the the serbian refugees can the result are the the long achieve but missed opportunity the the albanians the selfdetermination
can you i mr the commissioner after your discussions say in what extent according you the moderate rugova prepared is a dialogue to start with the democratic mr in belgrade
last year the this time i i a visit the the belgrade a quite  city the daily across and again  between hope and despair
i i this the ngos programmes visited the the deal with humanitarian aid and media and money received the the european union
what i this however looked vote i not the to 
the intentions were good but the circumstances not the promise was there but there was nothing from because the money not reached and there administrative  was
i like the commissioner questions to to confirm that he the staff the the commission that in brussels but with particularly also in the office in belgrade under leadership the michael graham the leader working will thank they have during this whole period with enormous changes to make had and in fact have they considerably contributed the the process in the direction the more democracy
they have all difficulties the sorry something  achieved
i like the commissioner ask to confirm and he not only this people but also the ngos programmes the ground will thank
i hope especially also that he the thank the this parliament like accept he has demonstrated that democratic motto not only in prc effect has but also in serbia
also i like the commissioner like thank for are efforts and without presumptuous to want are believe i him to should assure that the low presence in this parliament not reflects is the the extent the interest for this subject
between two only according i true there something not with the procedures the this parliament if we during the whose half at must vote and than not in the be the with sufficient people accordance the extent the interest present to are the the debate on a such important subject
i i a question on the regional cooperation
meeting the commissioner and make we if european union progress the our attempts the involved in the region that to convince that us insist the regional cooperation not  is but a step the the way to a possibly membership the the eu know they that we their way to europe not want block geared course that they meet the all criteria without deadlines and timetable programmes
mr the president i like the have on kosovo because on would your communication the is changed in a communication on serbia today fact must to
i i this understanding for because there a new leader is president kostunica and you with him in consultation must act to this process as good possible to let has
i was previous week in pristina
this i i a many people met and especially also a credibility had with bernard kouchner
i i can see what for enormous problems there are
indeed you had the on the danube but we can us not content with the out the studies
there must urgent actions be taken i think also the the pollution the the danube the is started in the near the mitrovica with the  the 
there must a plan on risk to for this region but also for pristina and other cities in kosovo
the population live in large need
by the attacks with  are pristina and the other affected areas been polluted
the the destruction the the  is there asbestos other that the on the whole city has distributed
there is a serious problem
this wanted i your attention draw as the the social problems
there must urgent support be given the the social action the the widows the being etc
there must urgent measures be taken
that wish i to emphasise
i am my gentlemen friend grateful for are words on michael graham and are staff in belgrade
they have excellent work done
to my large pleased i i few the them can thank but hope can i them during my next visit all thank i will also certainly the praise pass the the gentlemen member
the organisations the your have the good done
as are we the excellent way times by the swedish  we have more general good worked and despite all obstacles the were raised by the regime milosevic have we very what aid can received the democratic respond people and organisations in serbia
hope has this a modest role can play in the through the the changes
the gentlemen member has there rightly the out that us insist the regional cooperation sometimes the suspicion gives that brussels the the way obstacles like raise the way to europe
we must the people explain that we in europe exactly that want achieve which we know that the working
the european union is the best example the world the countries the to make have had with old ceasefire the countries the end greater political stability and prosperity have know to achieve by borders and obstacles to overcome certain sovereign rights to pool and things together to do the they together simply better could do
we want the countries the europe encourage same to do
we say example against them we give you over access to our markets but than must you also you neighbouring over access give to you markets
that is the core the the stabilisation and process that now slowly but certainly fit
for what the the danube and the environment and health am i the agree with what the gentlemen member has said
president kostunica said during the meeting with few mayors that yugoslavia in the new democratic age still very what work for the go has the the area the gender mainstreaming there were the the meeting believe i but three women present
a the this women mayors were specific the issue to raised the the environment and warnings the the last year are the we will us with this type problems must deal because they for many people in europe a serious threat for the health forms
thank you the mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
climate floods
the the item is the joint debate on
the report a the the mr  da  behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the communication the the commission on the policy and the measures the the eu to the emissions the greenhouse back to insist to a european programme on climate  com c cos
the report a the the mr  da  behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the green the the commission on the trade in  within the european union com c cos
the oral question b the mrs jackson the the commission behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the strategy the the commission for the sixth conference the den hague on climate 
the statement the the commission on the floods in northern and spain
mr the president gentlemen members we subjects not if we now eight year after rio and three year after kyoto the that the treatment the the issue climate the this at in a critical stage start to out we can even say that the at the truth is time and the to two reasons
also is the as that we the internal level not converge but contrary still further the other from are with the to the promises the we in kyoto have done on the reduce the the emissions that is very simple the result the the fact that the member have failed a policy and measures the to to the the area the example efficient energy the promotion the renewable energy the taxation the energy and greenhouse
only therefore already must we the initiative the the commission to a green to present welcome same applies for the communication the the commission to a european programme on climate
we will quickly enough can the that the proposals itself only changes need and not inappropriate accepted properly to be but nevertheless to there the this initiatives two undeniable political signals from
to outside to the the movement the the european union stressed to within be  about
we start with a analysis the the green on the trade in 
this green is the the been for the debate on the way which the trade in  in the future must be structured
to the system the the to to has the commission a number conditions formulated a type hard core the system must based are the a approach which already some learnt the the must in the start to and the must in the first stage limited continue to carbon and the large polluters
the up the a such system for the european union and than already from has according us undeniable benefits that is from the report clear to the
i will three the this benefits explain
in the first place can the with a such system in the practice learn while the different economic sectors companies and the member itself in the opportunity be the the for to prepare the the year the year which the system for the trade in  the force the
in the second place makes this system the easier to in to intervene in case the noncompliance noncompliance is the this at in the most member the standard
the third can with this system the costs the resulting from the implementation the the in kyoto commitments obligations considerably be reduced and the with billions euro programmes per year
this is a good initiative and the green is the good quality we are the commission this thank owe a number points the however the a already to limited way dealt
the objective the this report there there than also in the by the green probably debate to strengthen and from to extend
that is our task
the you i to that i six the the points highlighted
one the green had quantified objectives must set for the reduce the greenhouse through the system the 
two the can are that the system the trade in greenhouse the favour the nuclear working
three the is according us the fundamental important that the system in the future also will apply for a number sectors the now not under the system the
four the commission has in the debate on the  the the system the trade in greenhouse companies if only option appropriate
there are namely also other options and we hope that the commission now also all another options in recital will take
five the is according us essential that the countries as soon possible be included in the system for the trade in greenhouse
we to the commission therefore the to in a next communication a plan for to to which indicated the the what way this countries in the system can be integrated to finally point six the way which the  be spent
the requested  can according us many easier through a auction than through  success be a auction is also a many easier system the that the competition not distorts
we can the this at however still not few method out reason why we the commission ask to on the by us mentioned option after to think and also a third benchmarking in eligible to take
than look we now to the communication on the european programme for climate
the green on the trade in greenhouse witness the commitment and is quality good the compared is the communication to a european programme on climate the communication on the to to policy and the to take measures certainly disappointing to mention
disappointing because the communication policymaking and the take the measures the the second plan the actions the national or community level be because subordinate made the mechanisms the communication the also disappointed because the capture economic sectors a unequal treatment the part is
we had expect that the sectors the not are included in the system for the trade in greenhouse least in the communication on the to to policy and the to take measures the a sound way dealt would be with clear established objectives we ask the commission therefore to the european programme for climate the  as soon possible to border
the commission must six months after the  a very package measures and put submit which for any sector a policy and measures be the the must than time also exactly be indicated what terms given the objectives are with the to the reduce the the emissions the greenhouse
with your regarding like i you very record something tell on the next conference the the united nations the  the in november in den hague taken will be
the difficulties where the  that to make will to are not only the result the the complexity the the problems the in kyoto not are resolved they have also to make with what there in the united states happening
to the just who the american elections gaining bill clinton and already  will how than also those are the in den hague to negotiate on the protocol the kyoto
what there than is follow is worrying
gaining bush can the are that already the by the from in den hague badly agreements by the new government simply ignored be
even if  gaining means that still not that he without problems the two third majority in the senate take the he need has for the ratification the the protocol
i believe therefore that the european union the must the the its 
the is good  and we must with the agenda continue work
if we that not do to with the united states to a achieve to can to risk we a double defeat we having the protocol and that  protocol can than also still agree not ratified be by the united states
precisely therefore must we say that there area is for a opening in the direction the russia canada japan norway and the central and eastern countries
i decision mr the president with a floor the thank the all mr programmes and than in the particularly the the rapporteurs for opinion and the  they are the managed a consensus to find with the to the strategy the we must follow if we the climate a stop want drain

president the emissions the greenhouse the still still to while the european union the to compulsory has to the emissions the this gases in the period with eight cent back to insist
against this background must we the green for the trade in shelves see
the green is a first step in the direction the a indisputable instrument that the emissions the a ceiling unites and the term very efficient and effective opportunities offers to the emissions back to insist
the this way is there a opportunity that the european union however its obligations on the  its
the economic and monetary commission the in large lines positive the the green
the importance they large important the a sound model the the  the must simple and transparent are for the participants and for be the good 
otherwise is the losing by a lack the confidence the operators
also must the system for the involved companies  are
the this point have we large any against few paragraphs in the for us present resolution because the send the the distortion the competition because the  approach not consistent the implemented
the approach the the rapporteur has to result that companies from same sector in the reform member wrong can be dealt
a  compete now once not with a  but the with  from other member
with a number amendments hope i that this misunderstanding corrected can be
i am hear or commissioner wallström they also supports
president the final objective is a cleaner environment
that can by the release the  shelves be achieved without directly in to intervene in the economic structures
finally properly we our collective responsibility to the creation the god responsible to manage without therefore after to to
mr the president mrs the commissioner i like first the rapporteur thank for the fact that he already our positions meet has the and wonderful work has produced
the  was in the  if part the the socalled flexible mechanisms
the european union wanted this fact not the the instruments involve but now are they however in the international treaty and in den hague be now rules up for this socalled flexible mechanisms which the  a the the most is
the european union is to now to the leading force in the international negotiations been and we hope certainly all that the leading position maintained remains the confidence we the the commission
the european union has therefore decided for to to to within the union already from on to to the the trade in greenhouse that is therefore something otherwise than what in the protocol the kyoto the which there is the a such international  from
within the european union can the this system however ideas and develop
therefore welcomes the commission legal affairs and internal market the green the the commission and is welcome with the drafting the a directive the basis of
 the european level is certainly justified because otherwise the competition the balance
i like there the behalf the commission the point that the with  many but not everything can do
the is very important that  other resources authority of are the economic instruments the most
the is also the large important that the  effective the controlled according i have we also environmental need and on negotiate we currently with the council
mr the president gentlemen colleagues also the commission industry external trade research and energy is the opinion that  a sensible solution is
we are the however also with others agree that this to the the total reduction the the emissions must be limited
where the the the  because especially to is is that there in the future not only the electricity and gas a  depends but also the co
that sounds very simple but the is fact the the a total revolution in the  or the energy
that must clear are
this has enormous consequences and i am that convinced that the also the the reduction the the emissions can contribute
how would the speak for the next years look can see
i hope that the european parliament after successful negotiations in den hague the protocol the kyoto will ratify
the the our signature valid
then must the commission a proposal for a directive do which the burden on the member be divided
we have therefore quotas need
the this quotas must however sanctions be linked otherwise have they not sense
otherwise said we to than with a detour through the environmental a common energy
we can in with this  within the european union start
again i hope that this speak less or more will be followed and that we us this not from let to because others perhaps even the united states time not signs
we must the commission the support and the moratorium so possible the
mr the president the is the highest time for a programme the the european commission the reduction the the greenhouse
all the world are climate means in europe have we the the not as bad affected if other areas
i think example the the american western or the bangladesh the recent disasters in italy and in with particularly the  and in switzerland have however let see that the now also the us serious disasters arise where the local population hardly something the can do
what now counts is that the statement the kyoto the into and that the next  in den hague assessments than our efforts to been
now clear is that the climate mainly the co are to due and the movement increasing is the especially the important that there specific proposals be done to the  to to and the through movement the correct way to taxation with particularly by means the  system
what now counts is that there addition the  also measures be taken to the whole process to can control
the is not my intention the mobility the discussion to to or the to the because we have the mobility need we must however the us  change
the  must there however not to lead that we not longer on other specific measures discuss europe is count the the area the the environmental and if we credible want continue must we further to than now in the paper the proposed
mr the president i like the emphatically the concern the the european parliament on the conference the den hague to expression to
as already was said is the here the first to the issue the the participation the members the this parliament
already what in the inconceivable the the conference the den hague in european policy the report must by this parliament discussed amended and approved be
national policy for far this the application is will through the national parliaments must are but for very the european policy that resulting from the conference the den hague must we a voice in the  have
our contribution the the mission is to the date limited to members
also really we fully in the other regarding the role the for our delegation is play
we would like more people send
we know that coreper the next week this going but we would however like the the commissioner hear what the last the the affairs is
further want we like that there before the conference a s the organised for our representatives and they during the conference still the the informed be taken
we will there will more on hear and i hope that the commissioner us debated report will do
that is however still not everything our representatives must present are the all meetings the the mission therefore also the where tactics and policy down be
we believe not that we this the environmental from the can want
given the our role in the european process would the absurd are if the commission and the council us the the negotiations sidelined would to
the second must the the ask in what the industrialised countries including the united states sincerely are what  and the ratification the kyoto the
we must also ourselves the question in all honesty to want they and we really progress make or the everyone the dear in the sand
the proof on the consequences the the climate is  and however were the members the the environment during a recent activities with members the the american congress the impression that the congress not will agree with ratification the kyoto
if the united states even the time the economic growth not can agree with this environmentallyfriendly measures what is there than still to expect in less affront periods
we would like hear what the commission expect the the attitude the the americans in den hague in what extent will the americans the conference sabotage and what would we from the great can save
i that the united states clear express make that they never  never kyoto will ratify without the participation the the most developing what are than the opportunities the the training the a coalition the countries the the ratify and how large is the risk that we the the way the competitiveness the the european union undermine
perhaps can the commission us also a clear timetable give for the plans in the with the next year to take measures the the level the the climate
i free i that the commission us than probably a  must giving in the table the the e environment action programme but this seems i the a appropriate at to the large lines of free to give
since we there to decision reasonable certainly the are that we the causes the the climate know will the future generations us this slow response not forgive
governments governmentrun back for taxes from fear not orderly to be
that is human and perhaps inevitably but we would than however the least more resources can allocate to new renewable energy to develop the quickly a real alternative offer
the is however extremely deplorable that we save the european fund for renewable energy last year precisely being have only a group the the amount that we the  spend is to this fund
future generations will us that not forgive and rightly
late i first and especially the rapporteur mr  da  thank for this two excellent reports on our current strategy the the level the the climate
i think the also very gratifying that the european parliament so important remains attach the the global problem the the climate
the is a good matter that we this today a detailed discussion turn to more this on less than weeks in den hague during the sixth conference the the parties the the convention on climate farreaching decisions must be taken
as you know is the european union a resolutions favour the the force the the  in latest ten year after rio with other words
the is the intention that the european union the protocol ratification as  is implemented in decisions the the  and the credibility the the protocol guarantee
to this to achieve must the european union already the advance the take the presented way to the missions
within this view would i the most objectives the  the the european union if follows want summarise
the first must we ensure ensure that the industrialised countries itself action take
the most emissions the greenhouse take place in the industrialised countries and they must the role take in the fight against the climate
therefore must  result in a balanced distribution between one the use the the  as the trade in shelves and hand the home action the complementarity also must the countries can demonstrate that the policy the reduction the the emissions in results sooner
the second must we ensure ensure that the  be observed
the industrialised countries have a reduction agreed within the framework the the 
to this objective to achieve must  a sound set  for the  that as a being and counterparts system
markets and mechanisms function only than optimum when they are component in a importance institutional framework
the third has the european union in its to the objectives purely to the large any against the into the the socalled  this because the scientific and other uncertainties and risk programmes the this linked are
the union puts also question the the potential extent the the  because the the industrialised countries partially expels the the duty the emissions to reduce
if this any not be lifted can we not agree with the into the additional forestry and familybased otherwise than  deforestation and reforestation
 hear not home the the  the clean  because that a mechanism the that must lead to social and economic development in a country
the fourth must we the developing and the the in transition pertaining economies help by us to up the  the ground transfer the technology and aid the adjustments
in this respect deserve the least developed countries additional attention
we must this points during  further drafting and amount that the clean  based must are the safe environmentallyfriendly technologies which this countries the cleaner can develop
i welcome to that members the the european parliament part of the the community delegation for 
the october will the final decision taken be on the precise number  the commission has proposed that the european parliament by members the represented
this members can the basis the the institutional rules present are the the plenary meetings i can you assure that i and my staff everything in the work will to to the present members regular the the informed to to the the the the the negotiations the not open are for observers
i can you also show that for beginning the  a detailed s taken will be possibly between and november we will try that as good possible to regulate
i like also like the the question on ratification without the united states
the european union importance enormous the ratification and force the the protocol in latest
we insist there the the other parties with particularly the united states and russia time the the that they preparations must take for the ratification
theoretical can the protocol without the participation the the united states the force be but the is certainly not us objective programmes create the producer the greenhouse outside the system to have
this would also probably important consequences have for the competitiveness the the eu
the humanitarian i to know that the commission by the european parliament and the council supported the in its attempts a effective european programme on climate  the to to
the opinion the the commission environment health and consumer on this programme stressed that policy and measures the perspective the the strategy must are
the is important that all involved this strategy support and therefore has the commission in this framework inappropriate for a process which all groups involved are
the environment has briefly ago a number decisions taken on the reduce the the emissions the greenhouse the the choices in the european programme on climate aegean
same is there a number priorities the for the sectors transport efficiency and industry this must further be developed with the view the the  and the costbenefit
this proposals will carefully examined be within the framework the the 
as you know the the programme the the legislators the existing working flexible mechanisms  energy transport industry and research are since june on operational
the  is the from the the a  been the the level the the integration commission the business ngos programmes and national experts had with other to the table
the first impression after this  is absolutely positive
there has a constructive attitude  in the different working
the the special  the november will my introduction based are the a report the this programme
although the programme still young is may the however already a first list to take measures the for all involved sectors
the promotion the joint heat and  and the renewable energy the facilitate the the being to  fuels a effective energy in buildings a awareness in the transport improvements the light commercial measures for these and the recovery the  gases are under other measures the part of the the provisional proposals the the european programme on climate
next summer the the end the the forbids will the  by the new impetus the the principle the existing proposals in a your have the
same will the however new ideas have exacerbated
hence that this programme a unique opportunity offers to all elements meet to to the part must are the a ambitious european strategy against the climate the followup the the commission will the there that the most promising proposals further be developed
i would the members want thank for the broad attention the they spent have the the green on the trade in shelves
the commission has large interest for the positions the the operators and course for the the the european parliament
the is not more than normal that the a new policy the opinions major this where the details the and the does i particularly many pleased that the parliament in this as such constructive attitude has welcome
the trade in shelves is a new concept and lead therefore understandably the some people to mistrust
i hope that the green that mistrust somewhat neutralised has
the trade in shelves within the european union is a as the there addition already the measures the already taken are or currently developed be by the commission within the framework the the 
the commission peer not the one horse
a increase reduction the the emissions requires yes policy and kinds measures
to the discussion within the european union the the to help has the commission a picture outlined the the way which the system would can function
the the here certainly not a final model
perhaps that there from the green a light prefer for certain options clearly but the is the commission first and especially to a unbiased approach the this new instrument also favour the commission for a prudent gradual development the the trade in shelves in the european union
same prudent approach is the basis the the refusal the the commission to the from the the all greenhouse and industries if transport and the administrative sector under the system to let the
a good uncontrollable system can be extended but the must the first up
i believe not that the trade in shelves nuclear favours just blind if the other measures the the european  that do
nuclear will not in eligible to for the system
we to no to a regard the the system in so the community already some learn can draw
the member to the already in preparing and we must always the shared interests the the union for view the
the is also my intention and i i this in october already discussions held to the central and eastern countries to involve the the any future trade in shelves
to finally that the from the large number reactions the the green a  in total how this new instrument in the interest the
the opinions on how the now further must to are divided and the commission will this within a few months january give after the reactions further are examined and the outcome the the  know is
the commission has always tried the european system two to let with the that the the  as this the force the
as you know is the european system in principle in the start while the international trade according the protocol longer the the will let wait
i can to decision say that there general support is for your resolutions and i like again my thank and appreciation express for the attempts the the parliament to the climate more for the lot to to i thank you also for your support the the commission for the implementation
mrs the commissioner the you i to that i to the the the wonderful report the the mr da  and the by you described important and  scenario just on i the a dramatic event the floods the the in the last week in large parts the europe have occurred with particularly in northern but also in france and spain
we are contradiction used the a the language that characterise seems to be for our time  if outside are words act and  are part become the our ordinary house they and 
according us are this disasters the result the the climate and this must with the social and economic system resistance against be is
also the  confirm that the again in our areas change
the exceptional lead the the last week has taken for  the the climate that after the drought the last year strong was balance
they say also that  the in the next years strengthened will arise and will be  by  the floods will cause and rivers outside their words will do act
now our deaths unfortunately are buried the journalists the destroyed areas leave have and the river the po i live the the po again are normal during follows is the high time to as we in italy commit to say are umbrella agree to open not to the ambition role the  to play but to still agree deeply after to think on the needs and 
the there not doubt that in the last years large progress is made with the  thanks the  has the the extent the the disaster within certain limit know to the
how important this measures however also should are they can never if the most  be as the most is that there a policy is which the the against such disasters can against
we must the couple the what the experts us say there must political decisions be taken for territorial issues so the on can be protected also when the such seems
i like still few considerations to the to
the first the the logic the the the bodywork the the human the basis is this must not from the view be lost
the must ensure ensure that the rules for the bodywork strictly in eight be taken and this strict control the the exercised
also must the the role the the agriculture the such affairs not forget
during the last disaster the the po could thanks the imminent large quantities water be take and the the residential areas and the cities be protected
therefore must the again the role the the farmer if  ratify the forget the but already to easy if the such seems
the agricultural the environmental the such and the planning planning be little in the light the this function given
therefore must we in europe the right  this see to find
mr the president the are three important documents the we today must discuss and they concern a the the the challenges which we are faced that like say the climate
for a  the in a area live where the temperature in this warmer rarely over the seven degrees arrive and where the rain with themselves from the heaven is seems the idea the a what climate the the first face respects
as simple is the however not
the the hands having climate is for no a good development
the scenario is other exactly as the just described is storms rain and floods and changes in flora and fauna
the life change and the the there scarcely  the
the three documents on the climate the the commission environment health and consumer has dealt can be as if documents the different periods represent
the resolution on the conference the den hague is the most recent
the present we if environment our vision and hope also the the union the what there in den hague must done
they the characterised by a large agreement what a good basis is for the conference the den hague
the resolution the the a clear way the that the  must be signed and the industrial countries the role must take the the put the the climate
they stressed also very clear that the flexible mechanisms only a supplement the the national measures are
i am welcome to hear that commissioner wallström this view shares
the president the the commission environment health and consumer has to my opinion clear to know given that for us three representatives the the european parliament the the conference the den hague not sufficient are
i am also welcome commissioner wallström to hear say that the commission eight members has proposed
the european parliament and those the the in the parliament with environmental deal must agree seriously taken be and not only if the as chance arrive be used if a type equidistant
the is also important to emphasise that regular meetings and regular information during the conference the den hague constructive would are
the positions the the members must however in eight be taken so the communication not unilaterally the
the resolution on the trade in shelves is a good document but with the changes the the environment is this improve
the most supplement is that as also in the  the a clear border the the the the actual trade in shelves this must not more than sums the the measures for the reduction the the emissions
further is important that there for any country and any sector measurable objectives be called and there legal binding measures be taken the the member force to the the their quotas to the
there there also a certain concerns on the fact that certain sectors as the transport not are included in the green
we to that from that this in the next document the the item will to that like say in the strategy and the measures the the eu to the emissions to reduce and that the transport not stage the the the discussions on the climate
the message is clear in principle must there for all emissions irrespective the source regulatory measures to
many have doubts on the proposal for the trade in shelves with particularly what the socioeconomic consequences of the
the is simply afraid that the employment in risk is the is afraid that companies the different industries against other to play
this doubt and concerns have we in paragraph the the resolution dealt and i hope that this in any case a few people 
there the in this paragraph a clear mistake in the swedish version
only the half amendment that in the swedish document is published is adopted
the third document is perhaps the long term the important
the be the strategy and the measures dealt which the eu the emissions the greenhouse like reduce
also the the reference made the what where the fact to is namely the change the our way if we really something want achieve
the is a welcome document but the would still more welcome are if the more and more was been we hope however that the with the by the commission environment health and consumer approved amendments indeed more the
mr the president mrs the commissioner i am welcome that the debate on the climate in europe and in the world us the opportunity offers to just on to are the the were  the in a large part the europe has hit
this  the german  the name  have given has enormous damage caused in the northwest the italy with particularly in my region fall 
in three four days is there on a total area the km average to millimetres rain cases what numbers corresponds with the rainfall the a very year
this storms has terror sown in the fall  and in the other countries and areas the seems the if there war has been and now must the the head offer the a long and expensive list the claims
they must however with particularly behind see to to which the climate the changed and according what cycles they must than also the necessary european appropriations the available to to to can for in the needs the the populations and that is my position if  measures to can take for the mountain in europe
this measures are absolutely necessary if we this type floods in the future want avoid
president commissioner colleagues us climate change now already
the last thousand year is the  level  become
but the last fifty year is the half level what become
the warming is still more
one or two degrees more is the prohibiting think many citizens but the warm stream the us a pleasant climate the can each at reverse
than to we in europe the climate the canada in the winter many weeks with to degrees frosty
there are radical measures need to the warming the the earth to put
the  is to limited
only already the growth the the aircraft in the next fifteen year  all reductions the the  the
china confuse now already more greenhouse from than sustainable is
this should we our view not for the
after would the developing also greenhouse must to combat but the the basis the equal
any citizen has same right to co from to any
not the american citizens hundred time so if people from 
the basis the  would the international trade in  after the start must to
only the the basis will developing if china and india that to do
in den hague choose for the american line the  will this way block efficiency and renewable promotion are the way forward both in the north if in the south
not  high  as the australian government proposed and also not other not to verify 
also not nuclear subsidising with portrayed  
that would perverse are the a at that america and europe only but  the
fortunately are our ministers and the commission the the good on
behalf my group wish i their million to
a rapid ratification the the  is the right way
we should us not on make the the american senate
after ratification the co a price
now is the still free for the large industries and the producers in europe the joint for the the co responsible are
the green on  shelves within europe is a excellent initiative
europe must everything the everything to to the objective to to
i like a call do the the european commission to additional proposals to develop to the emissions in the transport to restrain
only if ourselves the objective to are we credible
and only than are impulse the the  possible
mr the president as know is the  perhaps the the problem the this time
the is not as that we not know what changes need are the problem is rather that the necessary changes a enormous impact have the very us transport and energy in fact the our whole way the consume
there are radical social changes need to the emissions the greenhouse back to insist
the highest developed countries the countries with the highest economic standard the per person the most greenhouse emit have a responsibility they must a role role the the reduce the the emissions
therefore seems the the crucial important that the the conference the den a agreement the achieved with the united states that lead to both real progress if ratification the the 
a responsible policy the the on the the highest developed countries must based are the the reduce the their own emissions
if there already place must be see for trade in shelves and this i i my doubts on must this only a small part the the total policy of if a such trade there is must this strict controlled be with the view the the social aspect and the future development in developing
this system can in the future large risks that if russia and the developing to participate the the trade in shelves and if this the global read the lines
other there there other types flexible mechanisms the the global level benefits can that
trade in shelves and  can the real changes the need are not replace
same applies course for nuclear
in place of have we a strong policy need less energy renewable energy alternative fuel and effective environmental the transport
the is with particularly the responsibility the the individual member to this measures by to to
the the area the the tax is a common  desirable
if the not possible is to the agree to be on a tax the greenhouse within the eu must the countries the prepared are to the role to take joint however a such tax introduce
we are the agree with the content the the most paragraphs the the  da  but we are sceptical the the trade in shelves
a such system can a interesting experiment the eu are but the can other measures not replace
mr the president in the last years have we the us territory the number natural the exponential way see increase natural the sometimes whole region programmes and villages have spills but the not only to due are the climate climate be fact also by the human caused but also the the intervene the the human in the nature the the way which today solving and citizens deal with the soil a soil the they not improve protect and guarantee
this year had we in italy first the disaster in  and now has the this terrible disaster place in northern with are deaths and more than homeless
with particularly the fall d   and many areas the the po and  are affected
last year has the disaster in france was forests destroyed and very the humanity damage caused
mr the president also five year ago is italy by a large disaster affected
also when are there homes bridges roads factories shops and whole villages destroyed
i was when european member the alleanza alleanza and i when the commission asked immediately the the work to to the areas with  the to encourage and a water card to make the the region programmes the the european union
since are five year has there has a new disaster place and still still is there not water card
europe has nothing done europe has even not pressure exercised the the member and the the measures the planning planning the improvement the the situation
we questions now again to the card in the hope that we than on five year here not again us about must do on our deaths and ourselves must blame that we not that have done what we had must do namely a water card up for the areas the the european union and a directive make with safety for the telluric the  with operational standards for the  with a ban the  and discharges in areas and with sanctions for those the such things allow or ensure
the must last to us our that risk the best environmental is
development also rural must compatible are with the environment and with the human
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the last ten year have we repeatedly can the that the climate in europe disasters caused disasters the still not sufficient are examined and going the po a the the in geopolitical and cultural respect most advanced areas in europe has a dramatic disaster to processing been the a large number deaths and enormous material damage behind the additional
the italian government has in compared with the extent the this moreover the advance announced disaster in a the the strategic most areas the italy and europe really a ridiculous low amount the available the
the italian government behave the towards the  inhabitants the this area the a income and irresponsible way the italian government is too as already earlier is has during the earthquakes in  and the floods in italy
to now to is there not only  implemented the prevent the new disasters
therefore must europe the offer to and steps take the the italian government to ensure to ensure that the damage the the companies in are whole the recognised and this companies be from the each type tax also must they the damage the the citizens recognise the times by active and exemplary volunteers from the po immediately the up have  and the the work are has to the damage to restore
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen colleagues in the first place like i the rapporteur jorge  da  you thank for are excellent work and are report
assumption is not europe subject for  but a the the the challenges the our time
the terrible storms and floods the europe and the rest the the world the last months have occurring would us up must shake
almost all scientists say that this storms and floods drastically in number will increase if we the emissions the greenhouse not clear reduce
therefore is assumption also in economic respect sense
precisely however because we for this challenge are fact the i that the in the discussions on assumption although very often says what the not like but almost never what the fact the like
there is lack the alternatives the constructive debates
many people are favour against nuclear
others are fully opposed against measures
i think however that any possibility to greenhouse back to insist must be opportunity
the they i also that in the discussion on national  the in the member the held the national instruments although rightly be criticised but this to little constructive proposals the be the
i i therefore behalf the group a amendment tabled to a european  in to to the all greenhouse includes and tax neutral is
we have the opportunity the mistakes the the national level be made to correct europe must a positive signal give
the group is also the opinion that nuclear least in the next decades essential is to the emissions the greenhouse to reduce
some member are the plan at the nuclear the to steps or are this already that are that is exactly the wrong signal because nuclear considerably less greenhouse produce than fossil fuels
before countries nuclear goodbye say must they first clear make how they the amount greenhouse think to reduce
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen colleagues i like in the first place the rapporteur thank because he there i i excellent in is managed the different interests within our institution with other to unite and behalf the parliament a position to determine
mrs the commissioner i watching the discussion on the climate in this parliament since
what i since i seen is there fact the the that the parliament still from tactical considerations certain concessions has done because we want that also the country that the most co produces the the the agreements the kyoto the
therefore have we also the  accepted
we are this in principle for and have also still many more concessions done
the a given at is the hurdles than as low to are that the what i the not lower can
we can not still more concessions do
i think than also that we us the the future negotiations if the usa there not in would to ratification on to to really must up the the make the agreements with other countries so ratification also without the usa possible the and there last progress in the matter is
we can not ever concessions continue do without the security to have that the congress than also really agreement is
mrs the commissioner i i course to your speech on the   listened
the was a score but quite  speech on what there all can be done and how good that would are
i i such score speeches the last years already more heard
i would many would together with you last agree for specific measures fighting as the introduction the renewable energy
there is now a proposal the table to that to do which i i about what the commission fact for policy the if a such proposal the promotion the renewable energy by the directorategeneral competition by means the the framework environmental the thwarted or even 
i would together with you for a standard for  homes want fight
i would together with you want fighting for a  the promotion the  cars
therefore not score speeches more but specific the the work to so what now still to good sounds to where to are will the perfectly matter the the world is
mr the president the does i pleased that the commissioner favour for representatives the the parliament the the  but i like the stress that we ourselves a active role into the the the the european strategies
we want not new be as that briefly ago the members befall the present were the the conference the the world
we see ourselves if a  the together with the other european institutions working the a improvement the the situation and the ratification the the 
look you example agree to the phase which we the recent activities with members the the american congress defined if a disappointing experience
the president the the notices  committee said with so words that the here according the americans a economic and not blackmail the
the clearly the world the difference the there there between the american and the european approach
the americans recognised or that there sacrifices the were to be or that we the both sides the the atlantic atlantic a historic responsibility to if the producers the greenhouse
despite already our good intentions seems the there however the that the european union the the end the this decade in place the less more co emissions will produce
the perspectives for  are than also not picture and same can we fact also already say the the ratification the kyoto
this situation the the not they by the governments in the european union the like the ask for lower fuel
if we really utilising are must we the ask the the hand point
we must not cut the taxes
i say yes against the trade in shelves let we the the the work to
let we in the member also almost make with the measures the reduction the the  the improvement the the efficiency and the promotion the the renewable energy and 
the sad truth is that we the climate any not more can prevent but if we now not action take the the problem only still but greater
mr the president mrs the commissioner best colleagues some want nuclear back the the agenda places
i think that the european ministers the environment to now to a i position have welcome by nuclear from to the the the list the flexible mechanisms
nuclear is more than other options as example efficiency and any dollar the the investment in nuclear energy is lost for other investment the many profitable are
nuclear up not really the the needs the the people the want life in  or  housing already to according the  which they the are
nuclear offers not few solution what joint electricity the basis the biomass or gas the does
nuclear remains dangerous
the accident in  has that let see
fifty year after the the the the civil nuclear sector are there still always not solutions found for the waste
there are already billions invested in research but the is still not step further has
the the other on think i that we really the important must recognise the efficiency
we can the chinese consider   many better help by they resources to give to  to buy the little energy use because there will the next ten year million  result
that is what the the fight against co in the developing the crucial will give many more than the two three four or five reactors the we they possibly would sell
mr the president the rapporteur notes rightly the that climate a the the serious environmental is which we to make have
although there since the conference the kyoto and the commitment the emissions the greenhouse with to reduce already three year has are remember the european agency us remind that if there not very specific political measures be taken this reduction not really will be success contrary the emissions the greenhouse will than with increase
the must be however that the emissions by the movement perhaps still the more rising against the year can the with are has
i am the also with rapporteur agree that specific measures and a specific policy the prefer deserve over the trade in shelves the this a supplement must are
the confidence that the mr liese in nuclear has and are enthusiasm ensure part i in the whole not
i am the with the previous speaker agree that certain problems in the with nuclear still not are resolved the judgement the the commissioner that in the proposals the currently be dealt not greater weight the nuclear the granted the i therefore reassure
we think in any case that the european union priority must give the a specific policy and the specific measures the the up the a european programme against climate that specific objectives and objectives contains the concerned us that this not the philosophy is the soon the the sitting in den hague will be defended
mr the president i like there finally just if other colleagues the point that the floods in spain and italy as other socalled natural according us demonstrate that the climate change
mr the president mrs the commissioner ladies and gentlemen in the first place like also i the rapporteur with this two magnificent reports congratulate
in the with the first report need i the floods in the east the spain and the victims of the the the climate are to to write only but to mention the previous speakers are this because already the entered
what the second report the think i that the trade in shelves must be given if a instrument to the from the protocol the kyoto arising obligations after to to
we can the different ways with this flexible mechanism deal  active or reacts
i think that we us both from economic if from environmental active must up
a the the reasons this is the realistic idea that this the short term certain environmental can be success because there specific target for the reduction can be the and a time which the reduction must are achieved
this is also a good opportunity to the research and the development the new technology the control the the pollution to promote i see that therefore otherwise than those the think that this mechanism a way is to the interests the the large polluters permanent safe to to
if this instrument good the used will pollute still more be and will the market ensure ensure that the products the the the least clean way are made sidelined to to are
if emissions commodity be can they also better be controlled and will they be registered
the development the environmentallyfriendly activities will the be encouraged
this mechanism must how than also the transparent way be developed and a the part forms the the measures the the member in the framework the the european strategy against climate must to take
all member must in this the particularly their best do to a and another the the public from to to so the people the from the the good understand what the with this mechanism like achieve and what of the benefits are the must also clear are that this but a  is the supplement the other measures
the the way the there not misunderstandings
president commissioner a large part the the world has soon  need especially in the third world must the being protected be against the emerging water
but also in italy were recently the dramatic effects visible
the precise relationship between co and the warming the the earth is still not fully clear but this must not reason are to now not radical measures to take
the understanding when is here the application
experts tell us that we the current co with must reduce to the climate to put
we work now the a reduction the that is already a whole task
we to in the more sustainable energy and more efficiency rightly
but our intends are not new however must we the that our dependence the fossil fuels since the years hardly is reduced
we must therefore all instruments working and so possible use
that means a support yes against the trade in shelves but the must course the good wellconsidered are
we must still solutions find for important economic and political problems
 can lead to a new form the colonialism
rich countries buy easier reductions in developing and as to they easy the their obligations the
technological renewal the this chipped
the success the  will therefore depend the the price
a to low price makes  the very attractive
the success will also depend the the support
 must honest are and must in the involved sectors a they undertakings undertakings are
the market must used be to sustainable growth both fair distribution to promote
this are clear political choices need
the  in den hague is a opportunity to global steps to to a opportunity the we not lost should let to
we should us not behind behind the unwillingness the the united states
good cooperation between rich and poor countries to  to achieve is need
we must fair principles the
equal shelves for all regret is not only fair but also effective
the is a means to the developing that to to both to technological efforts to promote
den hague must also a agenda for the future that here must equal shelves for all regret certainly a part the are
i thank the finally the rapporteur for are work and i wish the commission many success to
mr the president the climate the the result are the our habits are fully started
our colleagues have again out the the disasters the other continue follow and the document for document  are which we with specific and political measures must respond
we welcome the sharp and upon conclusions the the report the our mr  da  that a overview the the the challenges and expectations but also the the  and given ambitions the the fight to the emissions the greenhouse back to insist
we know that the most stage the in den hague will remain next november
than will we see or the parties the the  their responsibilities the the will take and will respond the the subdue challenges the the us work the us all in same common to and no saving
many predict however a jesse a  agreement the the end would mean the the protocol the kyoto
we refuse in this possibility to believe
the delegation the the european union must decisive are they must the leadership claim as in kyoto the good example give and under not circumstances budge for the temptation the the loopholes
the task is clear and the demands are high
the ratification the the protocol the kyoto is absolutely necessary just as the implementation the home measures the a real contribution make the the fight against greenhouse
the council must not in the the into the in den hague will be odds
the union must refuse nuclear the to take in the list the mechanisms for clean development even if there heavy pressure the exercised in the direction
nuclear is not sustainable and also not clean source
the would just as unacceptable are to  the to take in the flexible mechanisms
the is also particularly inappropriate and dishonest to the citizens to do believe that the enough to trees to plants to the to  the the 
with electricity from nuclear and a considerably area favour france example not the commitments the the is made in kyoto already are the however low
this like say that the the other areas must act
the european union has not the right the to cannot the its obligations
mr the president the before two reports the mr  the  are the important for the preparation the the community the the meeting next month the the parties the kyoto
in the reports the to an the european union a leading role to let role in the international fight against climate
i am the opinion that the work the the mr  the  this objective towards brings
the european agency expect that the amount greenhouse in the european union in the period with will grow
the the in are assessment also that the emissions the most will increase in the movement
especially the  the a utmost in the the reduce the the co in the transport
our commission calls the commission therefore the in its new green with proposals to to for the change the the  within the builtup come so the greenhouse permanent reduced be
the commission take also that additional support the the public transport necessary is the commission  the commission that in the european strategy the reduction the the greenhouse the policy and the measures the the second place to
that can we not accept if the european union really the plan is the leading role to role the the stop the the climate
a own commitment the the european union is especially need because there still not security is on the results the the sixth conference the the addition
mr the president i will the now very simple say
the seems i that we politicians still still not the seriousness the the climate have understand
if politicians are we used on almost everything compromises to the and have we learnt that the world from compromises there
now have we however with a partner to make which we not can negotiate
the nature is a hard reality the the not to  reduces but there simply is
that is as simple that i i almost ashamed to say that i think that precisely here us think us in the abandoned late
mr the president i am the course agree with many the what here today as length the there is has but i like your attention draw the a very specific matter in the with the floods the the last week in northern spain and france
i am a the the signatories the the resolution the tomorrow in vote will be the the the the commission asked  from its own budget available to to the supplement the the support the the national authorities the the by the disaster affected areas
also questions we the commission the on the article member the the treaty the the community immediately suitable financial aid to provide the the affected sectors and more in the general account to the with the fact that a large part the the affected areas meets the the conditions for support from the community structural
the structural can a important contribution make the reconstruction and especially also prevention
the this specific issue must the union the not to to special measures the must as the can to say the encouraged not more closing if the calf already act is
i like with particularly point the the paragraphs and the the resolution europe must the the member insist the sanctioning the their legislation on environment illegal construction reforestation development the the mountain and more in the general on the development the a agriculture which not only  can be implemented but also the soil better can be protected and able
the is clear that a such extensive action not efficient will are if they only the national level the carried the first is here enormous many money that involved and the second more such natural as the climate and the by the co emissions caused damage to leaves on the border
with the adoption the the by us proposed resolution questions we not only to emergency to a contribution the the reaction but also to a more longterm policy which we the europe a safer and  place can make for are citizens
mr the president the commission and also others have already predicted that the most member the with the  established highly the the  not will to the is therefore the crucial important that there now effective measures be implemented
the not to the the objectives is simply not option
according a estimate are there the last two year mainly in the developing people died the result the the climate
the take must radical to be thrown
we can and must efficient and innovative solutions approve to the emissions the greenhouse to restrain and same our society and the employment to protect
my constituency wales is enormous on the the processing and the heavy industry
because the uk per april next a  is impose i i let into what the consequences of would are for the industry in my constituency
from the research was not only that britain thanks this tax the reduction the the emissions according plan can changes but that there even new jobs by will the
several economists have the consequences the a european tax analysed and are to punishes conclusions has for the employment
the discussion is not on continue are and we must the restrain the the emissions not more if a threat but if a challenge and a opportunity take
i hope that will be entered the the in the reports down ask the the parliament and the governments the the conference the den hague a success know to make so the  the short term can be ratified
mr the president to to start like i mr  da  congratulate with are reports and immediately explain that i personally important i the this issue
i possession what forest in the united kingdom that within the current economic impede financial hardly profitable is
however wetlands my trees and the the many others the co the from is the few companies the to the richest the the country properly
owners to not  for this important social function i i must the proceeds the licences and the the trade the the good to the those the this trees plants and manage
they should not being be by the authorities and others the clearly for the that if forestry not pays there not trees be fellowship the co can into
also true the not that a relatively poor sector must pay for the rubbish the a relatively rich sector and the as but for nothing without only compensation
the argue the this situation would also additional income generate for the in the closely take farmers and other murder the the this way would can try the current systematic overproduction the to duration food to to the to a economic healthy system
the agriculture is very topics and the is good would that there public in into must be to the whole range the goods to produce that expect can and must be the this industry
if we the potential energy and  the biomass and other crops sell against the aid for this alternative production and that then compare with the  the be allocated for the production the  food the the enormous difference visible
this figures must in balance be the because without a new sustainable surpasses be the problems the the farmers and the rural only but greater
this is a matter the the cap both the the environmental only when this two policies incompatible can there substantial progress be made
mr the president i congratulate the rapporteur the mr  da  with are report as few speakers already have said is the a tragic omission the circumstances that the nature us precisely during this debate with the consequences the the climate lesson
in the north the italy and in the area where myself live the the  the spain is the human again broken the are people to the life has and have farms factories and other affairs damage ago
the our coast the spanish  the this human caused by  because the water the the mediterranean sea what the rising  the the heated lead caused when the in the  against cold  does
that happening in the  although always but persistent storms if this was the used to the to year for while the now almost any year price is and least a time in the three or four year with tragic consequences
is this now the or not the result the the greenhouse or the climate
i think the the also already have the experts this not conclusive scientific proof for
there must therefore something the this situation be done
the protocol the kyoto which the report that we today deal the has contains a number measures although will the not the short term result be made but if people must we now once try the problems the we have caused to overcome
apart the the greenhouse be the consequences the such natural still strengthened by other causes the also the human greed to due are as the there example on the  the handling or  across built
i am therefore with others a resolution signed which not only the proposed the measures from the protocol the kyoto quickly to to apply to climate against to to but also other preventive measures to take as must the continue with the instance and the improvement the the infrastructure to example the consequences the extremely heavy lead the to catch
mr the president in the joint resolution on the floods the the the a european protection and 
the can however not evil remind to remind that the environmentalist almost always only are if fought must be for a  the  for the up the watercourses for a  the  or a ban the uncontrolled  and for  and measures only the the way can because the electricity the the rainwater be chipped and  be prevent
i would not like want but i fear the worst that on few days when the disaster not news more is and the affected people only are with their problems suddenly no more like that are on in  the changed
i would not like want but i fear the worst that this or particular mayor the will oppose against the construction the a dam or this the the other on like let build against the logic the planning planning and safety in
mrs the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes course can europe help but only the ground can the with possibly also  decisions let see that the the seriously like make for the prevent the such disastrous events
mr the president everyone is the agree on the seriousness the the  and everyone take that the eu a sensible policy must to to the the in kyoto commitments obligations to meet
i think that we still a step further must to
only a good policy in europe is not adequate
the eu must the role take the the international 
otherwise is the  there never
for a such leading role is a active energy need but fact lacks the eu currently a present energy
i am itself member the the commission industry external trade research and energy the responsible is for  and i i the last months time the time can see how  the energy the the union is
the proposals the presented be are not part the a coherent strategy
they be rather without mutual cohesion presented
the one month are we to welcome on the fact that deregulation the the electricity to lower prices lead and a few months later regret we the precisely that by the lower prices the incentive for efficiency and renewable energy decrease
this are only a few examples
a active strategy must ensure for a change the us energy
same must they also a active support the the developing mean
the the part the the investment in energy will namely in the developing place
i see that the commission its best does
in my view is the responsibility for the therefore results with particularly the the member and the our governments the refuse to agreement to to with a common on and the need the a common energy not our
i wish commissioner wallström many success the its work but i like conclude with a question believe they really that the possible is to a active  to to without a common energy
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen colleagues although in the  the the union the priority must are the a sustainable environmental must we in our decisions also account the with the international competitiveness the the industry and the reasons function the the internal market
the responsibility for the protocol the kyoto and the labour in the union to the obligations after to to is the the member
the opportunities the the member to  measures to take are very different
if the quotas per country in the european union on different sectors be divided as under other the mr blokland in are opinion the the economic and monetary commission has said to similar companies in the different member in a fully unequal position rightly
the can example best are that a certain sector in a certain member what the efficiency the to the best the world should and that can example be said the many industries in my own country finland but the however must the the more  than less effective competitors in a another country
that lead you to competition and therefore must the the community level the different industrial sectors not quotas impose
the is the essential important measures to promote the in the practice to achieve are and the the competitiveness the companies not in risk to
my country finland is addition france currently the only eu where the intend more nuclear to build
i am this a hot ruin the because that the for additional competitive for our  industry both what the the economy if the emissions
also in this report must therefore not statement be taken the favour the or against a certain form the electricity all different  must available are the the create the a national 
i like also the important the voluntary agreements emphasise
in several countries be the if very effective as to the  to promote
especially in the enlargement can voluntary agreements a good mechanism forms
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes if i a explanatory must give the the by italian members tabled resolution must i say that we for the second time in five year in the northern region the us country italy a matter tragedy enjoy the result the a natural
this disaster has us one more aware do be the the problem and demonstrated how dramatically such events can are but hand have we the also a task the our shoulders the been although we not the only are the this task must to this is namely not task for a only area or several affected areas
here is solidarity need and this solidarity must the the different levels express this solidarity is initially also already to expression has the moral political economic and part level
we expect the the commission not only that they the damage recognises in the affected region programmes the us country and together with the national authorities the for restoration of but also that they something within the part level so the the the european level aware the the this problem perhaps can than change be the in this problem the floods and disasters in the victory the the extremely nature the the human and the organised society
mr the president the overall warming the the earth is although still not beyond proven but concerned the whole world irrespective national borders the makes absolutely part from the the concept  other 
i am a favour the the free market and the enormous prosperity and freedom the this has has for millions and millions people
hence that i the  the mechanisms this where possible welcome to as environmentallyfriendly objectives if the reduce the the co more reached to make this proposals find we back in the green the the commission and in the report the mr  da 
i i two amendments tabled the first amendment asking to additional research to the other greenhouse as methane   programmes etc
perhaps that the system for shelves must be extended with this substances the reduction the this gases is namely many profitable and less harmful for the economy
my second amendment the consistent the national quotas programmes for the produce the forests as my mr lord inglewood just already said act forests if 
they spare the landscape and can with through the loudspeakers controlled be
i think also that new ideas if the good the mass in oceans to co permanent to made further research need
than like i still like the two controversial points the the report
the first is this there the a  for the whole union i reject this proposal because the favour does the certain tax privileges and because the harmful is for our economies since the to my opinion will lead to a shift the activities to areas where the european jurisdiction not applies
the second point is the choice between a granted exemption the the  programmes the socalled  or a sale the rebels the the quotas programmes
i personally give the prefer the a  system as also the americans that stand the does unjustifiably the the existing  industries and from a double pay for the companies the in the past  are to work and the already lower  have
to finally am i just if my mr mrs kauppi a favour the nuclear that is for i the only externalisation for the one
sv mr the president gentlemen members i like you course thank for your constructive contribute the the debate on the climate and on the way which we the must combat
on a few minutes will i the floods in italy and spain discuss
i will a statement the the commission read i come there as moment the back
first like i however the discussion finish on our expectations the the conference the den hague the on a few weeks will place i must you say that we without more a international role must role
we will the initiative must take we must others encourage and same bridges we between with particularly the developing and countries as the united states
we must the  course force to this conference on the climate to a success to make and let see that we also in the practice credible are
in answer the the question must i say that we according i here the the long term not in will succeed if we not the available have on a series instruments and a series political measures
the objective i course the the transport and our outermost the suitable made must be for the future and the the energy
i am welcome that the recognises that the commission the this area the initiative has taken
i think that there more economic regulatory measures need are
we must course also new areas and the environment and  in all policies discuss
the is again to credibility
trade in shelves is only a supplement the the measures the the intergovernmental and eu from under the our fundamental  and infrastructures taken must be to the climate the head to can offer
i am the agree agree that as today already earlier is said we the competitiveness and the socioeconomic effects in the monitoring must the
this problem must however not used be if a pretext to nothing to do contrary we can the even in us benefit let work and the the competitiveness increase
i like the rapporteur and all other participants the the debate again thank
course will we as quickly possible after the conference the den hague back with a plan to this measures by to to than are the rules hope the
i hope that we after end the the conference can say that the a large success is been
the natural the the european union and its citizens have occurring have a heavy price called
they have led to enormous material damage and in some cases as recently in italy and spain have they also lives cost
the commission is the embarrassing aware the the by this disasters caused suffering
hence that the commission the the level the the common action for protection in the period in close cooperation with the member initiatives took the prevent the disasters and the training the the public
the september has the commission than also a the a contravenes based proposal adopted which a common mechanism the up the coordination the measures for the protection the citizens the time the emergency
there are three reiterate the first the indication and the improvement the the  the in case the need the link between the most  must speaking the second the special training the must lead to a better cooperation and harmonisation between the involved fine and the third the up the a efficient  that the contacts better and more must do has
also lead the proposal to more and more effective victims
the the area the research are there currently several projects the the have the floods and the reduce the risk programmes in the with climatic circumstances
although the conclusion the structural not intended are for natural can they the was be for reconstruction if the member in issue the resources this commitment and for far the  within the existing classification the the structural is
the natural can only a appeal be done the the structural when the a number conditions the met the involved area must meet the the territorial objectives namely objective or objective
 must the have the expenditure the normal about in eligible to for the structural
reconstruction the the this conditions meet should not the financial  the the involved programme of
the project must temporary are one or maximum two year and must not the whole  cover
the structural must also not the place adopt the a insurance
to this type projects with resources from the structural to can finance must demonstrated be that the programme internal manoeuvre offers
the clearly for the that the involved member the for the say has and therefore must determine what measure possibly by the structural financed the when the all conditions for intervention are met
there the also work the cooperation the the level the the planning planning to as the consequences the floods in to flood in the interreg iii guidelines the specific referred to the possibility common strategies to formulate for management in areas
also can there integrated strategies and actions be planned and carried the prevent the floods in transnational  the commission expect also that under interreg iii preventive actions against floods component be in a transnational strategy for already the areas where floods the commit for to do
the commission will the its turn quickly and constructive continue respond the this type ask
than like i to finally still something say on the aid the victims
the european parliament request the commission regular to something to do for the victims the this disasters
the commission can than only respond with the observation that there not line more there for such measures
september on has the mr nielson the the treatment in this parliament the a resolution on fires know made that the commission intend a legal for to to for as such line
the commission has in this however still not final position welcome
the experience from the past show in each case the that us two roads open are
we can the first a line up the the a  way the  in that case would the to not more than symbolic sums can to
the second option would content that the commission indeed a legal proposed but that would mean that considerable sums from chapter the the financial perspectives must be down
the commission must also look how human the management the new activities the this area requires
thank you for your contribution the this debate
to decision the this debate i i a resolution on climate accordance article member the the rules and six motions on the floods accordance article member the the rules received
mr the president the there no a rule in the rules that members compulsory present to are when the commissioner the by them set questions up
i think this behaviour extremely reprehensible the relation the the commission
is this not subject for the conference the presidents
no mr davies this is not in a rules to regulate
this is a issue the  the the parliamentarians
i am in any case satisfied that you here still you but there had more members should are this am i the certainly with you agree
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed

the the item is the report a the the mr lund behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament on a community strategy for  a group substances which the suspect that they the suspected the people and in the wild live animals disrupt
mrs the president today the day know we free many on 
there were very what suspicions but now are many  through on the influence the  the people and animals clear become
we know that they the stunts can reduce
we know that they can lead to  the initiative both the animals if the people and we know that they serious diseases can cause including convictions and 
however there there still large doubt on the general influence the many 
in reality is the situation not to out also not for the next generations
this is to my opinion a  prospect
to still to release the the principle that a action only need was when the risk the a substance proven was and the damage caused was
that is course a unsustainable principle
therefore is the good that the commission in its communication a community strategy for  proposed
i think only that the commission the a to wait attitude favour
they had best what ambitious should are
i think that they to little aggressive and efficient initiatives the short term has proposed
in my report i i tried this something the to do
first and especially must a list to be up the all substances which suspect the that they the suspected can upset this must quickly done
in the report i i for this still before the end the this year to do
the is also important that the on the necessary resources has to all on substances the the list to to in total are the there approximately
also must the dangerous substances the the list identified be so against this substances immediately measures taken can be
the measures can different the nature are a immediately ban a gradually ban on a number years and other restrictions the the use
this list the dangerous substances must against the central the ready can are
the is not need further results the to wait and that must we clear to
the principle must concept and all attention must to the particularly vulnerable groups to
i think the pregnant women baby and certain groups the workers the a large risk are the this substances to be exposed
also is the necessary in the member and the eu a efficient control to the to to
there must the the companies called be that they inform what chemical substances they the the market to in what quantities this be used and what consequences they can have
we know also all that there more resources for research to the extent and the consequences the this substances must be allocated also research on the methods and specific research on the consequences the dilution and synergy are necessary
we know because that this substances in combination a very unfortunate effect can have
 is therefore very important and we must ensure ensure that this research total independent happening our political initiatives should with other words not based are the the research that the producers itself out
the the area the research is international cooperation important under other with the usa and with japan
the would than also good are in the future legislation on chemical substances a individual framework the to to with few specific chapters on 
this legislative framework must based are the the principle and the the opposite proof
also must a timetable for the testing the all cases  be up
i i the on a legislative framework because the rules to my opinion binding must are
with voluntary agreements the this area have we only bad experience
i thank the group and the commission for the cooperation the the up the this report
with the to the amendments like i there only the point that my own amendment a linguistic improvement the paragraph is and that i not can recommend for the three amendments the mrs grossetête to vote
according i are this amendments in high extent motivated by contacts with the chemical industry the i fact also has viewed
their intention is clear they want immediate measures prevent
the commission the council and the parliament to the legislative framework the not the scientific committees
their opinion the the equal footing with the opinion that we the other sources to
mrs the president i thank the rapporteur for are excellent report and hope that we this important problem quickly can tackle
i am the there with the rapporteur on agree that this everything worrying is especially the consequences for the next generations and the effect the unborn children
in the over decades is the increasingly more become that a number industrial chemical substances the in the environment rightly are has approximately same effect have if hormonetreated
we mention the substances 
 is not negative result the something otherwise but a mechanism that cancer can cause and consequences can have for the reproductive the development or the behaviour
some the the consequences can with ordinary test be effectively although the not always clear is or the  by  the caused
the scientific committee toxicity and environment the the eu has said that there for the life in the nature a world problem can questions
also in the opinion the the scientific committee on the consequences for the health the human and animal with special attention for the life in the nature the that the consequences for the health the the human must be investigated because the the between  and distortion the the human health must be up
in the general  the science organic  as pcbs
the commission industry external trade research and energy has therefore a number conclusions formulated in the particularly that the more than alleged hormonederegulating substances fully must be there
we must the substances in the framework the the sixth framework into
we must us the both the women if the men concentrate
we use the technical terms  and  the that that the not only to a  is
mrs the president mrs the commissioner on  there many doubts many questions and not few security
this substances can a very harmful influence have the the death the people animals and plants
we know not long and in what extent someone remind must be exposed
the substances are even not 
questions enough therefore
research must us in the to to answers the already this questions to find
paragraph and to fact in the direction
the is essential that we better with the american and japanese crosssubsidisation to work
a common research to so possible information and scientific proof to data must we certainly support
also must we the the budget the enough appropriations kind so we our ambitions for the sixth framework for research can achieve
only by research can we back what the specific risk programmes the the  are and only the the way can we in the future  with the to chemical substances up
the rapporteur the excellent work has made as the principle the basis for possible measures
but we must intellectual honest continue
the principle must not only to regulations lead also general positive measures must can
with my amendment like i this ensure
i hope fact that there account will be taken with the opinion the the scientific committee toxicity ecotoxicity and environment the september
the expertise the this scientific committee the recognised the is than also appropriate that there the the up the legislation with are opinion the account taken
i think that the for us all important is that we us the the opinion the experts base
the principle the also in that we us the the best scientific knowledge must base
the group the the european party is also against a reversal the the proof i must this the continue repeat therefore pressure i i also time in the sense from
we are no certainly the the is therefore total premature to the responsibility to to times
for any dangerous substance the the the the market like to is a previous approval requires
the procedure the the the already a warning in
the parliament must and the can i the rapporteur the follow the public opinion the consumers the commission and the industry the a fair and responsible way inform
there are justified doubts and there there still uncertainty
this must we appropriate answers
mrs the president i represent the northwest the england with the cities manchester and examples is that a the the densely areas the the european union
 more the brusque in the estuary the the  some often clear characteristics the the two sexes we know not what the cause of is
the the  the the  are the a large number chemical factories the suspicion is the the factories cases but the scientists think also the the  the for industrial purposes and in the households be used
they think the  in the particularly synthetic  the hundreds women in the area in the form the the pill use
the scientists think also the the natural  the women produce
the cause can a combination the this everything are that is the problem
we know the answer not there are more than chemical substances which we can choose
i doubt or the good is the principle to use and fear that the sometimes the abused by the nature itself the that principle know we never or the good is that we the apply
we must us large ensure make on the longterm the the fact that we thousands chemical substances in the environment to but can difficult know the what substances we us must focus
we to the that the quality the the  decrease that  still more does and that women  a  develop that is very worrying and we must than also prepared are certain substances to ban to the simple reason that they suspected are also already have we still not only scientific proof
i support the proposals the the commission and the rapporteur
we should however hard discussions expect if we to determine what chemical substances we must ban
president commissioner colleagues i would  lund want congratulate with a excellent report where my group behind can are
 is a relatively new understanding
in my own larger is the only since one or two year widespread has
i know that the in the danish  substances is and that there this already almost ten year on the talk
in the english is the endocrine  and certainly in the scientific literature is there a large discussion on
but example in the german is there still still not term the widespread is
that the the that the a new problem is but therefore not less serious
we can fully behind the term the are
i am afraid that the european commission under pressure the the chemical industry to long like wait with legal measures
the half the the substances the that suspected be  to are are phosphorus
that has the commission in answer the my questions in the environment admitted
this would we that must start
in each case would they not end the list placed should be
play hormonederegulating its a role the the approval the phosphorus the this at
unfortunately not
in the socalled uniform principles are they not that would the must
i think that that the last the the revision the the  in regulated would must be
i hope that the commissioner this answer the can give
mrs the president i thank the mr lund for are excellent report the deserves the support the all members the this parliament
the consequences the artificial produced chemical substances the in the environment released be are clear
there are enough examples the the damage the this substances seriously the the stunts and the development the animals and plants
a the the most appalling examples are the  the the  the  are the
the that that the harmful consequences the different  a world problem are and even to in the most remote areas the world are apprising
the results the the danish professor  on the clear reducing the the quality the the  the the man would us very concern must make
the is in fact far has that young men the quality the their  would must let testing to to see or they a family can means before they there really the want start to there certainly the to are that they the children can can
as  lund rightly out must the principle to concept
now are there all reasons to this principle many  to to use
under reference to the principle is the possible urgent measures to take to to prevent that there irreversible damage the people animals and plants the
now must we the act the the floor add on the protection the environment and health by the principle to apply for a area where we still many to little the variety
this is the only answer that we can give the the unsafe feeling that the the population there
the report the that the future legislative framework for chemical substances based must are the the principle and the the opposite proof we can this recommendations not quickly enough follow
mrs the president we have if politicians now the task to decisions to take on a very difficult 
this say i despite that my ordinary appeal the the area the the internal medicine is
the effects the  are not always know
the mutual crop is very large
also varies the sensitivity during the lifecycle the the human the at to at
therefore can we not ordinary follow and values the for maximum exposure that is for  not possible
we must if politicians the problem with the  extremely seriously take
i am the opinion that the strategic document on the subject the the commission very good is
we have more knowledge need research must the priority to the risk must up be and there must any furthermore found be
we have assessments the the scientific committee need
the public must objective information to
we must consultation commit with the member the industry and different organisations
to that to achieve is the for the hand that the commission the the hand the a priorities working
what the the proposal for a report the the commission environment health and consumer like i a important  make i am the namely not agree with the view that voluntary agreements in the general not workable method are
i am other the opinion that voluntary agreements a more way can are to you objective to achieve than through the legislation
agreements on temporary  the limited the the market to the feet introduce the harmless products enjoy often the prefer if on the situation not clarity there but when flexibility and rapid measures the is are
to finally like i emphasise that the legislative always preceded must be by a diverse scientific assessment and a recommendation the the scientific committee
this assessments and recommendations will by us decisionmakers in eight taken be
that is a political 
mrs the president who still never something on  has heard and to this debate listening think probably that  more with a    than with the health to make have
in reality is the however to a large problem for the health the human and animal
the this at is the community legislation for chemical substances inadequate to the dangers the  the to tackle
the is worrying that in the human body now more than chemical substances be found the the fifty year ago not present were
many health the women are in the the with exposure the 
as other members here evening already have said is there also a possible the between the substances and the increasing number convictions and other  and the falling 
the possible consequences the that everything for the health and the reproductive the the human and the life in the nature are worrying children pregnant women and vulnerable workers properly to the groups the the the risk are
a another problem is that the almost impossible is values the to to for substances the hormonetreated 
from the view the the consumer is proposed that the proof the versa so the manufacturer with a reasonable security must demonstrate that a product not risk will before the the the market the the
also the also a wider information recommended the basis the the right to 
there is more research need to us in the to to quickly effective and with security the to act
we have absolutely a european strategy need
therefore is this report as important
we have more information a greater awareness the the population and especially more research need
i thank the rapporteur for this report and recommend the the the parliament the
mrs the president in the first place thank i the parliament for are response the the communication the the commission on a community strategy for  and the mr lund rapporteur for are report
the almost any conference on chemical substances the on  about
a the the reasons of is that the substances serious damage can seriously the human and animal and especially the the because and the us reproductive ability
there is hardly something dunes would than a of the us stunts
the problem the the  is very complex and many questions are still not answered
certain things know we the
sometimes can we with free large security predict what there is done on other substances there large uncertainty
what we know is that a number by the human made and in the environment take chemical substances and also few natural substances the suspected the animals and people can upset
to the substances properly a number connections the in live beings be offered under more phosphorus and industrial chemical substances but also other synthetic products
many  are by the connections already the
there are clear check which the  the between exposure the the substances and  the live beings that
the researchers have also a number general conclusions drawn under more that the chemical substances as the mr arvidsson said total other consequences have for embryos foetal and  than for adults and that the consequences the more embodies the the descendants than the the  over
there there however also very what uncertainty because the nature and the extent the the consequences the exposure for people still not clear are
our information is limited in the particularly what the concentration in embryos the
we must the possible dangers the the substances further into to our knowledge to increase and appropriate measures to can take that is the reason why i a community strategy for  i proposed
we have all the right to know and the duty to learn
i like the most elements the the strategy now briefly explain
point is the principle
i i with pleased the that the parliament the commission supports in its intention to the basis the the principle a policy from to devise to the problem the the  quickly and effective to can tackle
the principle and the need the rapid and effective  for  were also by the environment in are conclusions the march stressed
the parliament take than again that the commission in its strategy not far enough is to the exposure the the human the  to to and the life in the nature to protect
i would the a number comments want make
the strategy the the commission there from two important elements
the first is further research and development the second the development the general accepted methods
what research and development the is the most instrument for the commission the fifth framework on research and development
i can you say that the problem the the  the the last revision the the programmes on human health and environment if priority  is the
the commission is also intends a call to publish to the submit the proposals in the with  to the research the that area to encourage
with the recommendations in the resolution the the parliament will account be taken
the development the general accepted methods will two or four year require
we have such methods need because all involved the agreed agree must are that both the tests to the substances the to encourage if the trials itself the uniform way can be interpreted
without a agreement will we always with scientific uncertainty but also with contradictory positions be faced
therefore believe we that legislation to exposure in the general the basis the the principle to to only possible is if general accepted methods available are
general accepted methods are also need to the find to can to to replacement substances
otherwise can the the replacement substances same suspicion rest if the the substances the they replace
also must we however also with the existing scientific data account the
therefore ensure we ensure that we also without general accepted methods the basis the the principle the short term any substance separately can tackle
the parliament supports the intention the the commission to against the end the this year a first list the hormonederegulating substances the to to and to after to to in what specific cases the use by consumers and exposure the ecosystems we measures can take without the further tests to wait
now will also the existing legal provisions on  be analysed
i like on two comments make
in the first place like the commission its objective for end in two steps achieve in the first place will  a list the possible substances up and in the second place will priorities be the
the commission will on a proposal approve
the this at is only the list the possible substances ready
for the second step is consultation with the involved need the to we to a as broad possible consensus on the priority substances
i can now not promise that all possible substances the the priorities will prevent i like not anticipate the the discussions the with the involved the the the are
both the scientific committee if the industry have criticism the the list the possible substances the 
from the first comments the the member and ngos that than again that the the report if a good point as
the criticism the the scientific committee the the scientific shortcomings the the report will the the the the the priorities and the further assessment be take
i like the that the criticism the partly supports the the wrong were that priority will be granted the a group the substances the in this report the the
the substances are in reality included in the list the substances which the discussions in the with the the the the priorities still the the the are
important is also to know that the list dynamic must are
new substances can be added and other substances can be removed if new data know be
my second comment on the list the priority substances the the in the resolution down request to the regard the a number substances for middle measures the to to
to from to make the regard the what substances the the priorities measures must to be the is a more assessment the the use by the consumer and the exposure the ecosystems need
also will the scientific committees in the specific cases a very important role play by independent scientific opinion from to to
expect that the objectives within six months can be achieved is the very ambitious
we will however everything do to as quickly possible progress to make
as you know is the commission intends against the end the this year a paper on the general policy on chemical substances for to to
we work the that paper and i i the first drafts given
a the the principles the that policy is that we a high level the protection want offer
the strategy for  must consistent are with the general policy on chemical substances
a number specific elements in the resolution the the parliament as the reversal the the proof the new definition the the liability the the manufacturers the revision the the believes and the group the chemical substances for the implementation the  and tests be in the framework the the general policy on chemical substances tackled
in the paper that now the prepared will account be taken with the positions the the parliament in this resolution its
what finally the international cooperation and exchange the information the organising the commission in the first half the with the support the under more the world a  on 
the the  will all involved into what progress are made and recommendations formulate for the development the methods and  the research and the drafting the 
i thank the parliament again for are support the commission is determined its strategy the implement to to and the with the in the resolution down comments account to the
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
processed products the basis the vegetables and fruit
the the item is the report a the the mr jové peres behalf the commission agriculture and rural on the proposal for a regulation the the council to amendment the regulation ec no on a common planning the markets in the sector vegetables and fruit and regulation ec no on a common planning the markets in the sector processed products the basis the vegetables and fruit and regulation ec to introduction the a system for growers the certain  com c cns
mrs the president the commission has a proposal tabled that under the pretext the technical adjustments additional budgetary restrictions contains for a sector the however already the victims the discrimination within the common agricultural is
under other by the  between the euro and the dollar is the support the last few year with fallen the relation the the contribution the four year ago was granted
the proposal the the commission the the support the this low level to maintain and the aid directly the the  to pay what abolition the the levy to result has
for the end the this year must the commission a report on the function the the common organisation for vegetables and fruit submit the can possibly also new reform be our
the commission justifies the before proposal with the argument that there almost is is
the commission agriculture form not in doubt that the affairs where the commission the that concerns urgency are but has itself new urgent the also terms are there differences with the proposal
for the commission agriculture is strengthening the the  a the the priorities
the problem is that the  since the reform the the common organisation in the main instrument for the organisation forms
the this at is however only the the vegetables and under in  together
a common organisation with a scope the only the the production deserves a such term not
we must ensure that the supply in  the name if there something is that with urgency must done than is that the the
this this a exception in the common agricultural is and the producers itself the  must authorise is the clear that the up the the community financing the instrument the is is to the objective to achieve
this is the reason that the commission agriculture has proposed the percentage community financing for a number common actions the various  under certain conditions the to to with particularly in the regions where the the most the the vegetables and under is appropriate than the for associations or mergers the 
the quantitative differences between the proposal and the proposal the the commission agriculture that moreover almost the unanimity is approved concern mainly the informed the the support and the 
the by the commission agriculture requested support seems perhaps excessive high but that is only appear
the by the commission proposed support is namely particularly low and the the purely economic  to aegean which the income the the growers the the
economic factors are under other the  between the euro and the dollar and special events the the markets
the line the the commission agriculture limited the actually to the back the the before existing support
in this the i i there also the that the abolition the the levy and the direct payment through the  to problems the can give in the particularly in the countries with the main 
in problematic situations can only a reasonable attracts the income the the growers the level the
to absurd situations with ongoing fines to prevent the the committee for the support the to to the the average level the the last years
the try we the support the to vote the the  and the  the the market and are we not the risk that there surpluses the
perhaps asking someone the the how the amendments financed must be
this i i the next answer currently receive the sector vegetables and fruit million euro less than the ceiling that in the financial perspectives is down
course must we the budgetary neutrality in eight take but we must also to agreement to on the importance the this understanding
according i means budgetary neutrality that we within the borders must continue the the the approval the the financial perspectives are down
the commission like the support however to a historic reached reduce
to my opinion must the discussion with particularly to to on the way which the objectives the the common organisation must be implemented the on of can budgetary agreements be made
the seems there often the that the institutions the the everything can afford as their proposals the to cuts the the budget to
we must us in the first place they to the improve the the efficiency the the instruments the we with are all in the life have established
without budget can there not european construction are in the budget the the sector vegetables and fruit to many social and territorial imbalances in the common policy clear to expression
i join my speech the with a floor the thank the my colleagues the the commission agriculture
thanks their understanding and cooperation i i this the not easy report end however can complete
mrs the president mr the commissioner the parliament will the tomorrow express on the proposal to reform the the sector processed products the basis the vegetables and fruit
the reform is according us necessary but the proposal the the european commission is not exactly what us for view was
there must be met the the objective to by promotion the the  the group the the supply to encourage as my mr already has said is last year only the the production through the  in the trade the
mr the commissioner the commission agriculture and rural has amendments approved which the the that during the first five year the the costs for the creation and force the this groups from the eaggf the cofinanced
this amendments are not superfluous luxury also the in the commission agriculture approved financial support the in place the the the gentlemen the the by any  in the trade take production is certainly necessary
we are not fortunately with the by the european commission proposed thresholds the thresholds must the the development the the markets be adapted
the already approved and by the rapporteur tabled amendments in the direction to than also our support
the list products would must be supplemented with products the if result the weather or economic factors the strong price subject are
the proposal to the for the  the maximum quantities for  to reduce the to must i i than also not to be followed
for the manage the the market in crisis must we still few instruments introduce the if net can must in case the a serious crisis can the for the  the maximum quantities example with approximately be exceeded
the regard the the labelling there a regulation
the current legislation must to be amended so the consumer fully informed the and in the is to determine or the product already than not with fresh recipes is prepared
this to always many questions and complaints the the side the the consumers
i support the amendments the the have the tomatoes     and asparagus this products are the large regional important
with the to nuts and places results in the particularly hazelnuts remains the request the force to the financial support the the  the a programme for the improvement the the quality the implement have the to extended this applies also for the specific measures the for this sector are affected and the the next year end
the expressly request the the commission agriculture and rural must the  for june be tabled the the hand of can the developments in the sector be evaluated
this reform the a increase the the budget in a increase the however within the the the european summit the berlin approved line is
the commission must again to count but the a crossing the the ceiling is not there
the difference in the proposals the the commission and the european parliament is euro
mr the commissioner budgetary neutrality means not that the costs the the proposal not over the to now to spent sums should it budgetary neutrality the in that they lower must are than the the the summit the berlin agreed sums
i concerned the the opportunity use the rapporteur praise to to its i am very satisfied on the work that we with are all have done
probably is this a the the proposals which the parliament the most negotiations has must to
mrs the president this debate is the result the the by the commission proposed reform the three regulations on vegetables and fruit processed products the basis the vegetables and fruit and the system for growers the certain 
as already said is the commission the the work has without the report on the force the regulation ec the to wait according the commission is this report for the end the this year available
the fact that mentioned document not the then as however for the hand is and the reform already in the is the shows the that the commission not very in the results the its report is interested and the nothing the the content that the late are
by this procedure can we us not the the impression cannot that the commission determined is the regulations to any price to reform has the reform so almost
if the question is or the before regulations reform need is the answer what us the without more yes
if the question however is or there need is the the by the commission proposed reform answer we the question certainly tenure improvements in the  the the sector should because never the expense the a sector to the there in the community budgets however already as heavily 
the information in the report is not the shocking the sector vegetables and fruit is a important share the approximately in the agricultural 
the financial effort is however low and the even still further reduced in was still the the appropriations the the eaggf to this sector
in was that only there are still two sides the this matter
one is this sector the enormous important for the employment hand the they for income from sale if result the the agreements with third countries
we to us the not few way against this agreements times because they are a way to our solidarity with  and developing to express the seems however not logical that the price the solidarity only for account is the a sector the there in the community budgets always already heavily is issued
the there not doubt that we the report the the mr jové peres will support
the is a excellent report which we the rapporteur congratulate the balanced way the he the different interests and agreements divided
are proposals as the what the most unreasonable aspects the the proposal correct can a positive the have
our support is deserve
we give this also from the conviction that the council perhaps more for the considered and reasonable proposals the the european parliament is than the commission
mrs the president mr the commissioner the group the free european alliance supports in large lines the report the the rapporteur the mr jové peres
the proposal the the commission the to us believe very certainly budgetary restrictions which the sector financial therefore enormous the being
we must not from the view lose that the sector vegetables and fruit the first common organisation is the by its own growers the financed the is than also the the the important the  to promote and a increase the the  to support
i stress that the sector vegetables and fruit a considerably percentage the the agricultural  the the european union represents
however is only the the appropriations the the eaggf to this sector
also remind we the the broad consensus in the commission agriculture when this report was approved
this production has a the is mediterranean nature various member are involved involved
the is a sector the very many direct and indirect jobs generating what a particularly dynamic economic activity with the of
the is the most income the almost two million european families
we must not forget that the  the by the amendment the the commission agriculture strengthened and encouraged will be the the the important are for the development the the rural in certain areas
the vegetables and under is very closely linked with the mediterranean  what the is the for a balanced and healthy diet
the is than also necessary that a the the priorities the the  the promote the  is
the sector vegetables and fruit is however a insecure future meet under other if result the the  community preferences in  trade this can the to now to done work completely objectives make
the regard the the future must we us than also especially constructive and vigilant the to to
mrs the president the by the commission proposed amendment the the common organisation in the sector vegetables and fruit will lead to still greater problems in the current organisation and the they the the cap still increase
the vegetables and  to the the still many difficult
with particularly the next measures are worrying the measures the abolition the the levy for the for processing intended tomatoes reduction the the maximum support the  the to the the gentlemen the the by any  in the trade take production provisional reduction the the the aid in the first year after reform the the organisation and a reduction the the amount you the from the market can be taken
this sector is from social economic and strategic respect especially for portugal the important the sector generating enormous many employment and supports the rural in the vast region programmes in the southern countries
the amendments the our  jové peres deserve therefore our support tried the because the unacceptable positions the the commission to correct with particularly the proposals against increase the the support the growers for increase the the thresholds and revision the the restrictions the the support for 
mrs the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes after the com in the sector wine and oil is also the com in the sector vegetables and fruit very important for the southern countries
moreover have fact only the spanish mr programmes the floor held
the excellent report the our friend and mr jové peres deals a very important and very symbolic subject and not only because the figures the the here almost two million families or jobs but also because the european commission mr fischler with the disastrous reform the a large number women men and rural areas aware has condemned
a example from france more the from the  for the exploitation the hectares  sums the production the double the the francs
the exploitation is therefore disappear
who are debt is that
not the the the slaughter they have tried to the in organisations to  and to cofinanced  the to up
but this must you the income have and to income to have must you can sell
that can they not because the powerful  the the see outside europe trip the  to from argentina the  from chile zealand and south
the reactors buy their stocks in the countries because that cheaper is because the workers in the areas not few social protection know because the duties are abolished because the european commission is matter by the disease the the wanted diplomacy say but the disease the the global trade
in name the a world foreign policy has brussels our   and  sacrificed the people be if bargaining used in the trade
the deal is clear the southern does the the fruit and the vegetables the ornamental and the wine the north the perhaps the industry
what to do as colleague  already said
doubt is the appropriate to the excellent amendments the jové peres the good work has made and the the commission agriculture without the pretext the the budgetary neutrality the to take because if there with money to kosovo the balkans indonesia and asia the away than must there eurodosh are
but best mr programmes if we not end make the the global abuse the europe will not only the farmers disappear but will very europe in the atlantic the the market drowning
mrs the president mr the commissioner before we the past financial bear and new working introduce must the reached results be analysed
the is not to deny that there since the year which the com the the sector fresh and processed vegetables and fruit in are whole was amended not there is been the only fundamental on the impact the the com in the sector although the still the announced and the regulation already three year the applied that is long enough to the analysis from to to the for any reform need is
the interests the a whole sector which almost two million people from the centre and south the the mediterranean countries working are are the the stake this areas be unanimously given if the weakest the the european union
the sector vegetables and fruit has to camps with production and the global liberalisation the the markets while a research for the innovations in the biotechnology still still there
this sector has the most to suffering the the international agreements the marrakech despite that he the the gentlemen the the agricultural production in the european union represents
if the the intention the the new com is to the  to promote if alternative for and integration in the european economic system the  must for a such policy the necessary financial resources be allocated so the operational programme programmes can be carried a real financial quotas the the least the the sold production in place the the by the commission proposed
to by to can work questions the growers to laws the the development the the sector vegetables and fruit support and not among
mrs the president mr the commissioner the com in the sector fruit and vegetables was in reformed and after three year is the balance unclear
to the producers economic more to make were there collective projects started and was the contracts with the authorities the to to cofinancing to to end proving the results the this reform against to the
they had fact not future because a to small part the the production in  was together as earlier already was the namely less than
under the circumstances were the  also not real over the the regulation and the sales the the products in the sector fruit and vegetables
also is the budget the the eaggf for this sector since although regular increased but during the year is they constantly no because there if result the the bad  to little appropriations were was
therefore are we now in the paradoxical situation that the common agricultural many to little account the with a the the most european agricultural the the the production  very many employment generating in the production and the processing and the the final production for are account the
in this the like i course the important stress the the proposal the the commission which we evening debate
but i like especially the quality the the report the the mr jové peres commending are sensible proposals must the results the this sector in the southern countries still more improve by the aid the the the value the to to and there even the to make to as the  the the supply by the  the to encourage
to finally like i still say that i hope that the council this reform quickly approves so they in with the necessary resources in force can act
president our   a  or a where
the was a difficult subject the this crisis in the vegetable and importance in parts the europe
the analysis endorse i and the analysis must we also use in the next wto so there state negotiated the for the products which not  is
also the must a way find
the second point is the position the the growers
are favour to this more to support and the position the the growers to strengthen endorse i and i eight that essential
because the the current violence the  the supermarkets can the gradually the question arise or there not there is the in any case a to large  and together the  and the question is or this gradually not otherwise are
this is but one answer possible a more action the  and the better organise of
the see i more than more money launder in a sector
the sector must a greater dominant to
and i must also say that i this more in see certainly for vegetables and fruit for vulnerable products the quickly sold must be
a number comments with the to the distribution on the countries also the the quotas with the to processing and the thresholds
i note that the distribution the a number points not whole balanced is
and i expect also the the  tomorrow a oral amendment with the to in any case one the the countries the the processing the 
but also if you look to the distribution on the southern countries look example to the position the portugal the relation the other countries be you you ask or the distribution in all respects balanced is
principle would i want say and in the sense like i also the favour follow the our spokesman mrs  that the essential is that the position the growers strengthened the that the  more be because i can you say that that must done they must feasibility the the market are that will the policy must are
as we a organisation have and one say we want not more money the will that only work when you hand also look to the  and perhaps a certain control of
but i course in this report and also if response the this report precisely for a strengthening the 
mrs the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues the commission has the july a proposal tabled for the amendment the the common organisation for vegetables and fruit although we in december a report the the commission on the function the that this organisation expect
if we now the advance few points change must the commission then the than available assessment without if basis use for a revision the the organisation for vegetables and fruit and the necessary changes make
precisely for the  greeting and fruit is the together the  and the training the  and also also the commercial cooperation between  from different regions the particularly important
the organisation the to a good the
however must also be look to the farmers the for itself and their families with many energy a part the their production itself from their company directly the the consumer sell
the itself the the market to the vegetables and fruit offers many companies the necessary additional income and often are the also precisely the experiencing the this if independent part the the company do
also stressed especially the direct sale from the company the  the the products and the the also a the potential the purchasers achieved
therefore must the amendment the article member paragraph c also as be formulated that the growers with explain the the  a per individual case the to to part the their products directly the the consumer for personally use can sell
if the currently current rigid border maintained the than are the  forced to members the this regulation not fulfil outside to the
this would than to result have that the  terms  be weakened and that they the influence the this growers the regard the their activities in the direct sale lose that like say the the compliance the quality the respect the  and the achieve the common 
therefore request i you to also this account to the
mrs the president mr the commissioner the vegetables and under is in the countries the southern concentrated they represents the the agricultural  the the whole european union
in some provinces in the south the spain represent fresh vegetables and fruit even more than the the production they forms this the only driving for rural and employment
also is the to productions the not community preference more enjoy they must in the abroad compete without that they can back the the compensation the approximately from the  the the traditional continental products to
mr the commissioner the has there all appear the that this sector the  for the preferential agreements with third countries and the running changes the the the against protocols is this is still the that this countries must produce without the financial social and ecological conditions the we in europe have while the harvest the the same time if in our  place
this is a unfair unreasonable situation the is namely unfair that there in the abroad competitive must be without the protection the the continental products the enjoy
the is also unfair that if result the internal obstacles and by the legislation imposed fines the budgetary neutrality not in eight the taken the in agenda the million euro is the
finally am i the believe that this proposal certainly for improvement room is the report the the mr jové the i the i congratulate can the very good if principle must
there must i i how than also a improvement to
mrs the president mr the commissioner the proposal the the commission for the vegetables and  is far the fully and inadequate deficit i like the aspects all
in the first place must the guaranteed maximum for the different types vegetables and fruit be increased to this better the to vote the the real community production and to meet to to the the question
i think with particularly that the guaranteed maximum for processed tomatoes in portugal must be increased this will the z such least close the during the summit the berlin the amount must to other tonnes
the second the by the commission proposed support per tonnes is inadequate
a increase of is necessary as moreover also by the rapporteur the proposed
because the levy now the abolished will the production significant fall we must therefore prevent that growers there in income the backwards to
the third like i say that the level the the  also fully inadequate is
moreover is the as the rapporteur presented impossible to the organisation the the  to improve without the resources the the funds to increase
finally like i still say that the commission a  has let are to the cap fairer to make
as you know mr the commissioner the this sector the the the agricultural production for are account the still not the the budget
the this at life the vegetables and  the the european union mainly the income from the market the what what they itself the the market sell
they have therefore to make with  programmes and  and also with mr programmes from other countries the products if produces fertiliser crops beef milk etc produce and the from the cap a guaranteed income have without that they any risk are
mr the commissioner there must very quickly a end made be the this  in the cap
mrs the president mr programmes i welcome the report as the is tabled and also the opinion the the commission agriculture on the position the the parliament the relation the the old regulations and the proposals the the commission and the council
that the course not way that there difference the opinion can are and also is as tomorrow during the vote will will just as there reasons can are to changes for to to or this changes to support
the seems that that there in the proposal the the commission and the council little account the taken with the way which certain products nutritional be with their characteristics and its and the social environment which they nutritional be a mr the just spoke has that also already said
i think therefore that some subsidies in gentlemen are fallen not only by the current value the the euro itself we moreover better measures can take before the situation expressly in opposition against the european union if whole but also what the the necessary attitude the relation the products from the mediterranean
recently are there rightly protests and actions been but also are there the parliamentary level few proposals tabled proposals on the ceiling the the financial support proposals to the support for all  to harmonisation independent the the legal a proposal that according i supported must be to the aid after the three year not stop to to and finally a proposal to for certain products with particularly nuts the informed the the subsidy particularly carefully to determine
mrs the president gentlemen commissioner gentlemen colleagues i i large understanding for the efforts the the commission and the commissioner to savings by to to and that is also good as
but without that i like that the savings be  the other sectors the situation in the sector vegetables and fruit reductions piling
increasing quantities imports from third countries fluctuations in the consumption both terms amount if quality are this the most arguments
the situation the  also already is they not as criticism if mr martinez says
with hectares be you example in my born  very good life
therefore as very is the still not but however
if you example see that the sector vegetables and fruit with the supported and the arable with than i you almost think that there a comma to many is the
unfortunately is the comma the the the good place the
the is really to
a affected that in the benefit is the a other agricultural namely the crops where the many more freedom the act was than the the sector vegetables and fruit
international  to partly the expense the the sector vegetables and fruit and are the in the benefit the other economic sectors
i am the opinion that this additional financial reductions difficult to  is and i hope that the commissioner the commission and the council as sensible will are to the the two existing points the discrimination not still a third to to add because the here a additional savings like changes i hope that there account will be taken with the wish and proposals the the parliament the rapporteur and the commission agriculture and rural
mrs the president gentlemen members before i before the the content the the report like i both the mr jové perez thank for are report if the members the the commission for the time and effort the they the have made for the amendments
one thing seems i clear just if the any other whole new regulation must also here in the sector vegetables and fruit the basis the experience the we in the last years in the practice have gained a assessment place and also must also the organisation be refined
the member and also the representatives the the sector itself are the with the commission agree that there few priority problems are the we as quickly possible must solve
that was the reason why the commission a type reunification the the report has made and this proposal now the discussion has presented without the the final report to wait
we have us the four areas concentrated the is to the two ceilings for the support the the  and also to the system for tomatoes the for processing for are the is to the informed the the quotas for tomatoes you and  and to export
but the fact that we this four issues already the advance deal means not that we this report that in the organisation the called not be will present
we will that in any case do and we will that also still this year do
as i however from many amendments can made has you now the the opportunity eliminated and except the four issues the the commission the discussion has presented also still a office taken the the final report
the that a certain discrepancy between the view the the commission and what you here proposed
by what principles has the commission the the the make the its proposal than the let lead
with the view the the difficult and the decisions the berlin would because any proposal that to fundamental increments the the budgetary the favour the one certain sector would lead not realistic are
therefore is the proposal based the the principle the the 
i know course that the financial resources for the sector vegetables and fruit the bananas just outside one left since the reform the are dropped and that also the forecasts the agenda not fully are have
this are with particularly two factors responsible the first are the expenditure for the support the the  many less increased than expect and the because the  the the  not as strong are increased if hoped and the second was the the calculation the the support for the processing account taken with the increasing prices the the global market and also with the development the the dollar
the finally the the proposal the the commission a farreaching simplification because the existing  for the most products harmonised and the also transparent be
for tomatoes   and you be addition the community threshold national thresholds the and the wellrehearsed support the the the  paid
a benefit the the proposed amendment is also that the  the basis the the future future for indefinite time the amount the the financial support free can negotiate on the price for the recipes
this are  in the future unnecessary
also will the introduction the one guaranteed ceiling for the support the the  both the model the operational programmes if the settlement that considerably simplify
with this principles for view like i now like like the the by you proposed changes
i am the opinion that this in three groups classified can be the the first group is the to general comments on the common organisation
the amendments and have the the the strengthening the the role the the  the the amendments and is the to a more support for peripheral and regions regions and to measures the the amendments and to the reporting on the common organisation
the amendments and have the the increase the the eu for the sector vegetables and fruit
i i apply already this general comments on the organisation not in the framework the the before proposal they are namely forward the the proposal that we the plan are in to must and must therefore in the context the this report be discussed
the the second group is the to specific demands with the to the function the the common organisation as example amendment on new  and the amendments and on special aid the heavy crises
with through the amendment must the direct sales be improve and the amendments and have again the the the 
the amendments and have the the the  the nuts and the from the market take the products
just if the the first group the also this amendments not within the framework the the before proposal and they can therefore also not be adopted
i must however admit that both groups few interesting aspects contain the the commission in the framework the the latest end this year in to must reports carefully will assess
i i that that the assessment the a increase the the financial resources for nuts already the subject the a proposal the the council is that the october was adopted
the third group amendments has the the the proposal that here the treatment is
in the amendments and the a increase the the community support through the  proposed
the amendments and aim the by the commission proposed reductions the the maximum percentages for from the market taken products to let the
the amendments and up the the the water and with the amendments and the the different way the increase or amendment the the  and support for tomatoes   and you proposed
amendment provides in a simplification the the procedure the adjustments the new products in the 
the amendment is the to a transitional for tomatoes and in amendment the a research to the abolition the the levy asked
the finally for the amendments to in direct support the the growers the fee is the the processing
the most amendments in this group lead partly to considerable increments the the budgetary and are therefore a considerable breach the the principle the neutrality
therefore can i this amendments not accept
course was also monday in the council discussed on the issue the the general volume the the community financing the this sector
this discussions will certainly continue and this point will certainly also still a important element are for a just decision on the proposal
the amendments and would the regulation to my opinion earlier complicated make than simplify and amendment with not within the framework
the commission is the however content agree with amendment we will look or there this a better legal form there
the amendments to change the existing system such that the efforts to  to develop in risk be the
to finally like i like still the the next point any postponement the the proposal the the commission would to lead that the most amendments the according the current proposal from january respectively the beginning the the year the force must are only a year later in force act
the commission is the opinion that this a unnecessary penalising the the sector is
therefore was the proposal the this at tabled and i hope that the parliament this week are opinion will produce and the council the proposal for the end the the year will adopt
the debate is closed
the vote take to at place
 in the irish sea
the the item is the report a the the mr nicholson behalf the commission fisheries on the proposal for a regulation the the council to the the supplementary technical measures for the restoration the the  in the irish sea  vii a
mrs the president when i the the drafting the this report thought i i i wonder or the for a politician from northern the a way decision was a report on perceiving  in the irish sea to want up
i believe however that we in the political also the positive aspects the the life must look
originally was this perhaps a water gift but i hope however that the parliament the commission and myself something to the can to that good and useful is for the fishermen the the the fisheries in the irish sea on are
this report the the protection the young cod in the irish sea
we must however clear say that the not only to the protection the young cod but also the many other types in the irish sea is
that is important
this  will also the other types in the irish sea the good to
in that the is there the last time a thorough change in the aware growing that the protection essential is
five year ago would the fishermen in that area still have said that there not measures need were
now would their response certainly more are and would they recognise that there a problem is
the question is now how we that problem can solve
i am welcome with the cooperation between the fishermen their representatives the commission the local and regional administrations and the national governments
to progress to can make must the cooperation be continue
we must this can build
we must the cooperation strengthen and to a success make
this must however not  be
the commission must against the fishermen not say that they everything know
the commission must to the fishermen listen with their experience and knowledge account the and with them work
in this report be also technical changes asked more the what the meshes the
this is a extremely technical report the fishermen must with the commission and the regional authorities work to ensure to ensure that we not longer destroy what in the past always if a natural wealth was as
in perceiving  in northern are three ports fully the the fisheries on   and 
last year could the fishermen in the area during eleven weeks not  because their provided were suspended
that was a hard time
to the young cod to protect and the  to respect have they however their cooperation granted
i believe that they that also next year will do
the fishermen expect that the commission them the a positive way deals than in the past
we must a way find
that is for no a easy task
i believe that we a solution can find but only if everyone without
i i amendments tabled the the hope can help
i hope that the commissioner this positive the will respond
the technical measures would annual again must be examined
that would for the fishermen in the area a large aid are
the measures are a heavy burden and therefore must we they annual again look
i hope also that the commissioner a  can  and something can do the the socioeconomic consequences the the proposals
will the commissioner if the regional or national authorities a proposal do this positive respond and a means seek to the fishermen to support the technical aspects as need to improve and the the new standards to meet
this is a very difficult situation
a solution is not for the hand
i hope that the commissioner positive will respond
mrs the president mr the commissioner i beginning with a adapted quote the the german closer   think i the fisheries in the night than can i the sleep not more summarise
this can be added think i the the  in the irish sea than i i only really up
vigilance is is or know you perhaps why the since many years more than voting  fact are historic reached could achieve
is that group the the fish the the fisherman the the reproduces or the the society
what have we the a integrated management the coastal which we soon will speak because maritimeoriented with a structural behind have a new identity and especially modern jobs need
but that is only if there last a solution found the for the issues the the cornerstones the  the powers and the responsibilities the all levels
there must sensible verifiable technical measures be applied
we have sanctions need the obligations impose we have member need the their right exercise to the origin to control also under financial pressure
also must there a threefold harmony there between the political like the training clearthinking fisherman and the cooperation between the consumer and the entrepreneur the the market
the three forces must the all working for one idea namely the idea the the sustainable exploitation the a  the valuable and irreplaceable is
the operators the ground are joint responsible with money only be the problems the the long duration not resolved mr nicholson
with technical measures the a from balance  nature however again the item the and is the cod according i also again in the irish sea back
our society is unfortunately inclined laws to paying
also in the irish sea is the not problem programmes night laws to paying
we all myself including will again calm can sleep if there specific controls and reporting place and all involved the high to low a continuing dialogue with other into
therefore has the fisheries the report the our sounds mr james nicholson new supported
we questions same the the parliament the commission and the council
mrs the president mr the rapporteur mr fischler this report is a sad story on a fish which a author has said that he the world in the over thousand year has changed
the beginning the this new millennium is very otherwise than the beginning the the previous
all in the world also in the irish sea is the fisheries strong extended the results are even
the dramatic fall the the  in the irish sea is clear
the to are the  the the irish republic the to tonnes fallen
you not not  to are to in to see that if we in the future in the irish sea still the cod want fish conservation essential are
before i the on the technical measures i like i the on the fish itself have
on has still no something said know you that cod everything eat
cod is a free sniping fish
the eurotaste constituency meat is the result the the fact that cod slow is and not strong  has however is cod a addictive for people the a diet follow
cod contains only fat but not less than protein places cod contains even protein
the cod is there also not waste
cod the for many the through  on are make written
in this report be technical measures described to young cod to protect
the is in the first place to the meshes and to the networks
the rapporteur has the on compensation but that is a dangerous way
compensation can a abdicate for a  are
a sustainable fisheries so the fishermen and their families can existence and however conservation can be taken is everyone the good
the the way have the  the time to the to restore and a sustainable fisheries possible to make
let we ensure ensure that the people in this millennium with same taste cod from the irish sea can eat if in the previous millennium
mrs the president i am the mr nicholson grateful for the he presentation the are report
this the us in the tomorrow on a proposal to vote that very certainly application require
i i however still only doubts the the amendments and the the asked to the from this proposal arising changes the the  through the  to finance
although i in principle not objection against the to the support the the fishermen i think i the that this in a specific framework and the on the clear criteria granted must to be my question is there than also the the what criteria that are
the rapporteur based the for are request to support the article and the regulation ec
i am the believe that most article member the application is perhaps can the commissioner i explain why the ask from the report according him under mentioned article the
if the namely the believe is that the measures from the before proposal under article member the the  financed can be applies this also for any technical measure the a reduction the any consultation the the fishing with the of
we must not forget that any technical measure per definition a certain reduction the the activity means
i think the important this the to to the is because clearly that any technical measure already than not directly a financial loss for the fishermen means
if this the criterion is and measures if the before for subsidy in eligible to than to also all other measures arising from a amendment the the technical measures the a change the regard the the use the  or  aim for subsidy in eligible than must practical all reforms the the regulation on technical measures be financed
mr the commissioner i i need the a explanatory the this point article member can because the very many different ways be explained
can you i tell what interpretation the commission the article member the
thank you the mrs the president the this for us all very long evening the you the i a minute present
mrs the president i congratulate the mr nicholson with are excellent report
he said the that to effective to are the measures the support must enjoy the the fishermen and scientists the in the area life and work
this can the agree the the essential important are for the strategy for a delegated fisheries the we in the framework the the reform the the cfp have discussed
the the increasingly more that the fishermen and scientists in a certain fishing easier rules and rules will failure the they itself have up than rules the their from brussels be imposed
the large organisations in the united kingdom the scottish  and the national alliance the  the the interests the vessels defend support the concept the the  management
the fishermen fear also that rules and rules by the fishermen the different member otherwise will be interpreted and applied
also therefore can a  fisheries which all in a the employment the the fisheries working fishermen involved be ensure ensure that the rules all honest be applied
this report is precisely the time the  both not only in the irish sea but in all waters the the united kingdom
few years ago when the house in london a agreement  which a end was the the  between the united kingdom and iceland was that the document cod that all understanding to over is mentioned
hope the this report the start the the restoration the the  in the irish sea and opens the the way to the future
mrs the president gentlemen ladies and gentlemen first like i the mr nicholson you thank for are excellent report
i like him same assure that i very certainly prepared am to to the fishermen to listen certainly because i that on two weeks in ireland will are and this very intensive contacts discussions and discussions with the local fishermen and the whole sector will have
you you very good the the informed the the proposal i think that the not more need is to the here to discuss
i i therefore right in the the amendments and must you unfortunately say that i the few problems i
what the the amendments and the the have the the  support there are two reasons why the commission not can agree with this amendments
the first the is here to a text on technical measures and a text on technical measures is not the appropriate document to also still provisions on  support in the to take
the second and that is still important the are the member the the on the regulation must decide or they the fishermen for the temporary interrupt the the fishing  support offer or not
the two other amendments and cut the future assessment the the regulation the and are for the commission to the next reasons problematic the first reason is that everyone the commission the authorities in the member and also the fishermen itself the regulation the january the the next year in force want let act
any delay the the force must i i be avoid
the second was this regulation up the basis the the results the meetings with fishermen scientists and officials and we are the plan to this meetings also in the future continue to to as the crisis in the cod expressions
that can than very certainly to a assessment the the now the to to measures and conditions lead
i request you therefore us the this point to confidence
we will us in the practice the the  the
to the regulation however as quickly possible in force to let act can i not agree with this amendment
i thank you for your understanding
mrs the president i i with large interest to the answer the the mr fischler listened
can he i say what port he like visits   or 
he said that he the fishermen was who
i would the like present are
i would with him want go and with the fishermen speak
can he i say when he the ports is visits
mrs the president i i said that i to ireland i and further also still to scotland and i i the the the governments and authorities the ground left to the programme together to to and also from to choose with what fishermen i a meeting will have
therefore can i that the this at not change but you you the i invited to i if you you to hand
mrs the president i like this debate not enables but i the horrific suspicion that the mr fischler not to northern like to but that he perhaps the a visit like to the a another part the the irish island that with northern nothing to make has
northern makes part from the the united kingdom
if he to northern like to to there the fishermen to visits would i like with him go
mr fischler give i however not not answer as you just you done
that can i not accept
if you this the the fishermen like defend can you that do but this i i not that
i request you yourself not in such a situation to to
fisheries is something which we all help both in the north if in the south the the island
am of not political issue to make
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
 access to the 
the the item is the report a the the mr clegg behalf the commission industry external trade research and energy on the proposal for a regulation the the european parliament and the council on  access to the  com c cod
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen the is for i always a pleased here programmes night late comfortable to can debate
when i rapporteur was for something  if  access to the  was i certainly not that this a as controversial and complex issue was and also not that us debate as late in the evening to a you would be the
the regulation on the  access to the  is a important document legislation they is the completion the what in the past  is has but also a important step to the future
the regulation  what in the past  is has because they the last employment the the telecommunications that the the previous european measures was no now also may for the competition
also the the regulation ensure that the access to the  the last kilometres  for all new can the opened and not the exclusive halfcentury the the socalled established operators remains the regulation will the choice the the area the not for intercept intended services for the consumers strong enlargement
the regulation will also the consumer do fall new  encourage and the europe the way to a dynamic future to
the the way will the regulation also help to the promise after to to the in march the this year in lisbon was done when a number ambitious objectives were formulated to ensure to ensure that the gap between the european union and the united states the the area the the economy as quickly possible the narrowed
to as quickly possible the the conclusions the the summit the lisbon and the proposal the the commission the july to respond had we a unusual procedure follow
i i heard that if we tomorrow on the report vote and the adopt as the in the commission is approved this regulation the document legislation will are that the institutions the the european union the fastest to the have the
that was only possible by a cooperation the ever was than ever
i think in the first place the the cooperation with the commission i thank the mr liikanen and are excellent staff for their never indeed aid during the whole procedure
they have us really all invaluable services proven
i thank also the council for the good cooperation in the first place the basis the the mandate in the conclusions the the summit the lisbon but also the basis the a series effective initiatives the the french presidency in the council finally thank i also for the cooperation in this parliament
i i the honour and the pleased had to can work with members the all groups the in the commission have involved the the report which we tomorrow vote
i thank them all for the excellent way which we have worked
this was not easy difficult in the first place because the procedure new and difficult is
all the this have involved know that if this a precedent the we perhaps a number rules must the to us work to facilitate but also a number content rules
this measure will for a number established operators certainly embarrassing are i i there understanding for that a number colleagues with established operators discussions have held and am their grateful that they i their  have presented and together with i a way have sought
we should proud are the what we have done i hope that we us work tomorrow the the vote will finish
from this everything that that the parliament even the difficult and controversial policies decisions is and if that need is clear decisions can take i thank again all the this have involved
mr the president first like i the rapporteur thank
he has in this difficult process excellent work done and we should account bearing with the by the  caused problems the both the timetables for the new legislation if the parliamentary debate very satisfied are with the now reached compromise
the is for the consumers the most that the regulation immediately beginning next year the force the
there is really almost the because the free price the the local networks is a the the cornerstones the the development the the european society
i am especially satisfied on the fact that the parliament the council and the commission in the are been closely with other together to work and the constructive way on this complex matter to debate perhaps the for the first with as many agreement
if the parliament hope tomorrow in the spirit the the reached consensus the report favour as i think and hope is the the turn the the council
the free competition the local telephone benefit especially the internet
pace in the marketopening have to now to  in account the
the european consumer has in the worst case for are internet a ten time higher price must pay than the american consumer
a fall the the prices reduces for the people the threshold to internet the the daily doing to involve
example the immensity opportunities the the electronic trade to now better in the scope the the europeans
the a reduction the the local  benefits everyone also they the not interested are in the use the the computer or internet
the national provision bodies are there in large extent responsible for that the suited with a monopoly also the last  for new companies in the sector to opening
the is to expect that some pace with artificial jiggerypokery the their competitive try the to the
this must with hard hand against be in
the must pace considerable expenses let pay if they mozambique with the liberalisation the their networks
only the the way can the the the the free competition beginning next year certainly to
behalf my group hope i that the vote the tomorrow positive process were the council the the is and that we the new legislation with the year can apply
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues i thank the mr clegg for are excellent work
although are history the last time a somewhat special genuinely has taken like i him however thank
the the commission is the a important and good achievement that must said be
there is now a record down the a area which the development as quickly is that records applicable are
the liberalisation the local networks is a rapid way the by the treaty the amsterdam possible is made we use the now because we otherwise any day many money would lose the to high prices and the activities would among
in few weeks are we the the in the commission industry with this matter have been the managed under leadership the the rapporteur with both the commission if the council to negotiate on this proposal that tomorrow certainly unamended the adopted
this am i the the convinced
we have in the practice therefore same discussed with the commission the council ourselves and many others and now is a result achieved which we us not need shame
local networks are to my opinion the the bottleneck in the european market been and now disappears he if he not disappears can the national authorities intervene and if the prices not good are than to there compensation
consumers and companies have millions behind other lost because to high prices
now to the prices the both telephone if the rapid crossborder and  in very europe reduce
that is precisely for the consumers a good measure and the help also us
networks must under fair and nondiscriminatory conditions be liberalised
that is very important
the the other on have we there the the revisions the the parliament account that taken that the owners or unspeakable the networks not without money continue are they must reasonable income for their work to and also their future investment in networks must possible are
a problem the the future infrastructure is that the privacy less the because now all  the a licence to to in  and centres to to this their own equipment can them
the the way is the traditional secret the the telephone the the disappear
the auction the spectrum is other a opposite development
they increase the consumer and has to a certain chaos the the market led
as i said increase they the consumer and the is wait what there will done with the mobile thank the the fourth and fifth generation
states lose their ability the matter in good jobs to lead
the is now already as that the  development a large flight the with if result that the market directly the divided
the is in netherlands and just in italy happened that there the the auction only just as many participants were if there licences to obtain are
therefore is there there the a type agreement the means that the market in fact not more work
i i for that the commission now there so information is on what this all means a statement right
this development is opposite the what we now with the regulation want achieve
mrs the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes according the communist party the greece is the telecommunications the strategic important therefore can the driving here not the profits the the monopolies are
the general policy the the european union is all sectors the the economic life in hands to play the the large capital with the before regulation the the probably most part the  mercy the the monopolies
this are enormous sums the public for spent and now the this for a appeal and a amiss elsheikh the telecoms need because only but the  and operational costs to to
the argument that the this way new services will be created refers no the such services can because just as good be developed by the current telecoms
the european commission and the council make this sector however not as but on the the private capital they do that with a regulation the immediately the application will are and the really with remarkable almost is tabled
i i can the gentlemen mr programmes here very useful conclusions allocate and especially the next the there not few doubt more whose interests the european union must
mrs the president i put tribute the the mr clegg the the last weeks very hard has work to a balanced report the to to that the  the the different groups in the commission industry external trade research and energy reflect
i am welcome that in the by the commission approved text account the taken with two points the i very important think
the first point is a fair dominant the second the universal services in the framework the the further opening the the  for the competition
i think the important that the changes the a controlled way done so all involved the time have to the the to apply and the rights the all consumers be guaranteed
the is clear that we the all agree must are with the improvement the the existing  to the benefit the the new technologies to can enjoy
in my country want we a as good possible  to new investment the to draw
investment in our infrastructure are essential for the further success and the further growth the the irish economy ireland like a  the electronic trade be
important is also that all citizens same results the the improvement the the  can them
the opening the the   for the competition must ensure ensure that all  in all cities and villages be improve
we must prevent that new players only the  in the greater cities improve
what the fair tariffs the must for the access to the  a price can be asked the the glossed costs reflect and a margin for  offers
in that the i i with pleased the that the commission the agree agree is that the in the past made costs the the calculation the the tariffs in eligible be taken
we must ensure ensure that the existing  for the opening the the  the adequate way be compensation
i think that the national regulatory body the a fair way between the existing operators and the new networks must can mediate
i think this a good and balanced text
i thank the mr clegg that he to the speeches the so the are colleagues has want listen
mrs the president mr the commissioner the special european council the lisbon has a strategic objective for the european union the the most competitive and dynamic economy the world be
to this assertion in the practice to to must they in the first place followed be by measures the the markets liberalisation the competition promote and therefore new operators the the market the the services and in the particularly internet allow
the commission and the european authorities have not always in agreement with the statements the lisbon action the proposal for a directive on ecommerce will example with the objective or the excuse the discrimination the european  to end the development the ecommerce in very europe programme
this the however in quickly pace change the and to the seems with good results
our rapporteur the mr clegg has good work made he has the proposal the the commission clarification and answered and the conditions created for a rapid conclusion the the legislative many the us hope this and tomorrow will also we us this express
nevertheless like i the the opportunity use to the commission as possible to warn when this regulation is the must other obstacles for a real introduction and liberalisation the the last mile in services be tackled
in my country italy are the conditions for the liberalisation the the last mile already long present but specific implementing by the national authority for telecommunications with particularly the the the  to the local just let still the the wait
in the case the italy but also in other european countries is this probably to due the the power the the established operator the the liberalisation so possible trying to delay
the is to important lucrative bundling and in italy is there a alignment between the the if regulatory body and the the if owner or countryside the few the the most telecoms
mrs the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues as the previous speakers already have said enter we with the regulation on the  the the  a new area
we have for the first the up procedure followed the in the treaty the amsterdam is for the means that a second reading scrapped the left
the intention of is that we the regulation on  quickly adopt so the market for local thank already the the end the the year for competition can be opened
from the first experience with this procedure that that the only for very certain exceptional suitable is the the other on and this am i course very welcome that that the also in this parliament possible to are to on a as important subject if the  quickly a legislative the to to
without the commitment and the involvement the  clegg had this regulation never as quickly in the commission and here in the plenary sitting can be dealt
hope will they tomorrow also be adopted the rapporteur has different positions still know to reconcile and has the also in the council for the parliament used
best  the again you thank for you fantastic achievement
why have we this regulation need
although the european market since fully is liberalised is the socalled last mile or the  actually still always in hands the the established operators
the regulation is intended to also the the last mile for competition to ensure
only if also in that  real competition there can rapid and crossborder access to internet and  the den duration be guaranteed
that is not only the dream the any  but also a binding need in the age the the new economy
in large parts the europe see the reality there currently still otherwise from the  process difficult the  is during the surf occupied television is duration and the is slowly
according recent into had beginning but europeans access to  while that there in the usa already million were
the european commission has therefore rightly decided this problem quickly to overcome
political about there there according i not alternative for the unamended adopt the this regulation which the last tied from the way the overcome
mrs the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues also i like  clegg for the intensive cooperation thank
i can this a  example the give he complex are compromise the i for when i in own country the the motorway was
i am course  into and i when further with him like
that the think i good the how we this have work
we are best prepared that in the followup also as to do but we would the and to perhaps a little longer the time can take to certain points still step to deal
us was a political objective for view we wanted competition still once and final enforceable to the way to the society to towards
the competition the the local sight would by this regulation in decisive extent must increase so example internet a better access to the  to the community will the increase
this proposal will end also the society promote
more and cheaper citizens is however nothing worth if the content there
the society must especially to the be the by in people and their skills to invest
the is a important given that the regulation just if the the original liberalisation the the telecommunications a asymmetric regulation is
that is a good approach has to competition in to to
in the future will this regulation however disappear and will we competition to apply in that respect is amendment that is the new recital commission very important because the again the stressed that the regulation within not already to long time by a new legal framework the replace
the is least as important that the council the socalled tc not massacre
i am that that the council this regulation soon will adopt and that we the treatment the the rest the the package quickly and seriously will continue
i hope that the council us the not in the abandoned late and that this or particular member the not be involved
we have with us work the good example given
we are the quickly and the a good way with other agree become and i hope that the council this also in will succeed
mrs the president the mr clegg said earlier that this a controversial and complicated work is we have there therefore good the done him to rapporteur to appoint
he has during the whole time demonstrated given the large million i like there the parliament also the point that he while he the  with success  by to married also with success a own  has the
we congratulate him all
the will the parliament certainly not surprised that i if member the the british conservative party the conservative government has british radio already more than year ago privatised probably the first large  in europe extremely welcome am with this necessary measure to the market the reducing and open to to
extremely important is that the commission this with this  the basis has the we able its commitment and fighting to that to do
if i see how little identity some provisions on the timetable are formulated example that  with commit the december the the reasonable ask the the beneficiaries must like would i the commissioner want ask us the insurance to give that the commission this strict will ensure the has because not sense that we this text adopt if the member him then slow and the unclear way out
i like there also the point that this although a admiration initiative if result the the summit the lisbon is but that in lisbon also a number other important aspects for the promotion the the new economy were mentioned
who is already the new cheap and unregulated capacity use
we want that new entrepreneurs and new internet to the market to
i remind the commissioner remind that a the the other important points in lisbon was that in the european economy new conditions must be created to new investors the to draw
i congratulate him with the sense for tour the we here the and the we the commission perhaps not always can when i request him with same fighting and determination also the other aspects the lisbon effective the to tackle
mrs the president in the first place congratulate i the mr clegg with the speed which he this excellent report has up i is him also welcome in the free exclusive comfortable the members the here often programmes night late on the problems in the with telecommunications debate
the predecessor the the mr liikanen the mr bangemann mentioned us ever we happy  we brethren under other
he  the sisters but you understand doubt what he with this quote the shakespeare order
this is a an and historic at and the to different reasons in the first place is everything after the summit the lisbon very quickly has
in the second place appreciate we the technical consistency the the measure the parliament must new the imaginative very and as the mr harbour said  methods develop
we must however also clear say when such measures appropriate are the is almost certainly that the other parts the this last telecom more time will require and the a  way will be dealt
i like also something say on a extremely important aspect the the proposal the the mr clegg namely the powers the the national regulatory bodies and the  that is according i extremely important for the early and consistent application the this regulation
others had the already on the summit the lisbon this regulation follows course continue from the promise the the member the the european union that they the growth and the use the internet in europe in the framework the the eeurope will support
without the commitment to for affordable rapid citizens to ensure would of not many into the  the the  is important for the success the the initiative
thanks the joint efforts the commission parliament and council is this regulation to the in the framework the the general effort to the telecommunications to modernise
the effort will for openness transparency and competition in the sector ensure and a balance to the to between the need the regulation and the expect to liberalisation
there is however still more legislation we must learn draw from the many legislation the we during many years together to the have the
we have always  look to learn to draw from what we had done before we to the future its and did to councils what us was
we have in this quickly changing market mistakes made but i would to decision want say that if europe competitive like continue the benefits the eeurope the all citizens the the european union like offer and the the area the the third generation etc are head the the united states like retain we us all together must make to ensure to ensure that all measures be carried
mrs the president the  the the access to the  must competition possible make the prices for the user do fall the access to internet easier and cheaper make and the technological renewal the the  promote
i welcome the promised developments
as the rapporteur said have many the us the  the the local  learn know
 the irish  says that he sufficient time must to to the changes from to to and that december almost not feasible is
also must the compensation for the mcommerce access to the  honest and appropriate are to the development and improvement the the local  the long term to guarantee
if the financial not feasible is in less close its and less developed areas to invest will we perhaps not new operators can attract
if we this possible scenario combine with other measures the for the rural counterproductive consequences have as the liberalisation the the postal which the existence the small post the the rural the threatened and the recent closure the many small  the the rural how can the possible  the the investment in the development and improvement the the local infrastructure the the now already disadvantaged rural the long term than a positive influence have
i hope sincerely that my fear not been the i hope that we in the future can prevent that the debate in the parliament drastically the cut by the procedures to up for issues the end especially for the most vulnerable under us heavy consequences have
mrs the commissioner mrs the president gentlemen mr programmes the what foreign term the the proposal which we evening debate the  access to the  a total incomprehensible term for the average citizens moreover refers the a simple and important decision to local  and telecommunications and  open to to for the free competition
according some mr programmes that have we evening still heard lead the abolition the this last monopoly automatically to lower prices for local telephone and can this only but positive are for the consumer
for others and i am to the group is this many less obvious and course
if a unlimited competition any to permanent price would lead and always positive would are for all consumers than would that already long clear are
the market the the mobile thank the completely free is shows fact the opposite
the real prices for mobile profits continue high and the only transparency in the costs and prices is not there
between the advertising and the reality problem not gap but a whole 
many citizens are of still any day the victims can their account not more pay and give their negative than but if stolen the
moreover am i for a  access but there must the very quickly simple clear and binding rules to to the extent to determine the development to hand and the financing the this service to clarifying
our rapporteur and mr  clegg has course hard work and this congratulate i him
he was very open in the discussion with are mr programmes and this thank i him
but he is very liberal and has therefore also everything rejected what in the direction the a real general service would can to
he is  for monopolies than for reflects
i hope therefore that the directive universal service which i in july behalf the commission industry to rapporteur was appointed and that i now despite the attempt the the legal commission would must back the matter what more direction can give
the mr clegg has the proposal the the commission on a  access technical correctly reflect
he has the matter very seriously tackled but however think i that he to little attention has for the risk the reflects and for the risk that the weakest and most vulnerable citizens in as such reverence system are
i repeat evening still but agree that the public services not slowly should disappear the benefit the the market
they must and can for us europeans a objective the the are a gentlemen and a gone in a balanced and sustainable development
moreover mrs the president since the three european institutions the agree are on a  access like i not counts than the pope are and will i tomorrow for vote
mrs the president mr the commissioner i i here the documents for i are which we this week to vote
i think that the most report that the the mr clegg is because the immediately is demonstrated that decisions quickly and the handle way can be taken
i think that we that if example for the european process must use if the new developments arise must the right decisions quickly and the a you  way be taken
i like the rapporteur congratulate because the him managed is all they in a direction to to
i like however also the commission thank because they the task the the council to this subject with urgency to deal as efficient and qualified has carried
i think that we with this steps really a new development the favour the european citizens era
the european citizens will the not only cheaper from are but will also the the quality the the services and the the market see that the international competitiveness the europe by this steps increasing
we know that there with  new services the us work
the environment and the telecommunications will in the future the large importance are for the international competitiveness i think the therefore important that we fair macroeconomic determine
from the directive that that the precise has  what honest is and that is a exemplary approach the the process
legislation should to the to to after a review a proper and thorough assessment which all involved be heard finally follows than a good efficient rapid and precise procedure in the european parliament
i like the rapporteur again the i thank
mrs the president obviously am i the only the here at refers
normal about take i here not position in that only the national considerations supports but now i i the impression that this regulation not few flexibility offers and with the situation in ireland completely not account the
by this proposal will  a private company and used  to be forced are  for other suppliers open to to the other the the market present suppliers as  and operators the satellite and wireless  need that however not
they the not under the application the this regulation
the  in ireland are now already owners the the network and improve that network to telephone internet and other interactive services to can offer
often let they vast areas by exclusive  operate
in ireland have the companies in the greater cities and local a market the approximately many more than  
we can impossible understand and find the completely unacceptable that the proposal also not the  the has
also will the established  as  impossible with the companies can compete because the in the framework the their  the users joint services offer including often also citizens and free local thank
where addition the  a competitive network there must all  be  or not only
that would in agreement are with the justify the the commission for the  withdrawal
this regulation on  access to the  is itself uneconomic
the worst legislation is usually bad legislation that applies also for this regulation
mrs the president  are not always the  what we in the european parliament witnessing but i must say that here evening a extremely positive and interesting debate is held
i am the agree with the speakers the this a historic at have mentioned
this is to two reasons a historic regulation
in the first place is the to the completion the the liberalisation the the telecommunications
that is also important for the universal services
a greater competition the the networks will the prices do fall the quality do increase and the services  make
also will they us help to a  society to the to to
in the second place is this a historic at because we a answer have given the the often set question or europe to slow is to to act
are we in the the opportunity to intervene the the information us offers
on there large doubt
can the institutions the the community the challenge the
if the parliament tomorrow the report the the mr clegg favour proof we that we that indeed can
we can let see that we in this time the internet act are
we can that specific proof and the the credibility the the european union strong strengthen especially in the view the the person generation the in the intrusion live
this everything would without the excellent cooperation between the institutions impossible are
i thank the rapporteur the mr clegg for the excellent work that he has done but also all other members the the commission
this result would without thorough knowledge the the dossier impossible been are
we would this result also never have achieved without the willingness to with many partners to negotiate
i thank also the presidency the the council that determined was this regulation to the to to
in many member is this a sensitive and complex issue
the mr gallagher and the mr haarder have on few comments made
the is indeed important for the eeurope that the market the liberalised to the prices to do fall and the services to improve
that is however only one side the the coin
we have also trained and qualified people need the the the services use can make
we must therefore in the training the young and old continue invest
what the application the the regulation the have the national regulatory bodies yesterday with officials the the commission meeting
they have agree agreed the implementation the the regulation the a as harmonised possible way to up to in this sector a strong european market to the to to
the commission is the almost with the whole content the the report agree
the rapporteur supports the objectives and measures in the proposal
i like there of but three mention
in the first place want we operators the the the area the fixed  not significant dominant posts force to permission give to under transparent nondiscriminatory and  conditions from december mcommerce access to to to the metals 
to the transparency by other operators to guarantee will we in the second place a  must publish for the access to the  and the the linked facilities as  and dominant under the monitoring the the national regulatory bodies to a fair approach to guarantee
i i with pleased the that the national regulatory bodies want help to that all to achieve
finally will the rules on the  access to the  the possible make that new players all types access can offer where that technical feasible is as fully  and shared access to general and specific 
that the for technical renewal more competition and a greater choice for the users
the commission the all amendments the the report the the mr clegg on
the amendments the a improvement in the the proposal and ensure for  technical produce and more demands the the national players and regulatory bodies
already the amendments are constructive and will ensure ensure that the regulation fully operational the
the the way guarantee they that the  from december quickly and effective be 
the commission hopes that the council the text will approve as he in the report is amended and hope tomorrow by the parliament will be adopted
the council can the codecision than in one few reading finish
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to at closed
statement the the president
mrs the president my intervention is on the situation in ivory
this week have we not urgent
after serbia has yesterday the population the ivory with its opposition against the military junta and the accusation the abusive elections let see what the democracy its worth is
i think that you the mr laurent  winner the the in this country taken elections behalf the european parliament a  and support must send
that will i like do mr barón barón
vote
 the the sections i ii iv v vi vii and viii the the draft the general budget for on the european parliament the council the court the justice the court the economic and social committee the committee the the region programmes and the ombudsman
before the vote
the greens open yellow umbrella programmes with the saving  change the president
although the geel very good with the the blue the our torn like i you however ask your umbrella programmes close to from so we on our budget can vote the a way the us parliament dignified is
wynn pse president the the committee
and mrs the president as you just already said the this a longterm process
normally try we the vote on the budget to streamline to there as quickly possible through to to
we are now however with a large number amendments
i respect fully the democratic right the the members the the parliament to amendments in to must but i must them the warn that if amendments be adopted the not part of the the general agreement between the groups we over the ceiling start from to to than must we the vote stop
we have in essentially not few category a margin
you must the aware that if this vote otherwise the than planned i or mrs haug perhaps the a given at must who to the vote to put
than must we namely look what further still in vote the can be
i i fact two ask
the first request is at the the mr programmes the the committee they have more than amendments tabled
the note the amendment will before the second reading the table are and than will we final decisions on the 
therefore would i them want ask this amendments in to draw that would us a hope time save
also like i the mr heatonharris and are mr programmes questions to their amendments in to draw
also that would us even many time save
i must fact say that the amendments a document better are than the amendments the the mr heatonharris and are mr programmes in the commission have tabled
we should therefore fact the grateful are that there now still but amendments are however would i withdrawal of the very existence
that will the voting considerably up
mrs the president the mr wynn was a comment on the number amendments that my commission would have tabled i must him that attention that this part part the the democratic process
mrs the president now have we however the one question still not answer been namely or the commission agriculture and rural prepared is are amendments in to draw
i would that like want since that the the problem is
if we namely one amendment adopt you know that my mr programmes know that i i the more than agree said to we were already against the interinstitutional agreement in because we than namely the margin for payments exceed
you you perhaps still a time someone the the committee questions
mrs the president i understand the  the the rapporteur but with the amendments the the commission agriculture and rural the there not only on money voted but also on a certain direction
from the amendments that what the committee like and we are unfortunately not in the to they in to draw we will they in vote to and see what the parliament agree does
we the the committee find the amendments good wellconsidered and can they therefore not withdraw
i hope that i here also am behalf the other coordinators
the answer is clear mrs haug
you you therefore compromise submit
president we must course as each year and the any the the the budget still ex vote on few technical corrections
the the last at have there still negotiations place with all groups and the five points like i if rapporteur few corrections explain
first is the to line b to the information
this are the groups agreed to in the line to places and in the reserve to let and not to everything as the the last vote in the reserve to places
same applies the line b for the many prince
this want we now also in the line and in the reserve places
the line b for the bureau for medicines in london want we now million more for the bureau in london pay because we have recognised that the now a greater task has with the drugs
therefore bureau for medicines plus million
the fourth line the the socalled treaty reserve
here have we by the technical adaptation two lines in the reserve placed after we the treaty reserve in the committee have decided for this two lines were already at not sums more but only still a 
the the the lines b and b
this have the the the cooperation in the baltic and the  the the balkans
the last line the the this compromise the the groups should is a
this has the the the international european 
the must everything in the line be budgeted and will there therefore not reserve more there same must the resources with euro be increased to million
this are the technical changes
they are as with the groups agreed and i request you this point before the vote on the budget to places so we on the package can to vote
mrs the president best mr programmes the the administrative budgets is the matter something easier but also here must we the a line possibly a technical correction out on the what the parliament this certainly i like you than also ask to to vote for adaptation the line a acquisition the  goods
this adaptation is on the the amendments the be adopted we want namely the by ourselves imposed reduction to the the total the administrative expenditure not exceed
i think that this here in the parliament as the use is and i would welcome are if you for would vote
i i a proposal received the the mr wurtz to overall rejecting the the general budget for
mrs the president the is already know what the result the the next vote will are but we want this issue like the the item to
the issue that in our resolution is out will us the whole budgetary and even then continue head
if that that our fear develop was hope i that irrespective the result the this vote all mr programmes the our ambitions for europe parts the behind us will already
i put the proposal to overall rejecting the the general budget for in vote
i put you in remind that this proposal only can be adopted the basis the a qualified majority
the parliament rejected the proposal before the vote on amendment
president we have in block voted
the is a amendment the the liberal group to the  with million euro to increase
i note here that there proposals are to the budget to reduce
the question is how the that with other linked but also is i completely not clear that in block thanks the liberals this increase is proposed and then under amendment a number members from the group the same liberals proposed the whole budget to delete
the is disdain a way the liberal political companies which the  not know what the holding does disdain this is not coordination
we can however not the one at for a increase vote and the other for a reduction
i think the also a little  if i honest am
i request you such comments future scrapped to let
before the vote on amendment
mrs the president ilisu like the mr maat same say if i
we have namely this tomorrow still with other about
amendment the the committee has the the two lines in category b
the is the to young farmers and measures
i like now a oral amendment submit to the this line something to change
we give the young farmers million more and delete this million the the measures
that is assistance but we to than the meet the the commission agriculture and rural
president i can you only inform that the committee the proposal the the rapporteur fully supports
there is a request to presentation the a oral amendment
who makes there objection against the in recital take the this oral amendment
since more than members objection have the the oral amendment rejected
mrs the president than must the amendment if proposed by the committee unfortunately in vote be the
you know all that there unfortunately enough not margin is and already at not in b
this is namely zero margin

mrs the president perhaps can you us clarification give on the next amendment the the group if i this good read means adoption the this amendment that our travel be compensation against the real costs
i wanted only certainly know that i this good read perhaps will that certain mr programmes encourage to a another vote
gentlemen mr all mr programmes here can read
mrs the president my name the under many amendments the this report
i like the parliament only assure that i not only amendment i signed
in this case i i i not behind the italian delegation supported
we will that correct mrs lambert i i for to now to the vote on to to
before the vote on amendment
mrs the president to my large sorry i i against the budget must vote i think namely that there in the budget not posts are which appropriations for the improvement the the living the elderly and pensioners be aside or better said the posts are there at not
also i i given that a large number the this funds for is for the famous community action programmes
i believe not that this programme programmes a useful way are to the community funds to to
according i must the european union the way which they the money the the fifteen member paying radical change
if the european parliament actually a parliament was and if europe still something otherwise was than only a monetary irrefutable than had the european budget more than the the gdp should sums so we the systems had can harmonise and the energy and transport had can coordinate
a common  had in that case the basis must forms for this budget
but let we not rainbow build
the current europe the dominated by the neoliberal idea according what the aid and the structural to a minimum limited must be
there the priority given the the structural reforms the in practice the further privatisation and deregulation possible must make we would there however better the do the speculative capital to control
the real surprise the this budget is m in the external actions this advise egoism and rashness
europe has a special responsibility with the to the balkans and the region the south the the mediterranean sea
if we the relatively modest support the for the our richest countries would use to the peace and development the this region programmes to promote would this support many simpler the nature can are we have however elected for a dangerous form the unipolar
to the reason have we for rejecting the this budget and against the proposed guidelines voted
in the vote on the budget have we consistent against the proposals the the commission on a increase the the agricultural in category voted
the reason this is that the money the the eu to our opinion better the other areas spent can be where the really need is
the is not reasonable that approximately the half the the total budget each year the production and  the agricultural the spent
the current common agricultural the the eu costs us not only many money but higher the prices for the consumers also the informed in
by the subsidies must the  against low prices the the market dumped be what the food in many developing in a adverse competitiveness puts
the is remarkable that the union still still support its the the tobacco
the activities and the budget the the eu must other be used for crossborder problems the the member only not can solve
the  with are exports and aid must therefore be halted and to the certain informed replace be by support the biological diversity and measures
with the to the external measures in category vote we for a vision the not revision the the financial perspectives presupposes
for us is support the the democratic movement and the reconstruction the the balkans a the the most priorities the the eu must to
especially for a improvement the the situation in serbia must aid be taken
now already a revision the the financial perspectives expect is a unfortunate choice
a revision the the financial plan the to our opinion the risk in that the while on the general increase what the this at not desirable is
the parliament must there therefore for ensure that the interinstitutional agreement respected the and that the budget within the framework the the financial plan remains
we are the opinion that the resources the the programme programmes the category the today not the full use be for the balkans can be used
with through the the flexibility can also resources be budget
to my pleased recognises the parliament that there addition the european lobby the course a important lobby is for certain  also other lobby programmes are the european level the both economic if political support deserve and must to
no in the parliament would agree with discrimination the women if the women however not the right the their voice to let hear does the their a form the violence the
the committee has also this year again decided that this a  is and the destination the the appropriations the postal a for only one organisation unacceptable is therefore must this line be opened for other disincentives
as the situation now is is and remains the  the only suffer the this line for disincentives
other organisations the also thousands european women represent to the not in eligible for subsidy they are therefore not represented
the shows the democracy and the subsidiarity but a service by the  a monopoly to to know and control to give on very the line for women
if we the vote the the european women equal  want offer must we a end make the this exclusive support
any elected member has to task ensure to ensure that the  their voice clear can let hear
if we the different vote the the european women want hear must we a end make the this  the the subsidies
we must all the european ideals the democracy and  uphold and resistance offer the any pressure the the groups the a antieuropean monopolies control want maintain
we are the opinion that the ceiling the the budget absolutely not exceeded must be
the member must the resources the the available budget then so there sufficient economic resources are for additional support the the balkans
if the member the really want can they to our opinion in the budget the we today deal certainly available resources find the not used be
the members the the league nord have against the budget voted not because we against the european ideal are but to to protest against the distorted way which that ideal the applied
although the citizens in formal very a europe with attention for their wish for their needs their interests in the prospect the the is during the vote the today the opposite has
mr programmes we know all that the west the the po recently by floods is affected the are people to the life has and is serious damage caused
the that last is unfortunately nothing more to do but aid were necessary and decent
but this parliament that always attention has for the needs the peoples the outside the union has the hostile up when the own citizens by a disaster were affected and the amendments voted the a few million euro for them 
therefore have we against voted
haug a
i i against the haug and for the proposal the my group to rejecting the the general budget voted because
the first the extent the the budget the the european union not up the the enormous financial needs the the society the the fifteen and the with particularly the most regions countries and region programmes
the second the new appropriations for the reconstruction the yugoslavia the not only necessary are but even being must the result are the considerable highly the the appropriations for  agriculture social expenditure etc and not the a increase the the budget what the countries the the european union the moral grounds compulsory would are been given the fact that they itself have involved the the destruction the the former yugoslavia
the third the budget a mechanism is for the application the a policy that characterised the by social shortcomings and shortcomings the the area the the development a policy that but not review the despite the warnings by the fall the the euro
the swedish and danish social vote for the draft the general budget the the eu for the year that the parliament has up
the draft creates a good balance between the necessary budgetary and the possibility for the eu important activities the implement to to
in relationship to the economy the the member is the budget according the proposal the the council the least extensive since more than ten year
the parliament like the budget somewhat increase but we have still a broad margin before the ceiling achieved is
the parliament is there however in managed a number important priorities it to to including more resources for the fight the unemployment and poverty a number important measures for the environment for equal opportunities etc
we vote against the rightwing attacks the the life and the european marches lobby
we are determined the necessary resources to find for the reconstruction and democratisation the the balkans even for serbia
therefore ask we the council positive to respond the the initiative the the parliament a common and sustainable solution to find before the final budget in december the adopted
a revision the the  for external actions category is not objective the the but we are this prepared if the need is to the necessary resources for the balkans to provide
we are critical the the extent and guidance the the 
here is a thorough reform necessary under more to place to make for the enlargement
the agricultural costs the eu many to many money
we have criticism the the overproduction the agricultural and the the campaigns the the eu its to the surpluses to sell
we have questions the the extensive support the the tobacco because we the believe are that this contrary is with the high ambitions the the eu the the area the health
we stress the important the a better implementation the the budget so we the large behind the certain areas can up
the  and the methods on openness revision and political control are urgent the improvement and modernisation to
we have itself proposals formulated on the socalled  but we accept that this time the the long jobs the been to a general solution for the problems with category found is
the parliament is however welcome with the proposal the the commission new lines to create for local and regional cooperation in the baltic in the framework the the preaccession phare
we vote also for the increase the the resources the for are for cooperation between  local because we this a important incentive find for the cooperation the local level within the union
with the to the  the the members the the european parliament continue we the us position that only the really made travel during us mandate for compensation in eligible to
we vote therefore for amendment the the group which this demand formulated is
the danish liberals are there favour the that the revision the the meps as quickly possible a solution offers for the compensation the travel more the that only really made costs compensation be
that is the only solution for the problem not a few bolstered comments the the budget
the public sector in the member is since several years the subject the long savings
in this the is the depressing the to to that many resources in the budget sources continue and that there in certain cases there is the pure money
if example the european parliament are meetings in strasbourg the friday ensure would we million euro save
in the european parliament the favour for the introduction the  the the european political parties
the is interesting the to to that the hearts there apparently not in succeed their own parties or the individual members the this parties the membership the a  to do pay which the forced is the hearts with public apply to finance
this shows the low motivation for the project even the the citizens the political active are
for the other take we distance the the large kurdishspeaking the the eu paying the subsidies regional support the management the the economic and social committee etc
the public resources the the eu spends can in the member the a  way spent be
rühle a
we have course against the budget the the ecsc voted because this to the the expiry the the treaty will act if  for the shareholders in the 
the employers have considerable subsidies been to other profitable affairs to start while many redundancies workers for always out will continue
in this budget the although proposed to money free to make for social support but this proposal is not with figures founded all workers the in the next time still redundancies must be will least the security must to that they their full salary to the their retired age will received
mrs the president best mr programmes the treaty the the end
nevertheless is there in germany a compromise closed on the  that the to and with the year
i i that from and i hope that the commission constructive without the appropriate solutions that we the three year between and with a transitional can help
however like i for the time after emphasise that in the eu not  the must be introduced the not by a authority the the european union the controlled
that is not solution for the future
this solution would damage seriously the the competition the the european union and same energy duration make especially also by the support the  forms what end harmful is for the posted europe
 a
mrs the president   a old and diseased women the the interested for the world the the electronic and for internet also because they the not can move has i asked its to help this electronic form the communication to understand they like namely a apparatus buying which they the through the telephone with internet can link
they has i asked i i not as many money because i many say am for medicines can i not free following the internet to
i i its said the the and therefore i i for the  voted thanks this report the the following the internet through the existing just namely cheaper
writing pt under the pretext the necessary promotion the the competition be we again faced with a attack the the public telecommunications the the area the fundamental basic for the population without that this only improvement the out services will
as in the report the mentioned the the  access to the  new suppliers in the the competition the to to with the examination operators by the offer the rapid  for a permanent access to internet and  the basis the digital  and the  the will use be made the local networks the already are built by other operators on the general operators the public services
hand occurred the almost the result the the decisionmaking during the summit in lisbon which the liberalisation the this very profitable proceed the implemented little good what the the protection the the interests the the consumers and the the workers in the sector
also this are motives to against to vote
we have against this report voted although the here only to a mere is in the process that the the the area the the telecommunications spirit
in the amendments the only but houses about on the socalled virtues the the competitiveness
by the  the the  will the public suited the very short term the public telephones the commercial companies must finland
the this way will to the the markets the private competition be subject
many suited including france  have already the this directive motion
the the staff be new demands the with particularly what the the commercial services also be the users in increasing extent the unequal way dealt
the the regulation the the sector are the your if recognise taken the territory is the classified in areas the in lesser or several extent profitable are
we have however need the a european public service the high level the in the fundamental needs the the workers and users provides in this public service must also the mobile phones and internet be included
with this policy can we the liberalism that under the french presidency all good employs a stop drain
the liberalisation the the telecommunications is in the eu already far progress
now the again a part the the  the discussion the following the speeds and clients the the 
that is the logical consequence the the to now to pursued 
but precisely because the is to the  must in the particularly account be taken with the interests the the clients
if the the the liberalisation the the local lines fact already is to the  make the the rapid internet the the future high  and low local  are this crucial than must also basic for all citizens guaranteed be
this can by a enlargement the the obligations the companies the the the with the universal services example by the normal speaker the this obligations to involve to the rapid internet to this everything with minimum the regard the  protection the the consumer supply and with special tariffs for certain social groups disabled people in the assistance and with a low income inhabitants the areas etc
since this with the under report not is guaranteed i i against the report voted
 peres a
mrs the president also in this case i i to my large sorry against must vote
why i i especially if representative the the party the the pensioners against voted
because tomatoes      etc since only time not more prevent the the table the my old and pensioner friends
the mediterranean diet that in italy as famous is is the the disappear
why
because the european union not in the is the  the and trade in  to encourage
we must our regulation fully change and last decisions farmers the their production want increase to support
the danish social vote against a report that a  for producers the processed products the basis the vegetables and fruit the
we support other the proposal the the commission the the difficult administrative procedures like abolish and the regulation easier and flexible like make
the commission is in fact many to kind for the producers
they the a minimal reductions for the the large  that the regulation to still to was
therefore support we the reported the the commission and are we against a further  the this sector
although the commission says a solution to want find for a number specific problems the they in fact a radical amendment for the the vegetables and  the report on the previous only in the force become regulations is however still not agree completed
the argument the the commission that with the proposed changes a solution the is for specific issues is by and by hypocrisy and misleading this this the common organisation the processed vegetable and fruit completely the amended this the worse for the small and mediumsized growers and better for the operators industries and multinationals
the commission the for the levy for the industrial  and  the to abolish under the pretext that the producer now direct support the although the levy the producer not full and adequate protection can offer is this however a certain they the than minimum valve
in place the this levy now to increase to the  actually to can assure like the commission this abolish
the to the operators and industrialists free stake they can than the farmers just so exploit if they want and abuse make the their work and their production
by the contributions the any demeaning low are the result the the had to the farmers in the temptation over the thresholds to produce with if result that the operators and industrialists with the contributions to suffering the farmers can there because at not certainly the are that they the over the thresholds produced quantities also the the market can sell
therefore are this  a additional weapon in the hands the the operators and industrialists the can they the farmers blackmailed and extremely low prices enforceable for very the amount also for the below the thresholds produced amount
the quotas and the thresholds are the a type scylla and scylla the change of brings the farmers the the rain in the worse
this to however the proposed highly the the  still the to for  to for  and  and to for the other vegetables and fruit the the 
to finally draft the commission for the the the the  use to must make the the to economic reasons high reexported the processed vegetables and fruit during the last  to low contributions the to to this contributions will however for many years valid are that like say to the next amendment the the regulation
the proposals for vegetables and fruit conform fully with the more general  atmosphere within the eu
the eu has decided the farmers being to prosecute with particularly the small and mediumsized farmers the the south and their products
therefore have we not message the improvements the the disastrous proposals the the commission as the proposed in the report the the parliament
this proposals must simply radical the the hand be out there must a radical towards the the agricultural be called a towards the the farmers and the rural right does
to the  in the cities safe to to is the price the the  already decades years artificial low taken
incinerators could only survive by able and 
that has they strong on made the borrowing capital
in the agricultural sector is now many money to but that that not guarantee for a good income and for 
my colleague salvador jové know everything the the bad position the the southern small farmers and workers
within the existing system the extensive subsidies looking he to a majority for a compromise that the survival for the group farmers better obligation
i am the with him agree if that lead to income for people with a to low income
my commitment is less money to the agriculture but there more to the poorest
the with not that europe more taxes under to the then the richest and best hemp companies to subsidising
the growing dutch  the the little productive a high yield the vegetables fruit and ornamental they the many more than the  and the find
now from annex iii that that the  not benefits the the proposed system for vegetable and fruit are my any time these
i i for this report voted since the line with the expectations the portuguese organisations in the vegetables and importance this they the opinion are that the common organisation in the sector vegetables and fruit extremely harmful is for the national interests have they a drastic change called
because the loss the the the  this year and the risk the still loss the the remaining quota for next year is for the portuguese agriculture revision the the organisation for the end the the year urgent is
in this report be proposals to the the on a number points which the important served the the the european production in the general and the portuguese in the particularly
the the the inflexibilities the the current system for processed products the basis the tomatoes the level the the guaranteed quantities for the processed products the basis the tomatoes  and you the complexity the the  and the management the the export
the portuguese government must now in not case admit and must the already this points the specific national interests to great and to sword defend
the would indeed absurd and disgraceful are if the european parliament the more right and the portuguese interests more addresses than our own government
nicholson a
mrs the president the is know that all measures for the fishing the different types fish i very the i to by the monitoring in mesh to increase can small  survive longer life waits be and who know the retired age achieve
that is however but a the the reasons why i not against this measure i voted
why
because i i abstained i because i think that in this case the subsidiarity not is applied as mr bushillmatthews and the english say
this  is a matter the the british belgians french and irish
i see not in why they not itself should decide on their fish and their fishing
 a
mrs the president a the my many friends under elderly and pensioners in italy and outside is a chinese this chinese retired live in hong hong
i i him the report the the mr treaties read and he said that is really a beautiful report
that is the reason that i although for this document i voted but in this vote however like emphasise that the good would are the next time to control and that to take how old pensioners in hong hong ensure are compared with old pensioners in the republic china to to see or this reunification for them become or adverse is been
 the van a
mrs the president the is the large important that the european union the concerns with the inhabitants the the acp in africa the caribbean area and the pacific atlantic
myself concerned i if representative the the party the the pensioners ensure on the situation the elderly in this areas
i must say that i the baringdorfs with the explanatory the page namely that there programme programmes must be set for education poverty and strengthening the the democratic institutions and the parliaments but that of in the proposals nothing is back to find
we can this countries only help if we the living the all inhabitants the the acp improve young the population and also elderly and pensioners a group the i after the the heart is
the is incredibly important that the eu the cooperation with acp the the armed conflicts involved are in reconsider the
we must there certainly the are that the assistance the we to not for military purposes the used
the member must however the possibility have to bilateral or through the commission support to to the the construction the a democracy in dictatorial countries
order corruption against to to must a training in good administration given can be and must the possible are opposition to support
we can paragraph not support because the if condition for the  the that the country in issue a good administration must to and the human and the principles the the rule must respect
moratorium the the implementation the the death b
my position on the death is still right the that the when régime françois mitterrand the the courageous way against the death sellafield later when he once to president was elected has he the death actually abolished
i was in opposed the the death and am that quadragesimo still still
i i understanding for the feelings and reactions the the families the victims the violence that often barbaric forms favour
however think i that a the not the right has to this atrocities with similar inhumane action to 
everyone know moreover that the  the the death taxable is therefore is the unacceptable that some countries the itself civilised mention as the united states the massive and systematic way the death continue out and the irreparable very serious legal mistakes can make
to the reason i i for the request to a moratorium the the implementation the the death voted
 da  a
the problem in the with the  the our planet is to due the the accumulation in the atmosphere the greenhouse as carbon this problem start a explosive extent to to
there are since the conference the kyoto still but good three year has and now already any the european agency that if the eu as continues with its emissions not only the reduction the the co with in the period impossible will will to are but there even a increase will place for the usa are the how even still criticism
the problem is to due the the fact that everything even the quality and the climate the sacrificed the the altar the the capitalism the capitalism winner the natural resources from and objective who after
therefore is the not more than normal that for the solution the the problem those must pay the this cause
the communication the the commission true content not the the the commission because not specific policies the for the reduction the greenhouse but limited they the as the rapporteur rightly has said to a discipline and a list the general policies
they confirms again its position that the  the the eu in the fight against greenhouse the must to be by a energy or a tax the fossil fuel
we are the not with this measure agree because the a violations application would are the the any already hypocritical principle the the polluter pays the costs the the  be than because directly the the consumers and therefore the the workers cars
because this problem extremely urgent is would the possibly a tax the fossil fuel in look can take provided this measure a supplement is the a integrated policy and the measures to reduction the the co and provided the yield the this tax only the good is the the workers
we are always already the opinion been that the reduction the the co and the other greenhouse paid must be by the real polluters that like say by the large industries let they but what the their who give
we are the moreover with the position the the rapporteur agree that absolute priority must be granted the renewable energy and the support the the public transport
we are further favour against the trade in  between companies and countries this is a amoral and fact trade
we can there with our hat not the that a whole market can the the   where the one company in place the are own emissions to reduce the remaining amount pollution the a other can well
in the capitalism can however everything bought and sold be even pollution
the european members the the communist party the greece are against the communication the the commission we have the appreciation for a number positive comments the the rapporteur and therefore vote we not against the report but abstained we us the vote
warming the the earth and extreme weather be in increasing extent caused by industry agriculture and transport
despite have the governments the the richest countries with the most emissions the fossil  mention this emissions drastically back to insist
rightly take the rapporteur the original proposal the the european commission not
kyoto was that from that the rich countries itself their air  already should they in limited extent the emissions the they elsewhere help reduce  the their own 
the member itself will their emissions the co and other greenhouse drastically must reduce by the emphasis to to the renewable energy public transport and reduction the the caroriented
the strong dismissing and cheap transport the goods on the way lead especially to movement the polluting industry the richer to poorer countries
 is not alternative because also the  the world the confuse greenhouse from and late other hardly degradable  after
i fear that the next  will be abused to the earlier agreed  the for the rich countries to restraining
the trade the shelves is perhaps interesting if experiment but not if real solution
 da  a
we are favour the any  the against the most polluters the large industrial companies affected the i think the with particularly the the pollution
we have us however the vote abstained because the tax business low is and the also not difficult is this  to paying this can the tax given be if only a modest premium in exchange for the right to to should pollute
to the pollution actually a stop to to can to will there binding measures affected must be if must the polluting company in up taken be
not only company must also the the measures be excluded the is however not only to effective measures the affected must be
pollution is a world problem that the whole society affects we can this problem than also only but the satisfactory way solve if the society over has the its economy and not only to private profit objective
i importance there very the a vote the to to on this report where i moreover for i voted because i like you like questions mrs the president or we the certainly know that the at climate by the human the industrialisation and the emissions the substances in the atmosphere be caused that question i myself also the
were there thousand thousand year ago when there still not industry was than not earthquakes  and other natural
mrs the president when was the tide
how industry was there when and how car programmes reason there
i would want that we us meetings or this climate really the the modern society and the industry to due are
the is a good matter that us parliament the again on the causes the the climate the our planet going and opinion
the is here to a particularly serious issue that the very short term must be tackled because the us all affects breathe we because not all same air in and be not all continents affected by storms excessive lead and 
we must the developed countries the current polluters and the less developed or underdeveloped countries the future polluters our the the seriousness the this issue
any attempt to the people the this problem aware to make must to be encouraged
that is the important the our resolution which i i i expressed
the industrialised countries must the fight the to made against the greenhouse that is their duty towards the peoples the the third world the the consequences the the global  already with their life must paid
by a international market the  to create will the western countries the the their responsibilities can mean by example by shelves the russia to buy or projects in the southern countries to finance or the projects answer the the  the this countries and or there a way there to to measure or the emissions actually is has plays than not few role
pollution is however not commodity
if we the pollution a source the profits make to we the door open for any form the abuse
in the resolution the favour for introduction the a system that the trade in  possible must make while the technical and legal aspects still not are  and the function and the efficiency the the system still must be where
there the not few control or  proposed
also like the the development the nuclear and the  outside the calculations on the  the
the european union must itself without the resources give to its commitments after to can to they must to a ambitious european programme the fight the the greenhouse the to take that many further goes than the policy and the measures the in the resolution be proposed
there must with particularly action be taken the the level the the transport
 a
mrs the president the the vote on the  i i i abstained
i i i abstained because i i given that there in this report just if in many other fact not good enough the observant and there not hard enough the work when there research the done as the the report on the fight the  disturbances
in bergamo where i from come suffering unfortunately many people the a  which the cause unknown is
the money for research in all fifteen member the the european union would the other must be between and coordinated
we must cuts and not unnecessary many money spend
briefly said is the just adopted resolution on hormonederegulating substances that the that there many to little know is on the harmful effects that the european parliament more research like and that there measures taken must to be the basis the the principle
although i for the resolution voted i like i here however a few comments the places
i am the with the rapporteur agree that the arguments in this discussion based must are the facts
i part however not are view that the measures a reflects must to are the the concern under the citizens
the ordinary citizens will usually not in the are a adequate risk to make
in the modern society with already are  as many equipment have we materials and substances need the very specific its have
all people or as you you almost all people accept and use this products
the substances and materials in this products to however the a risk with the that
as everyone can know is the whole life realignment with risks and uncertainties
the art the the life is to sensible with this risks and uncertainties to to to
still still is the science not far that a directly the between this chemical substances and changes in the human suspected clear and convincing is demonstrated
that the not way that i welcome am with the attention for this subject
the possible effects the this substances are not low
if the really as is that this chemical substances a increase the certain types cancer cause the death do fall or the unborn life threaten than must this what the done be
the human life is the worth to protected to be
from when this is the good that we clarity to on this substances
accordance the principle must the possible harmfulness the dangerous substances materials and products the a scientific basis to be for
the are both reduction if acceptance the a the risk the important
for the simply ban the substances to this each possible risk from to the feel i little
the risk is that there a witch opened will be the all substances without that this a scientific basis for is
also is the reversal the the proof not the are place
to the principle precisely to apply must we also to know what the harmful effects the any alternatives are
in general lines to the european members the the communist party the greece agreement with the elements the included must to be in the sixth programme for research all initial objectives of as the institution the committees the development the tests the improvement the the monitoring the  substances in the environment to the good on from
we want however the attention draw the the the the a general acceptable definition the the understanding hormonederegulating substances the must according us also the effects the nuclear radiation be included accidents waste the peaceful and military use the nuclear unrestricted and unconditional access the mitigated scientific committees to industrial use
we know example that by   can be caused the point we the the use the  in yugoslavia
also must a precise framework be the for research normal the tests and cooperation between the different scientific groups order credible results to can achieve
also must closer efforts be taken for precise research to the substances the that suspected be  to are perhaps is this a legislative framework for need
the information the the public opinion the consumers and the people the professional in contact to with substances the possibly  work farmers  and other workers must a the the objectives are information will the crucial important are for the success the the efforts
also must the precautionary the on the article p the the treaty control and withdrawal the wellknown and suspicious hormonederegulating substances and development the  alternative substances be applied
since there not few legislation on  there would there least a resolution on this complex issue adopted must be
in the framework the the principle is the the important that we least the  the the  the human and animal study and areas studies validate and the  the demonstrate between one certain products and hand certain existing derogations the human and animal reduced death  cancer etc in the text the moreover with not floor about on transparency
the decisionmakers in the private and public sectors will only action take if they to by the public opinion forced be
time when there new suspicious products be discovered must the list with products the probably  contain the the citizens and the in the health working people under the attention to be the
also must we the companies the suspicious products use the the standards to issues the also the medicines the application are this means that companies must can demonstrate that this products harmless are in the case that they by the european experts if suspected be regarded
there must therefore quickly binding measures to be proposed the basis which we this products the next years from circulation can to
the vote is closed
 in the internal market
the the item is the debate on the report a the mrs peijs behalf the economic and monetary commission on the communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament on  in the internal market com c cos
mrs the president in will any citizens in the euro the euro in hands have and certain benefits expect the are new currency
the benefits are there not as but
you must there something for do to they within to to
the communication the the commission on  like i in that light see
what must we with at all do to ensure to ensure that the european citizens the are own economy currency has given also indeed benefit has the are new currency
we must simple the transfers cheaper more and safer make
i expect than also without more the the commission that they the recommendations to changes the the directive the the i behalf the parliament in my report i plummet will into in a formal amendment the the directive
where is the to
core the the problem is that the send the small sums still still lead to large  the the central and small and the individual citizens
cause the high costs and the long time the agree involved is
conclusion the directive the has not enough effect had
we must further to
the consumer and the smes benefit not enough the the internal market the by the introduction the the euro is completed
a solution the this report by is that the infrastructure for this crossborder payment strong must be improve
the that that there the this at a number acts still conducting done the and that lead to high costs and long 
i call the banks than also the to the as briefly possible term all necessary measures to take so the processing the crossborder payments fully how and therefore many cheaper can has
in my report mention i under other systems as    and 
this systems can the payment between banks in different countries easier more and cheaper make the banks must than the with their clients communicate to their clear to make that addition the fixed  also their  future the their letterheaded the must be
this  can not without coordination
therefore have we a amendment tabled which the european central bank to the called this coordination very quickly the the to take basis the the by the treaty the the bank imposed responsibility for 
we questions the european central bank two affairs to regulate
in first body to a european  for transfers to develop
fact can that very quickly because that  is there already
this the replace the the national  that now already all used the
in second body to a european  to create example the 
a important point the is that such harmonised  by everyone in the euro used be
perhaps must we the consider to they compulsory the to to if the not quickly enough is
this put and  must according my report three months for the introduction the the away and notes ready are
that would a ideal situation are
the banks the however are that that impossible is
cure i i the this level a amendment for that says that the banks the january ready must are
as can the consumer the the at that he actually the euro in hands the immediately benefit the the change in the crossborder payment
the total costs the transfers to approximately the level the the cost for home payments can not only by going the the banks achieved be
they have the aid need the the member
because to now to are the banks by the member compulsory to crossborder payments over the euro to report the their central bank this with view the the 
this work is not to taken and the therefore conducting done
a very precious matter the with one market and one currency total unnecessary become is
in france the the also not the how francs there the paris to  to why would they
also forms volume and number the the  only a low percentage the the in total ceiling sums
your rapporteur is that convinced that there not objection not to there against abolition the the  to the the full amount the the directive namely euro
the loss the data for the  by this change is split
a this where change is that the money back  increased must be to euro
the this at be the banks almost rewarded if they your money favour
makes you euro on and the bank affects that money say than not the bank you but euro back to pay
banks must course at not money favour and they must offer are for their organisation
therefore to we for the limit the the money back  to increase to euro the amount the the directive
according the banks affects there never something say therefore that can never a point are
a last point is that i the consumers more opportunities like give to money on to make
the is the to consumers in need or a consumer without account
i question the european commission to into or companies if  and western union also under the second  would can the
this would this companies the free can draw in the whole european union also already are the not banks
course be the this companies same heavy demands the the the area the safety and laundering
i hope that this report the banks enough encourages to by to to the their  to a better effectively crossborder payment
but to the banks absolute security and clarity to give the their heavy investment expect i the the commission per  postal a amendment the the directive
mrs the president since the opening the the borders between the member the the european union make still more companies use the the possibility the this common market offers
the have we must the that the the one on the goods considerably easier were but that the the other on the the by way payments still still with very large obstacles and costs were linked
from the first study the the request the the economic and monetary commission on this subject is carried was that the crossborder transfers the more than dm the costs average total in some cases even
you must the proposals that of in first body the central and small the suffer is
the ambition the we if european parliamentarians the the opening the the markets between the member the the european union always have had was not to large companies access to to the they because long had but to this large european market to open for the central and small
therefore am i our rapporteur karla peijs extremely grateful for the am which they this objective already many years for view has namely to the costs the the payment between the member the the european union to reduce
i note that here already the a and another is happened that the costs the the transferring average considerably lower are than the the opening the the borders between the member just i i the that they still always many to high are and that here more must done
the banks say us time again and not at without reason that the necessary facilities to such transfers from to to the  the in each the the domestic individual there the european level still still not fully in item are made
here must still large efforts be done
i say this not only against the european central bank but also against the various  the there in the european union are
we to not to one system the transferring that would than again a monopoly are but we want the that there competition the between different systems the by different banks and  be up this competition will end a positive the have for the citizens and the central and small
mrs the president i welcome the report the the rapporteur the i to because the the problems the the crossborder payment to the brings
the the payment the per finally the account expect that the the economic integration in the european union strengthened and not  in the by is
that is the to now to still the because the many complaints from the central and small the any the citizens on the high costs for transferring the small sums are the the item the the day
the us are even cases know which the costs for transferring the the crossborder payment after the introduce the the euro are increased and the is the not to a small amount
the monthly cheque the daughter or son in a other member the the eu the crossborder transfers for make or services hotels or travel be additional responsible although the  more and leading would can be organised
there the even about the the possibility to costs with although the banks us there time again emphatically the point that the high yielding is in the treatment the the transferring and not in the technical process the the crossborder payment
however would the good are been if there same with the  for large payments also a  for small payments and  would are introduced because technical is that possible the there only the the like this the the was for the large payments
we meps have the also in the parliamentary commission the very regretted that the proposal the the european central bank not is approved
also here the we us the the the statements the the european central bank that the crossborder transfers within the eu the a day not more should are than the within a those
we insist already many years the the cooperation between the banks
the is finally already possible to a quickly safe and cheap system the to to and fortunately are the banks this now also that are they are the the good way
but the would good are been if we the period had can use
the many complaints the enraged citizens speak for the and i must say that precisely in this time the complaints course not positive are to the acceptance the the monetary union to increase
the political objective is clear and the supported by the european central bank we have a european area for payments need which everything just as good work if within a those
small clients are also a part the the internal market if large clients there must here not be against
i am however the opinion that also the governments still the a and another to do have and i support than also the report the the rapporteur
the  for  must immediately be abolished for crossborder small  the less than euro
testing are indeed sufficient
the european central bank can the help to know with the introduce the a european  in the payment and with support the the introduce the a european  within the international 
the important is that all involved bodies do what also the european central bank according the treaty must do namely the smoothly function the the  promote
the european commission has not the right to the informed the the bank the to to but they can the influence exercise the the reduction the the costs for transferring
there are costs in the union the really many the other from but partly are there also similar costs
this is a reduction the the free movement within the internal market
i think that the commission more than to now to last the results the the into must present namely or there  agreements between the banks there
important and that stressed the report rightly will the guidance the the consumer are the electronic payment we demands that there steps be taken to indeed also here a interoperable standard for several currency programmes for electronic  in to to
this is to now to in luxembourg france and germany possible but must extended and in all countries the the eu introduced be
i think that this report the large important is to the citizens and the central and small actually in the euro to into and the acceptance the the economic and monetary union to increase
we have safety speed and also low costs need
in the monetary union life like also say the a good effectively crossborder payment can count that is the motto for the remaining days
president i like i like with the the firm very the the rapporteur and its excellent report
i am also very pleased that the european commission with particularly commissioner bolkestein fact also commissioner monti the this matter a priority make
consumers and companies are in still greater extent dissatisfied on the level the the costs for crossborder  the the internal market very understandable is that
consumers pay many to many for what type the crossborder  than also and for cash  credit and naïve
for large sums is there a refined network which transfers just as quickly and just as cheap if home transactions be carried
however the private can still still not count the sufficient support and reduction the costs and efficient processing the the small sums
i like therefore again the emphasis to the the need the efficient safe and cheap services the the area the  the the internal market and also parallel with the introduction the the euro
the acceptance the the euro depends there also with particularly the the or consumers and companies in the are the euro if a internal  to use
that consumers the euro accept is crucial
the the at that the away and notes be introduced the january will consumers the currencies often to use and how is than for us from to to that there differences there in use also already i you one currency in one euro
the idea that transfers in two participatory  not longer given be if a international transaction where international costs that involved are but if a national transfer must all recognised to be
the the completion the the internal market are the high bank a obstacle
the consumer the impede to international to shop
he will example not a bill take the a foreign ambiguities if the international costs twice the price the the ambiguities sums because there such high bank that involved are
the free movement the capital with the common currency hear not obstacles or large differences to there
the objective must are one  retail space where the crossborder payments same conditions linked are and with same costs by to if apply for home transactions
that is in our view the any possible logical result the the internal market and one common currency
the free movement the people in the euro should a flexible market
if there still  there with the no must this not obstacle are to in the abroad to to work
the is a fact that banks in the whole euro the with the to the implementation for the directive the crossborder  very reluctant have up
after the implementation but also a large part the the problems unresolved
now the  still closer is is the really time for action both for banks if for member
banks must the to link the existing standards the  and  to implement
in this times the modern technology would the electronic motorway a way can offer
perhaps no what say i may the the time for a  the not costs composite
mrs the president in the welcome on the  in the internal market again the european parliament are old demand on the high costs the crossborder transfers within the union
the rapporteur refers the negotiated the are it
this costs are high and we know all why
the computer the the different banks in the member the not good the other the therefore are there precious mox acts need to money the the one national system to the other on to make
the is therefore not as that bankers unfair act the is here to a temporary technical problem that in the during the time themselves will be resolved
i think that we the problem must saying especially this crossborder transfers only a small percentage the all transfers represent
according the documents the i i consulted is the to or the all transfers
short the is to a very small percentage
however attach the european parliament and the commission there many gentlemen the
why fact
the european institutions do this in the first place because they inclined are their attention to up the crossborder activities this is quite for the hand
the must however not as are that by this attention for crossborder activities the interests the a small majority over the the the rest the the citizens placed be
if because that that the investment the outset are to the costs the crossborder transfers significantly to reduce not profitable are because they the a to small number those charged must be will they also be passed the the other clients the nothing with this problem to make have
i am the opinion that this not fair and therefore also not desirable is
from political view is this therefore very debatable we must not think that if a product to technical reasons many costs the suddenly free the available can be the because that in a directive decided is
late i you in remind to what we during our first  learnt have a free usage there not
the colleague the the european parliament has still a other reason mrs the president
in the welcome the this reason in recital d the the resolution mentioned the high level the the costs the crossborder transfers is harmful for the confidence the the consumer in the euro
i question i the or that the where is
the the first face the this two issues not the with other
in reality is the citizens few years ago told that this type costs with the arrival the the euro whole would disappear
there was from has that the citizens the euro as more would accept
i i a small publication consideration which there in france millions juveniles the public places with particularly in the post available were in the chapter incur the the  the money the that the costs for the  the money in the euro strictly taken will disappear
the unsuspecting reader the not good home is in the subject would inclined are to believe that all incur for crossborder transfers no in reality were this incur the the  the money but a very small percentage the the whole namely few 
now are we here with the consequences the the  the leinen is to the euro to sell this brings i the the conclusion on this issue on crossborder transfers what also if conclusion on the euro in the general as must be mrs the president
you can the reality with words deny and the citizens the everything delude
there is however a day that you the will must accountable for your vague statements and lies
mrs the president in the present report like you in almost almost any paragraph the strong nature that mr peijs which
rightly the the  sector tackled and solid  because while the most techniques and standards available are like the but not southern with the flexible the the crossborder payment for sums to euro
you would almost to think that not the the commercial banks there important the has the current way the work to modernise
i support the twintrack ways the rapporteur the slow banks to action like encourage
pressure through legislation only is i i not sufficient and would also the agree less effective can will than pressure through the over jobs give the competitive alternatives for the  the money within the euro
perhaps that the commission very seriously attention like to the this last possibility because the achieve the  the the way the an competition has because also its prefer take i the
one point think i what context
the demand to the tariffs for the  the money within the euro right to draw with the for banks within a member would there  the can europe that the tariffs for home banks to increase
certainly in netherlands where the years usual was that banks for home banks the consumers nothing in account rightfully
this objection the not way that i the rapporteur mr peijs all praise  for its leaf in this dossier
mrs the president commissioner bolkestein the before expert drawn report the mrs peijs is very important for the consumers in the euro and the confidence in the euro
here in the sitting are we rarely as united been on the important the a report
i join i the the the ensure the all colleagues the just have about and the what they have said
still never is the euro as little worth been if morning
the euro was when note the the relation the the american dollar
that is a new 
we have the that area therefore still many to do but this have politicians less resources to their available than for the  in the internal market
i like the commission thank for the fact that they legal steps has taken against  banks and  because possible agreements on the in account to the costs the the  the currencies
that is a very good action the the commission
the the other on i i also the a little understanding for the banks
although we in the european parliament now the banks criticise must the understand that crossborder payments only the the whole payment of the develop the this sector is for the banks therefore a expensive investment in compared with the to achieve benefit
from the view the the banks is that therefore a problem the the other on is the the cost the crossborder transfers the mox processing and this must the quickly the the see to to
as mrs randzioplath already said can we the banks not with political decisions prescriptive that they the costs reduce must to
what we can do is the european central bank force or under pressure to the banks directly to involve the a  which decisions be taken on the technical aspects which the costs reduce the can be
we can banks not force  affairs to do but if politicians can we the behalf the group by the mr radwan and mrs peijs tabled amendment support the the called still for end next year measures to take and the as also already on standards to have if the away and notes in use be taken
mrs the president i think the very unfortunately that in this parliament where the the members their political reputation have used the the euro there not more members present are the the discussion on the the and woe the this currency
we know that the send the money the the one to the other country the the euro time as duration is if the send within a and same country
the people thought that with accession to the euro the least cheaper and easier would be to money that to take to the abroad
we see however that this not the case is
the promised benefits are not hard made as the commission naïve ie during the treatment the this report in the commission will the situation also after the introduction the notes and currencies not improve
this is the another blow for a  currency a currency the almost any week a new reached achieved the the international market a currency which the conservatism constantly under great the taken because are wrong   a currency also which during the only opportunity the danish referendum the europeans all had to the from to speak for or against accession to the currency no was voted
we hear now that the  the the notes must make risk in strike to to
the most is however that the the benefit that the  the people in europe have promised to know reduction the  not hard made the
what benefit have the people in the euro now the this currency the their by a political elite in europe is imposed
the this project is the not to economy
the this project is the not to the give the practical benefits the the european citizens
this was and is a step in the direction the the united states the europe in the direction the a political project
we see that this project not the ability is the majority majority the ordinary people in the euro benefits to offer
mrs the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes to to start would i mrs karla peijs the i want thank for its report and its perseverance to successes for the citizens to achieve
the the the euro also for the citizens reality he has the euro than because in are own anatomy
the costs for a crossborder transferring the euro within the market sums average euro a need the the costs for national transactions
the  will also in the future if a internal market be given and the citizens understand not that in this area which there not risk programmes more are and electronic payment with  still  be a transferring the munich to kitzsteinhorn considerably more is than a transferring the munich to 
the benefits the the euro must clear be made the the citizens also the the central and small especially because we currently problems have with the acceptance the the euro and many the feeling have that large companies and banks that benefit but the normal citizens not
for i counts also the argument not that there now but very little crossborder payments in euro programmes in the internal  be done
that is the  story
we see the if members in brussels because itself but also our staff that we because the high  not crossborder payments do
i am there the the convinced that this if the costs fall with or will increase and the people the this possibility use will make
i welcome the to that the commission pressure the the banks remains exercise and this ilisu still will up with its procedure against banks
also the european central bank would more pressure must exercise
the proposal the mr peijs and i the also the banks the the table to to not to provisions the to to but because we from the political not more pressure can exercise
we want not handling the this area but we must this the least coordinate
the european central bank is very suitable to the introduction the european  and  to promote
i hope also that the low prices not suddenly only on five year to but gradually and that the first progress already visible are in
end will we us objective have achieved if the banks the the consumer advertising make with low bank for crossborder payments
than have we a real market the this area
mrs the president i will english speak to mrs villiers a answer to give they spoke on the benefits and the possible disadvantages the the euro
although this a many discussed subject is in this days is this not under my competence
i will its comments pass the my mr the mr solbes complied the the concerns with macroeconomic issues
i feel not need something the this debate to to add
i like the affairs not clearly
mrs the president i would like want start with mrs peijs the i to thank for its excellent report on the creating the a single uniform area for payments
after the completion the the internal market and the introduction the the currency have we now more than ever need the a single area for payments
in the future should borders not role more play
the term must there even in the whole not difference more there between a crossborder and a home payment
the achieve the this objective will us and also you still many years work costs
in this the would i your attention want draw the the date january
the date must if a extremely important and symbolic milestone be as in the construction the the european union say i now also the the to the mrs villiers
the the deliberate date january will all citizens the the euro because same coins and notes in their anatomy have
after the european passport is this the second tangible and in the life the called  proof that we all to the european union properly
we must there therefore everything the do to the new stage to do succeed
because if the systems for the out the crossborder payments just duration continue if today is the credibility the the new system the coins and notes the the again to are
therefore is the the the essential important that over for january a whole series measures the taken so this the force are when the new coins and notes their advent do
the commission will all in the report made proposals under the look take
we will especially the problems the the area the the competition closely study
to this regard would i in answer the comments the mrs kauppi and also the mrs randzioplath the unfortunately the sitting has must leave want say that the commission into has done to possible agreements between banks
that research has place in february
the commission has statements the objection sent to banks in six member
that is happened in july the this year and the member are portugal ireland belgium finland netherlands and the federal germany the procedures the the associated are now the the the
that research to the costs the the crossborder payments in account be the is now way
more in the general is the commission the believe that the technological development the possible makes the competition the this area the the payment to up because competition lead course to lower costs
we will on that subject the mind exchange during a large roundtable the the november next in brussels will place
in the summer the will the commission also with a report to on the improvement the the crossborder payment
in that report say i now very directly against mrs peijs will legislative be done to amendment the the directive from the last year the force is become
i say that very directly the the to the mrs peijs because i know that they price the the a clear answer the this point
i say its therefore to that the commission after that report is produced and that is not per  postal as mrs peijs has asked but in any case however reasonable quickly will to with legislative topic
the the opportunity will we the also have on reduction the the term for the implementation the crossborder transfers which in the report the mrs peijs the the
the this at already find in the the cases transfers the money place within three days
the is there course to the to increase to
this trying the commission influence from to exercise the banks
again that will still only time the the let wait but the proposal the mrs peijs to the period back to to to the half will the commission therefore next summer a judgement do
they will try to the the fails the your sitting meet to to
in the report the the rapporteur the also the emphasis the the the statistical verdicts the banks the any crossborder transferring must do
the verdicts are compulsory the by the member and not by the commission
we are the believe that this form the  the statistical data on the internal payment the the union a vestige is from the past that in a integrated single area not more to justify is and that a obstacle is for the good force the the market
i hope than also that the member quickly on will to to a update the their systems for the  the statistical data
the commission the also fully behind the proposals the the european parliament to the electronic pay the to encourage
important in this the is however that the technical and legal safety guaranteed is especially what the the supposedly directly 
the commission is the other not agree with the report the the commission legal affairs and internal market because this commission request us because a initiative to take to the costs for crossborder payments right to decided with the costs for home payments
with the principle of can we us course agreement explain but not with the proposed method
we are as know favour the free competition but not the administrative handling
also as very rightly said by the mr blokland would a such measure immediately a does effect can have because the costs the home payments would directly be increased
i think not that consumers the never crossborder transfers out that the price would to
the am i has the the end the my short speech on the result that the commission intends is to give the the report the mrs peijs
i hope that the the call the you with particularly to the  you at respond will be given
the commission and the european central bank to a permanent and often difficult dialogue with the banking to to tangible results to to and your support is the the i welcome
president the reassurance the the commissioner the report the the legal commission is therefore not included if document in the report the the investments
the parliament in are wisdom is the whole with you agree
president i am mrs peijs grateful for the last comment the the if such also by the commission accepted therefore what that the continue we the the the that the commission the agree is in all respects even with the report the mrs peijs
the debate is closed
the vote take today to at place
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
multiannual for companies and entrepreneurship
the the item is the debate on the report a the mrs montfort behalf the commission industry external trade research and energy on the proposal for a decision the the council on a multiannual for companies and entrepreneurship com c cns
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues everyone know they the the time repeated disappointment itself you you not can protect but which you the time to time you indignation must express to the to give that you you there not the up and that inability not always by is with indifference
survivors the the speeches the a number mr programmes in the commission the longer member are the this parliament than i me i the impression that the multiannual for companies and entrepreneurship which the parliament the for the fourth time going to this category one
i me often to hear that all good intentions welcome are but let we there now agree for ensure that in the next report on this subject not again again same observations must be done if in the previous reports the situation regarding the european companies will because not actually change
in the text the you today is presented be the promising way the different opportunities investigated and old interest scrapped left the european union can the this research a important role play if they least its place and role in this framework know
there are because still but little unilateral fighters the the still always the wrongly in terms the horrific on the business express also know everyone that now the the beginning the the third millennium the unemployment and the lack the social cohesion the most problems the our society are and that the company a central place its the the solve the this issue
the seems i not unnecessary here in remind to to that the business the both economic if social level a unparalleled place its
the is because the most driving behind the employment and the social integration also is the in the during the time a very important role to play the the regular education for young the permanent education and the planning planning
the business is because the very effective way with this planning planning to
given the important the the business have the fifteen member during the summit the feira the june on the charter for small companies approved thanks this charter can there now considerable progress be made
the charter is now the basis for a ecommerce that actually in service the the companies itself the although we us not only to the small companies must up has this charter if particularly large benefit that the this small companies a central place 
we must the us act in first body from to to the this small companies the parliament that there from members the regular the country withdraw must the for this charter from to speak
the smes must not as be if a multinationals company in the small we can because not from the problems the a small company how what the problems the large companies are
we must however the pragmatic to work to and the situation the close follow therefore must we the small central to to and not from to to the a proposal the basis which we although the right statistics can made but not specific use the this statistics can make also already use some if excuse that fragmentation the this way prevent can be
the does i therefore pleased that the commission industry external trade research and energy the unanimously has expressed for a sectoral approach the this issue a such approach must because followed to be to the real and specific needs the the companies as precise possible in card to to
since there large differences between companies there is a horizontal approach inadequate
course is the a good matter to the performance the companies between to compare and the best practices from to exchange but this methods enough not to the serve and allow within the companies the positive way to influence
what must there than done be late i first three simple ideas have
in first body must we use make the the existing networks to knowledge the to do which we a ecommerce can develop and the effective way can out this seems i better than a situation which the majority the the companies the the formulate the such policy outside one the left
to the reason the in the report stressed that the sector and professional closely the this issue involved must be this organisations can us because many learn and can us help prevent that we by our ignorance a good idea in a wrong decision into
in second body must we that ensure that the access to the  with particularly for the smallest companies not further the difficult
a good access to  is because the crucial important for the initiate develop  transfer and even the survive the the company we make us in this respect ensure on a number decisions that recently taken is or soon taken will be
i think the the the foreign  the both the european investment if the european fund or the the proposal for a directive on the own resources the banks that hope not adverse effects will have the the extent which companies in the are appropriations to obtain
now the economy more than ever based is the knowledge and technological innovation is the the large important that the commission that ensure that there fully opportunities continue there and be created for the most courageous and innovative entrepreneurs the prepared are risks to take they must their spirit because in specific action can into
since spirit not from can be given the the understanding responsibility must clear be the what the european added the the area the the ecommerce can are
the the political direction the followed must be must the member the their responsibilities out to be
the council has this direction in feira ones with the charter for small companies
we must our efforts up the the coordination the the policy that in this framework is the and by the member the implement is the to must all technical and administrative obstacles be these the the good function the our companies unnecessary assignments
the this way can the charter a particularly give the have
i hope than also that the european parliament the just if the commission industry external trade research and energy unanimously will express for this programme and as a clear and strong signal will give the the business that we as hard need have
gentlemen colleagues i like you the advance thank for your support the my report
mr the commissioner i know that i the your energy and determination can count the the implementation the this programme
we must this programme in the to with the other community programmes and annual the balance made so the if can be adapted
the this way can we together the head offer the the issues the the full employment and the social cohesion
behalf all companies but also behalf our societies like i you you thank
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes to to start would i mrs montfort want congratulate with its report and also want thank for the excellent and  cooperation
europe has itself to objective the to in economic respect no to be and this can the multiannual contribute
but the is the this area especially the important that the the areas in the society encourages that young there more on to give to for itself to start or in small companies to to work
and that means that we mainly active must be within the education
to for briefly thought many young people agreed to after their study or training official to be or for large companies to to work the terms structure very the a the seem
the must we a turning through
but this turning is also already see many easy companies be up by young people and we must this areas encourage
i i three specific comments on this programme
the first the commission is intends to a policy to promote and from to devise that positive is for companies
to like the a comparative assessment the performance benchmarking introduce what certainly a interesting point is
we must there however absolutely the ensure that this point also achieved is be
currently is the the intention that this assessment process between the eu and the member but that will not precisely picture give
if i look to germany the country where i from come the a uniform statistics not the situation in the region programmes again
as are there example between bavaria and  properly large differences
or compare we the conurbation london with scotland
there would more distinction must be made to a better picture to to the political the positive is for companies
the second the commission think agreed after to the central and small what less to support
that is also a point which can be discussed
the support the the central and small would namely against the effectiveness that must be produce and the follows already the question continue in what that the european level in this form possible is
if the the however the european level  must the the region programmes again more opportunities give in this the must in each case the  regulation agree be examined
also must the block exemption the subsidies for the central and small the a revision be subject
the third traditional companies and 
we make always a distinction between new and old economy
the i in bavaria is there a company a joiner the the are turnover meantime through the internet they
is that old or new economy
i think that we this two areas must infamous so also the normal traditional economic sector to the new economy is properly
i i topic two ask the the commissioner the first is that the commission the ensure can working that there software the developed the really appropriate is the the central and small and the terms extent and costs in the central and small application will find
the second is that the dg companies that a merger is the the directoratesgeneral for the central and small and industry in increasing extent  programmes karamanou and also a  has in the whole commission on  this directorategeneral must all legislative decisions and communications the the commission control the  programmes
finally hope i that the  programmes the the commission the the central and small will to offer as be explained that the the from the perspective the the customers look that the therefore for the central and small still understandable is
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes if  since eleven year know i if not another that debates on the central and small in us parliament or new or suit are
according the criteria the the european union one more than the the companies to the smes
this is not very seriously to take and membership the obscurity the there in europe the regard the this understanding there the declared also the many uncertainties
to just your memory the to  the first community action the this area was in adopted seventeen year ago therefore
our rapporteur mrs montfort has the last weeks in close cooperation with already its mr programmes very good and sound work done
they has in the text the the commission the lack effectively as the important differences between statements and the reality
its work that we monitored have presented to more clarity to provide and a clearer classification the to to in the different forms the smes  and small companies
the is fact with same intention that we and also myself a number specific and strong proposals have tabled to the regard the the smes words to to to in action by small and mediumsized companies access to to to innovative technologies and the electronic trade by certain customs to simplify by certain administrative and regulatory inequalities from to racial by and this is very important the access to capital to facilitate by  the to up order the information and support the companies to improve by the framework research and development more to oversee the the innovative 
personally i i together with my mr programmes the emphasis the the the small companies and the 
i i favour for compliance the the objectives on the environment and sustainable development and for the simplify the the access to new information and technologies for the smes
i i also asked to activities to encourage the at are the specific groups as women young and sectors the the social economy without the  the the performance the this companies from the view to lose
the smes plays a crucial role the the social cohesion and the planning planning because the the most source the employment is both quality if terms
therefore is the more than urgent to the many obstacles from the way to overcome the are development among and where need training the to offer
i hope therefore mrs the rapporteur that your report unanimously will be adopted and the this area last will lead to a qualitative leap forward and that certain already to liberal amendments rejected will be as the reduce the the number  programmes and the up the a new centre
to my speech in a few words together to summarise mr the president would i want say and that say i the personal title not words but action
president mr the commissioner colleagues must i first and especially also a  express the the rapporteur the indeed with large care its report has developed
the care is more than necessary want we against the company europe indeed to the to and want we the the european union the most competitive and dynamic economy the world make
by the amendments the the report in the commission under other the my proposal was stressed that the multiannual applied must to be if instrument to economic growth full employment and social cohesion to promote
the is a important emphasis like i emphasise that in the information and the information greater must to be expressed because there can not enough be stressed that entrepreneurship and business both the an large important are and that therefore also in the particularly attention must be spent and granted the the training the young but also the the for in permanent training the the staff in small and mediumsized companies
especially like i there today for favour as many possible if all obstacles for the achieve the the internal market systematically to let disappear to the competitiveness the the small and mediumsized companies to optimise so they the the a dynamic and sustainable way further can develop
also am i there still favour the been that the this the a efficient and pragmatic policy would torn
i am pleased with the  the mr caudron the says let we less the ideology do but more the a efficient and pragmatic policy what content that all administrative directed limited must to be to a absolutely minimum
and the must that based to be that in our union in first body the customs simplified be because the difference in costs between the member the tax social administrative and  level is because a fundamental brakes the the equal access to the internal market
to finally mr the president would i there also for want favour that account the taken with the  enlargement the the european union
the effective implementation the the acquis is necessary to ensure to ensure that the enlargement a  situation the both for the member if for the countries
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes also i like like our mr mrs elisabeth montfort congratulate with the quality the its report on the multiannual for companies and entrepreneurship for the period
the concern which they the proposals has examined and the consultation that they has held with many involved parties are extremely valuable has to this programme better to define and the implementation that to improve
i would here like a number concerns want emphasise the us are the if we the european contribution the the business in this new socalled economy want improve
what can we still more contribute the the company europe as president prodi the recently mentioned in a the are speeches
the the first place must in this the any company examined be
course are there the large companies let we say companies the few thousands people in service have
for this companies must we not only look what their contribution is the the area the the market employment and the achieved profits but also what contribution they make the knowledge by their support the new research programmes the  and 
thanks the contacts the this companies maintain with often public dorado can the often  aid be supplemented and inventions be done
we must therefore vigilant are the our positive action the this level
let we the on the  and  have
this represent as the mr caudron already said the our economy
they have the the 
the are fact were economic  the first are and therefore in high extent exposed are the the dangers inherent the this area
we must their interests who and specific measures take the they easy can frame in their governing
the the second place will i not back the the measures the in the report be proposed the fact the result are the a last year made assessment you can nevertheless see that the often old issue programmes are the return simplification the  the still still to been and i i even choked are for the smes support for funding and capital order more stability to achieve support the the research to new technologies introduction the a european exchange by the 
 this companies must can benefit the a positive  or geographical or technological the nature
we must their activities and also the local development with through the local material and human resources encourage and their relations with local authorities improve
we must not only the traditional companies help but also the joint companies and companies with rollcall liability the the still more up the the create the a better stability and the create the new jobs
the the third place must we the european added gentlemen achieve
the is with particularly to think the the implementation the a european network both physical if electronic which any  the can with information can obtain knowledge from can exchange with respect the appropriate methods and ethical standards and as optimum use can make the the opportunities the the european union them offers
the seems i course that the not to can are that everything the this area from brussels the run
we must decentralised actions further with delegations the the commission the parliament or the council the regional level can control as was the recently also in the  proposed
there would also certain  programmes elected must be
this are easy to find with particularly in the society in the sustainable development which so about the and the the area the environment clean technologies  new forms the energy and new materials
this european network would a number centres must for the a label as the 
a  that together with a such european network the logos if there there is the synergy is not longer compulsory a consortium with several companies the different countries within the union to forms what often led to artificial theory and heavy complex dossiers
i would very like see that the commission the this point a group would forms the is up from motivated parliamentarians
the the fourth place like i again the attention draw the the proposals on the european research the we recently have launched
also to we for to a european  to build and i am mrs the rapporteur very grateful that they this proposal in its report has want into
to finally must we us the on the results the the represents science and administration that previous week taken is in brussels under auspices the the centre for future technology to seville we must the the results the this conference system because there there many agreements with the subject that we today deal
the finally am i that convinced that the at time is to us to those in our choices and in the control the our actions to within the european parliament a real parliamentary body to create the the scientific and technological choices what if counterpart the the provision bodies the the national parliaments
our president mrs fontaine asking us today if responsible the the  a support the the to the the  to up the  is a specialised organisation for technological assessment in europe the is up under auspices the our mr the mr barón barón and the the november next in berlin unequivocally
but the  is not really the competent body and we have precise proposals on this subject
mrs montfort our group will your report massive support
mr the president mr the commissioner each small and mediumsized company both in the sector if service sector can only the the market survive if the full  has
full  has the only if there ways are and the can roughly in three categories be into the first the large companies the second private and the third the authorities
from that that the only good is with the central and small if the asylum low is and the national budgets the all levels  are and on sufficient money have for investment
i would like the the smes in the particularly the attention want draw the the  the here course with still  and  circumstances to make have especially in the sector
this companies have but rarely on own research and potential so the risk the them particularly large is that they the following miss with innovation and development that they antiquated technologies use and the not adapt the the increasing substandard
the is the often for that  the here enough present are not be use because the management not enough qualified is
still at apart the the our the to the date not are resolved permanent not capital a very bad access to appropriations by the lack the the banks usual certainties regional  markets and dubious debtors
that means that there a targeted policy for the central and small need is that one the  programmes  and hand also account the with are specific interests and areas with the to size globalising  etc
the report the mrs montfort is a considerable improvement the the report the the commission
you would almost think mrs montfort that you itself a committed  you the a mediumsized company
your report is excellent
despite had i hoped that the least two economic trends still more to the were has
namely the first a strengthening i say not a summer but a strengthening the the  in relationship to the  economic policy
the second within the encourage the investment a shift the the importance to  and something less to 
because versa means this that the taxpayers money the available the and the companies this apply use to their company to rationalise
then to they their workers the streets and say they against the taxpayers that he but must every what there with this free become workforce happening
that can however not in the important are the the economy
that must perhaps from training view to reasons the  normally acceptable seem but not from the view the the 
i think that we if european parliament responsible are for a good  and that this priority has the our responsibility for the 
president this multiannual offers a european framework for the development the the  and the competitiveness the the business in the member
the receive the principle the the subsidiarity the attention the the us i deserves
we vote in with the attention the the rapporteur mrs montfort rightly paying the the central small and  and the the to the priority support the young easy entrepreneurs
the rapporteur lists a number reiterate for strengthening the the european  the
as organisation they for the following the the companies the the new information and technologies
the question rice than the how the multiannual in be specific contributes the strengthen the the competitiveness the the companies
how this also they for the commission is a stimulating role play for the exchange the regional experience and best practices the this area
a another at the mrs montfort is the improvement am the simplification the the law and legislation in the member
for the down the unnecessary administrative barriers for the business are we any always to find
a third point the concern consider we mr the president the protection the intellectual rights the european level
we objectives than with particularly the the public the 
companies have need the clarity
otherwise formulated has the still sense in this sector to invest
in this the urges the also the question the or europe possible lagging the the usa precisely because the lack the the european embryos the software
the finally mr the president will the practice the national and regional level thousand are for the success the the before multiannual
the that level hear according our political vision the  to are
european further for such areas is always welcome
mr the president gentlemen ladies and gentlemen i am itself reared and working been in a 
i know with what problems a small company to make has
therefore like i the mr liikanen congratulate because today is there something managed what the large important is for a small company and for the many firm the there within the eu are
the  the the last mile offers new opportunities for the competition and good opportunities for new companies to the the this area to proof if we see that the programme dm
million euro the available the and if we that parts by the million small and mediumsized companies the the european union than to we from the euro per year per company
precisely therefore is the programme as important because the impetus principle and the right impetus what also for us if members very important is
example with the 
my  is the mr  and if i a problem i the the area the support a problem with european institutions than can i against my entrepreneurs say this is someone the competence is and there everything the the know the within the even times information can give on public tender  programmes research or infrastructure
that is excellent for europe because there correctly competence and quickly can be help
precisely for small companies is the the large important that there quickly the help
for a small company is three or six months wait the information or a programme endlessly long
that like say how smaller the company how more processes has and by the new technologies has processes course still more
everyone know that our time by the use the mobile telephone email and internet  is become and that offers course fully new opportunities
therefore is the important that we there also the the financing the ensure that this companies access to the capital to not only the the stock
especially when a  or a company with less than workers a project has must the not only with  guarantees with guarantee possible are the would also possible must are to with a good idea financed to be
unfortunately are we in europe still far the the such views
what we need have are more specialists the our companies the difficult processes the european level help
if example like i the standards take
a small company know in principle not many on how a standard the and how the a standard the european level effect
therefore are groups if  very important because this also a small company quickly and efficient knowhow can to of unreasonably the internet or because the simply help the the daily work
a the the most points is however the 
if we see that the tax in the united states average is and the us means this that small companies the us simply productive must are to same to deserve or longer must work
we would there than also to must to to with  laws with slim exchange and best practices the  so possible to reduce to a simple and good economic framework for our companies to create
mr the president also i like like mrs montfort thank for its excellent work
i think that the debate within the commission industry extremely useful is been and necessary to in this multiannual which we will vote again the appropriate area and attention to pay the the central and small and especially the the  the small sector as important for the economy the the european union i hope that the parliament for the report will vote
the programme the the commission paying unfortunately but little area and attention the with particularly the  while the concept the the  and the small company the last years as in the interest has been we must however the interests the small and  better defend and especially specific are when we the have on knowledge and economy and on research and renewal
from that view is this multiannual only a first step were we specific measures must take i part the this point the opinion the the mr rübig
we must example the network the the euro euroinfopoints think support this forms a the the most  for the central and small the the european union
the them would also a coordination role the local level the the already existing european networks must be entrusted
also would in all programme programmes the the european union the the area the research renewal the project eeurope etc fixed quotas must be allocated the the small and 
mr the president this report is a  the the areas but behind the lyrical words to subsidies and support by the european institutions find because forget not that areas there the the clemency the words the money in the have to
the explanatory has the on smes programmes and stressed that the the can to to companies with maximum workers and to sector the only two or three people in service have and that this companies in total more than the all companies within the union would of
but how the this small and mediumsized companies are in fact  the large groups
and how are the subsidies divided on this groups and the small companies
this the with not floor on reference in the report because that would characteristics the the recognition that the mention the the small companies in fact only the demagogic justify is the the support the the given the the large companies
national authorities and even the regional or local bodies must already if huge providing the money the the taxpayers cannot money that paid the by the majority the the population including the poor and to the large companies and end to their owners and their shareholders is
the perspective the the european institutions limited the to the further promote the scandalous transactions while there even within the union however the rich part the the european continent decades millions people in poverty life
with your if mr the president like i like answers the mrs montfort that the the large employers are the any day the horrific with the workers into and that the precisely the minority is which they refers the the interests the the  defends
mr the president i must first express make that i a important i
i am able the  the a very small company a  in london
i will not say where this company the that concerns because that would advertising can are but the was up by my father francis chichester and i am there very proud the
thanks this company can i here to to to to for my electorate to work
i am welcome with any measure as this proposal and this report which we demonstrated can give the our support the european support the the smes and with particularly the small companies
i thank therefore mrs montfort for already the work that they for its report has done as we have heard enjoys this report broad support in all areas the this parliament
the best that we i i can do for small companies is they with upon let and not to try only the the harmony horse to if
the best way to forward to to is to ensure for diversity and sound figures than will themselves will who the most is
i know still what the commission a year ago against us said on the experience in the united states this governmentrun they not back for a failure and believe they in the saying the  gaining
the most is the right balance to find and to prevent that people the failure others in their fall persuaded
i fear that the real obstacles and faceless for small companies elsewhere are the in the european and national legislation the enormous administrative tax and regulatory burden with the that brings
for small companies are the burden disproportionate been sometimes even intolerable
i i recently a look minds the the  the small companies in the uk must fulfil and the i i noticed that you extremely must careful to not the wrong answer to give the already the details
to finally like i still clear make that according i for small companies competition the best medicine is competition is the most
competition the ensure that this small companies efficient innovative and profitable be
mr the president we must here especially point the the priority the with the new multiannual for companies and entrepreneurship the given the the central and small
i i experience gained in a  the make publishes and this experience vote i little optimistic i know the large sometimes impossible problems which the central and small is faced precisely because are low size
with the multiannual the i i only the problem recognised this the although a important and encouraging political signal given but not real aid is what under more by lack the resources also not possible is i like than still not agree speak on a possible change the trend in the current economy now the everything what small is in what sector than also simply under the footing got
the central and small is as general the admitted a users the new talents and innovative ideas this be new products and services switches and can independent minds their creativity the free during let
how small and mediumsized companies are however in the this precious elements costly not only for the economy and the society but for very the european civilisation to to to in real company
only a few
in the phased the the central and small  thousands been transplanted the then the large companies with human and ideas feed
the small and mediumsized companies must the head offer the a their competition and even if they the head over water can the terms production thanks new original and imaginative proposals  they often on other problems as distribution marketing and advertising for their products
distribution is a extremely complex and expensive matter become this has the large quantities products and a good organisation for need what often too is asked the the central and small
advertising is any usually outside scenario because that many to duration is
the phenomenon the  is the last years strong has in many sectors the be already this efforts the the central and small literally creaming and the there a brakes the the the creativity
mr the president mr the commissioner i voice fully in with this document and i am satisfied that mrs montfort the central and small in europe under our attention has the
i question i even the how long we will must wait before the european union responsible is to the standards to change the the central and small in europe regulate and especially when the climate will change that in  year the left governments or mainly left governments the spirit the the european companies has damaged
in many the our countries the someone the for itself start as if a criminal or if a  a  or a  in place the if someone the the least a work creates the the itself
new companies would for least five year must be from the taxes and taxation and a person the a own company start would by a perceived older monitored must be
what pensions and social security the the aspect that i the best know would a independent the least so must to if a worker in bringing
in many the our fifteen member are the pension the insurance and the insurance against accidents the selfemployed less good regulated than the workers in the private sector
that is not fair and therefore support i this report
mr the president according i has mrs montfort with its report the original document the the commission considerably strengthened
i am a constructive  the certain efforts the the mr liikanen
i i was the first document not sufficient much but mrs montfort has with its valuable report the our which the central and small to camps has in the central placed
i like here with particularly point the the new approach in the commission industry external trade research and energy the a hearing has taken on the in the report the mrs montfort express issues
how more people from the central and small the us in the european parliament on the without to to with us to talk on their problems more to better we us work can do
this is a the the things the the industry from now regular must organise
in my final in this debate like i briefly back the the goes
the problem with the central and small is that they not sufficient resources have to information the outside to seek to from to find what support and aid available is to the administrative tasks to role the they in still greater extent imposed to by the national governments
we must therefore give on the way which we information for them accessible can make
us are many measures proposed but i request the commissioner the with particularly to to on the the way which support and information easy and quickly available can be made so the people the this companies manage the information also actually can use
i know that there many  available are in the european union
there the although becoming the the aid the the smes as the mr caudron a  in this problem already said but if like the like is are very what companies not in the benefit to draw the the is aid
we have good concerted specific and effective measures need if we this programme the results want let positive the the must positive
fr mr the president i like the the first place the rapporteur mrs montfort and the commission the the european parliament thank for the work that they with this proposal for a decision have done
i thank you also for the support the you has given the the proposal the the commission
the multiannual for companies and entrepreneurship will a important instrument forms the support the the european companies
the programme address the especially the the central and small
the are the small companies the the most to suffering have under the obstacles the the 
they be fully the links the by administrative procedures
therefore must we in the first place small think  uncontested secretary
that is also the principle the the charter for the small companies
we are positive the the amendment with the to the charter
many amendments have the the  and small companies
we are grateful for the support the they the this way to
they must in look be taken the the implementation the the programme but there is not reason to they separately to mention in the text
to the objectives the the summit the lisbon on entrepreneurship and the transition to a society for everyone to achieve are there dynamic and competitive companies need
they are the only the more and better work can provide
only with competitive companies can there a end made be the social exclusion
we have entrepreneurs need from all sections the our society
more women entrepreneurs more young and more entrepreneurs from areas the the society the not the input have where they right the have
already this people will priority to in the multiannual
companies in development have a adapted funding need the with the any stage the their lifecycle
the market contains however many delays the loophole must be with particularly in the initially
enlargement and sustainability properly to the priorities the the majority the us work
the parliamentarians have agreed with this principles
also we are convinced the their important
we see many would a small number effective projects than a fragmentation the activities
i would you grateful are to this approach to support
thanks our procedure best can the commission the best practices determine and the implement to
we will the results broad communicate and the parliament the the informed the
also must we precise determine what extent the european administration the best with the a the initiative
we have not the intention to our like the to to the activities the better the national level carried can be
but we welcome for far need contribute the the member the us to support can are and information provide on our companies to the the conditions for admission to the european market to determine
in the programme be the networks responsible for the provide the this information
the already our efforts have we the opinions need the the business and the other groups
we are are our  to improve so we the any at in contact can act with this parties
mr the president the european companies have a good  need to the to develop
the multiannual will try the president  the small and mediumsized companies to improve
i like you questions us the this intention to support
to finally i i positive the the idea to one time per year meet to to to the progress the the programme to look
what the form the this assessment the i i all for open
let we here together on give
you thank mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take today to at place
action for albania and the every region
the the item is the debate on the report a the mrs karamanou behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the action for albania and the every region c cos
mr the president in the conclusions the the european council the tampere the out the the need the cooperation with the countries the origin and transit the immigrants and refugees therefore responsible the council the group the high level for asylum and  with the the the six plans a of the albania and the many area
the objective the the action is doubt the emigration to the countries the the european union to restrain and the return the illegal in the union resident albanians possible to make
therefore there this action mainly from measures for monitoring and prevent the flows
cooperation with third countries can doubt to contribute that the causes the the immigrants and refugees be these that means however not that the union the redundancies the its international obligations in the with the protection the robbing
they must the certainly aid to and contribute the the fight the the causes the emigration the europeans would last must recognise that how more the drop between the countries the the union and their neighbours the how greater also the  the
we can those the a gradually the our prosperity claim not the way  by our borders the to scenes or repressive harmonize to take
if we europe change in a  will the tariffs the those the the immigrants illegal the union  perhaps being to but illegal entry will only really can be fight if a legal way to immigration the is therefore must we albania the any possible way help in the fight the poverty the improvement the the living the achieve the employment the strengthen the the democratic institutions and the respect the the human and the with particularly the rights the minorities women and children
from the recent violence against the greek community in himara is has how necessary democratisation strengthening the the institutions and respect the the human in albania is us objective must are the economic growth and the social development to up
also must we ensure for cooperation and peaceful society with the neighbouring only the the way can the vicious circle the poverty and violence which immigrants and refugees the be broken
the group the high level has elected for a  that does however not with the diverse look the the work the the group the high level would must characteristics
that does nor with the conclusions the tampere which the made the full respect the the asylum the on the the treaty the geneva albania has very little experience with  and still not the necessary mechanisms the established the for research the asylum
therefore can albania still not if a safe country for refugees be as nor is albania in economic political and social respect in the such tasks the the to take as also the high commissioner the the un for refugees has the
the the problem the course the with the fact that the albanian political system very fragile is the parliament only a weak role plays the legal system and the justice in bad the situation and the administration and the planning by the authorities many to wish house
in many areas the the country there insecurity and anniversary the crime and with particularly the drugs and arms crime therefore will the cooperation with the albanian government for the application the the in the draft proposed measures probably not the a hipc hipc are
course be efforts taken to the situation to improve as however from the recent elections is has has the in albania after the years express the the country still not democratic culture can develop
in my report be already this factors in recital taken and end few measures proposed as must the in the action proposed measures gradually the the implement be the
the will a study must make the the needs as in the first part shortcomings the that what the most wrongdoings problems are
the must in albania example first the economy and the democratic institutions to development to and a infrastructure up only then must we if union agreements for the return the refugees and immigrants sign
i like here with particularly also point the the need the measures for the improvement the the home safety and the strengthen the the dialogue between the europeans and the local authorities in albania the council and the commission must to finally in cooperation with the albanian italian and greek authorities specific activities develop
apart of is coordinated action requires with a as large possible participation the europol to a end to make the the trafficking and the prostitution the women and children and the the activities the the criminal all the people smuggling and them exploit by they black to let work and to prostitution to force
i like to finally my support express the the preparatory work for the closure the a agreement on stability and partnership between the union and albania
mr the president best mr programmes to to start must i however my surprising express on the fact that the commission has allowed that a group the the council the high level work done that they fact after amsterdam had must do
i think that unfortunately although what the group has done not wrong is because he the finger exactly the the nail place the and also trying the right solutions to give
as mrs karamanou already said is albania since the opening the are iron curtain that particularly close to albania was one the the most countries the origin and ahead the immigrants to the eu
that the course for problems
we have however also a another problem in albania
a large number albanians leave their country because the insecurity in the country the social difficulties the outdated society and 
they leave the country and the is a document future the this country lost
we must help in this country situations to create which the people will continue the safety must guaranteed are there must employment be created so the people not leave
we must course also prevent that albania expressly in a  for refugees drugs and women
the is a country which many the interfere which also many neighbouring their hands turned make
therefore must we this country help
we do the if european union
we lead the police the
we help them the the  the problem is however that in this country so neglected is that there but slowly progress be made despite few efforts the the government
a thing like i like say mrs karamanou if albania not safe country the origin is and we the albanian refugees otherwise deal than other can albania there also not claim the make to together with us a association and  the to to
than is the still not as far but i am the opinion that the already many further is
for i is albania a country which the the people can repatriate
people be this not persecuted
the is still not all rosy and rosy but the is better than you outlines
mr the president the action the in are analysis the that the current situation in albania reason to concern the
the lack social economic and political relations in combination with therefore respectively lack legal and organised crime lead to massive migrations
albania is a important country the origin and ahead the immigrants to the european union
hand are there also positive forces the the democratisation and development the the society achieve and the we must and will support
repression the the migration to the eu from and through albania that is the main objective the the action
this are two measures need
one must the positive forces in albania be supported hand must legal channels for the migration from this region be introduced to illegal migration and trafficking to to gravely prevent and the the the on various forms the crime as black work and prostitution
we have special the albania appropriate preventive measures need the the aid are the the construction respectively reconstruction the the country
as can a individual life in the region possible be made and would many reasons for departure asylum and flight loss
but what we the the other on need have are nevertheless uniform legal channels for the migration to the whole european union
the can the however not the intention are to criminal acts to legalise
networks the traffickers are not aid the our thank deserve because they people save the persecution by totalitarian regimes
paid  the usually properly to crossborder criminal deserve with their their affairs many money the the suffering and the hope the people and to not generous humanitarian aid
the by member  schröder published proposal to subsidies the the traffickers to to must in this the than also if counterproductive and reprehensible be condemned
you has certainly right mrs karamanou because the board are not the root the the evil
the root the the evil is also not the european union
the root the the evil is the situation in the countries the origin
i welcome the action to but can i not with the mr karamanou the in its report illegal regional not if criminal act therefore if legally describes
if we causes and not only symptoms want combat have we aid need from the focused region programmes and a regulation for the whole issue the immigration asylum and very in the european union with solutions the meet to the the immigrants but also the the recipient countries
applause
mr the president in unlike to the mr pack believe i that how more groups the with albania deal how better the is
the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens is a proves for this problems because the are not difficulties the in short time can be resolved but issues where we still decades years that faced will be
the would therefore useful are if the before programme that by mrs karamanou good in other is the distinction would make between measures the the short term can be introduced measures the medium term and the circumstances the historic roots have itself we already year fighting a fight that us still the hundreds years will costs
legal instruments make part from the the measures the medium term the find the fair customs and  judges is also a economic issue and the decades years in up
the last days to there thank positive signals the the balkans the indirectly also albania concern
the report as a remarkable fact i course only a part to the briefly to the namely that the action for albania and the every region by a group is up
the this way to documents the the one institution to the other and the european commission refuses example the report on under other the   mission  know to make that by the albanians is up
that is a another risk the the albanian issue the suspicion rice that someone something like hide something like measures that in reality not there
who the albanian situation know understand that the not as diplomatic is the most people the the local public life to mention there can because the everything done between countries in a transitional and the industrialised world the the if aid right
what the support the the albanians the is everything clear and transparent mr the president therefore i think that the publication the all data a act the political justice is the must to speculation at the interests to prevent
the general problem is course albania all possible aid to make to the crime to combat and the living the the people to alleviate so less people emigrate
mr the president this is a very good report with a human some but the intention is nevertheless the  the and by albania a stop to to to
the eu has a very sad policy developed that for the the part the closure the our borders amounts
but how must this done
why flights people
course flights they for oppression terror and war but they flights perhaps also for chaos and poverty
the expect the the human to a better life in the future for itself but probably especially for the children is a the the most and law motive
we can the simply not make the door to the for all people the here try to flights
we must better methods find
the hard method the police can used be when there there is the women or children and after
by the borders more to the will the  the a crazy way increase
course is there not  solution for the hand but the short term is the is a world the justice safety and with future to create
this applies both for the albanian population if for people from other countries the through albania the heading that the european union proposed try to achieve
our   to the usa to this a life in freedom to find least that thought they
we try the people the today same do against to the
unfortunately must we the that western today trying laws to make to the people the the unborn grandchildren the anne ff hide to can penalties
the is incredibly that we us to this level reduced have
late us try the truth under view to see
we will never in peace and freedom in a world the prosperity and justice can life when we as even unfair are the the most near neighbours the the european union
president commissioner the greens the the group want mrs karamanou rapporteur congratulate with its report the is very correctly
the is indeed as that there measures must be taken in the with the migration migration from need and that the causes must be these
what i additional like stress is the situation the women and children in albania
the is the first dramatically how young people there disappear deception be and take or sometimes also wanted 
there are not rights in albania not  not women many aggression against women in the family by the man the spouses not  and total not human
 is the situation in the villages the ecological level the turned the all  the water is not always fulfilled and the electricity working bad
the people hope course the a better political representation but now are there still many people anxious the with fear for everything and still what and anxious also for the violence the there the and to are
there is also a gap between the donors we all europe the united states the money give projects issue and such and the people itself the the area
a another problem that i like raise is the problem the the reception the albanian victims the women
they to back to their country but there is not reception for
there is a reception the the  for victims from under more montenegro but not for albanian girls the back from italy greece germany belgium etc
there must result given be the the call the ngos the the 
there is also the threat that they again will be arrested by the  and back to the countries the destination
the economy must instruments be in combination with good ecological policy
there must work be made the schools and childcare
support must be granted the the people the over the the area in the ngos work
there be good things done the iom is achieved work the european police make achieved work the kfor is this present but also the local population must help the the development the their country
perpetrators must punished be
mrs karamanou congratulate with the comprehensive broad blame in your report
mr the president first like i mrs karamanou congratulate with its quality stable work i stress especially its comment that the action the with particularly would must deal with the protection the the safe citizens and with the continuing violations the the human and not much with the way which migration to the countries the the union can be limited and send
the is a fact that albania if country and if society with large problems to camps has
the in the country changes economic social and political circumstances to the citizens to the their does elsewhere to seek emigration is for them and for their families literally the only 
the situation was quickly backwards when the activities the the by the european union supported political forces in to the phenomenon the the  led which the savings the the citizens if on for the such they with the savings they however same also the confidence in the structure the the albanian the and are organisation
end led this to a uprising which the albanian the as good if was abolished and large security political and economic problems existed for the albanian citizens
enormous quantities arms were when in hands the brought groups the the quickly  in new criminal
the problems in this area were still increase by the events in kosovo and the nato
do if you to trying and a wall forces the you heading to the desperate people from you neighbour against to the witness not only the inhumane but also shortsighted behaviour
course like everyone in are own country live provided he this safe and individual can life desperate people be you however with not possibility stop
therefore would we there good the do the repressive measures stop to to and two other roads to path
the first must we albania help are economy new life in to revive and are population back to to and the second must we the albanian immigrants in our countries legalise the are not wanted animals and we should them not exploit by they black to let work or they to use already to according us that arrive
in greece are example very what work on the albanians if the albanians would leave would very many work with particularly in the agriculture simply continue are
let we therefore move to bilateral agreements and the a legal and clear definition give the the work the duration and the place the residence the salary the much the working and the social facilities than will the immigrants our countries can help the our economic progress and contribute the the the the friendship and cooperation between the peoples
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i like first mrs karamanou congratulate with its report on this extremely subtle and important issue
i like like the two the the many important issues the i i our attention questions
the first issue the the with the structures and developments in albania after the events and counter during the recent elections counter the especially at were against the greek minority in albania is has how same the structural problem is
therefore must the european union in first body contribute the the creation the structures which democratic rules in eight can be taken and the rights the the minorities in albania can be recognised and respect
the second issue the the with the enormous and indeed very complex 
this is a very important issue that the the by historic social political and economic factors
precisely because this however such a topics issue is must here the head the be is with a topics policy with a policy without high approaches with a policy which a dynamic legal system can be created a legal system is because a the part the any the that the problems can solve and the not limited to repressive actions also if this actions the result are the the application the the law
i i are we now far that we this measures can decisions and impose
the time is ready the circumstances are ready and everyone know that if we this hard make we a very good service proof
mr the president i welcome the drafting the a action for albania to and also the committed report the my mr anna karamanou
the the hand the its analysis the the political and economic situation in albania can we the causes the migration better recognise and appropriate measures take
my criticism the this action and also the the other plans the are up is that the especially is on measures the control and fight
albania is a the the poorest countries the world and has itself hundreds refugees included
there is now a strong number the refugees what fact in contradiction is with the lack the safety right and item
there be people back the for a part good integrated were
young people must their training down and to a insecure future meet
that is not slim policy
the repatriation must place under circumstances which the honour and the safety the the involved the guaranteed
therefore is the absolutely need to a planning the to to for the coordination the the return and especially also to nongovernmental organisations and international bodies the to involve
the situation in albania wealth i still still if very serious in of the political instability the neglect the laws and the extremely high crime
year after year especially in the summer risk thousands people their life the way to the eu
hundreds the this refugees find the the death the sea
the real number deaths will we never to know to
the kilometres long continentalisation with italy is difficult to control and offers networks the board the with large contempt for people to work to a enormous 
criminals the the difficulties the the refugees exploit must be penalised
against the trafficking in the particularly the small children the exploitation the people for black work and prostitution must the the who way be in
but who think that only the combat the  the illegal immigration will prevent mistaken the
what we need have is a intensification the the dialogue between the different negotiation and  and a better coordination
only as can we a common contribution make the the combat the the exploitation the refugees by traffickers
the community must albania support the are efforts to strengthening the the rule especially with the view the the financial support that like i stress should we albania and the every region not in the abandoned let
to finally request i the council the again to steps to take for a community approach the the policy with the to migration asylum and fight the the trafficking
mr the president support the albania and the every region is the large important for the stability in europe
the conditions the the democracy and the the the a rule is necessary
we should the peoples in need not forget the is our duty they as good possible to support
with the action for albania and the every region can we the stability in the region increase
the emphasis must not are the how the immigrants and refugees must be limited but how the circumstances in the region as can be improve that the people in their own homes can continue live
albania and especially kosovo are however still not  regions and therefore must the return the refugees governed done without their safety in risk to to
the situation the the albanians in kosovo is long time very difficult been and the is very good that their rights last be recognised
the is however just as necessary the rights the the minorities in kosovo the serbs and gypsies to guarantee
the restore the the peace between the population is a longterm but very necessary process
only apologise is a revolutionary foundation for the build the the future
economic growth makes the possible the problems in crisis to overcome
only financial support is not we have entrepreneurship the the level the the ordinary people need and must the own initiative the the people support
joint transactions link the people the peaceful way with other
the importance the the cards the the european union the the a utmost in because without good administration work nothing
we must they help itself to help
precisely now has the region a  opinion hand need
the european union has if partner the the balkans a large responsibility for the future the the region
we must us egoism in the brings bear and recognise that their and us fate with other linked are
mr the president when i two months ago the rapporteur the i moreover the i welcome with its work early in paragraph the the report reference to make the the need the safety and the protection the the national minorities in albania to improve what the rapporteur has done were my mind course from to more general the bad the the service the this country what the respect the the rights the the minorities and with particularly the greek minority the are territory the
i must however honest confess that i never had expect as quickly a category proof to to the the bad behaviour the the albanian authorities
the their attempts the result to provided and with their source violence action against the candidates and electorate the the greek minority which objective taken there the official international observers have the albanian authorities unfortunately demonstrated that albania not in the is the most basic obligations in the rapprochement to the european union after to to albania demand however the that the international community the oppressed albanian minorities in third countries to aid inadequate even with arms
the case the greece is characteristic although greece albania after the fall the the communism the all possible point has help and thousands albanian immigrants and illegal immigrants welcoming has included must the ensure how are large historic minority in albania systematically the persecuted and how the fundamental political and cultural human constantly be violated
the unacceptable events in himara force us i i careful to are in us believe on the ability and the like the albania to the the accepted european criteria the the area the the human and the democratic freedoms to meet that means therefore that we more general reluctant must are in us behaviour in our plans and support the this country and this possibly must adapt as albania are policy not invite
mr the president just if the mr dimitrakopoulos think i that albania the already are problems the economic and social area and the the area the the internal safety the most might is the reconstruction the the rule protection the the citizens restoration the the authority the the institutions and the local authorities
if the democratic level the the country not improves also with the view the the last elections and the unparalleled  can we the problems course never solve
the am i that in the final report last two points which we italians many gentlemen attach be mentioned and the gentlemen be estimated
the first a instability albania means a instability balkans and a instability balkans means instability in europe
that must we us all achieve
the second just as where the migration and the albanian crime should not the the shoulders the italy and greece only be been
many have their solidarity and  expressed but i like remind remind that the only real solidarity to still to the the italian gambling and the the local institutions is has
i i the europe not specific working given where the is to the joint respond the the problems the a people
what i however unacceptable think in this report and i say the downright is that cause and result by other be achieved namely a procedure for the considered issue the visas and therefore the possibility to to emigrate with the cause the the illegal immigration
the is exactly versa let we cause and result not by other to
i think the especially unacceptable and negative for albania that the a signal the tolerance the the illegal immigration like give
that is something what albania not need has
albania has our specific economic support need our effective solidarity but the must also  be than because albania must only and with our aid the succeed to the may the a rule to index
mr the president for many in the eu is albania far the the had further than the kingdom the  while the albanians a the the oldest european  are
they have in the medieval against invasion by the  rich struggle and the to far in our modern time who  if europeans
they have especially very under european contempt ago
in the nineteenth century has the all peoples the the balkans a perspective given the the congress the berlin the
but the albanians has the in berlin practical the table aside the has not account with they taken in the twentieth century have they under a the the most terrible ideologies the the century ago namely under the socialism and communism in are particularly cruelty alternative
therefore to we now a european responsibility for this european albania
therefore welcome i the principles the the report and the action to
we must however good careful that we not with two standards to measure
there is here many on the human said
i would say rightly demands we the the albanians rights for all minorities
but than must we the also in the whole european union introduce
that is us still not managed
we have not european standards for the protection the minorities
in all neighbouring the albania except kosovo where the albanians the majority forms have we to make with albanian minorities and this can we let see what the  the the eu are
i like still something say
i am with mr liese the opinion that we a distribution the the burden need have the the asylum and policy
the problem is however that we this already have struggle but that we both in this parliament if in the european union not majority to for a distribution the the burden to quota
we see now precisely the the case the albania that the any member agree can happened
therefore is the the important that we not longer the the symptoms others but that we last a solidarity asylum and policy with fixed quotas and a stable distribution the the burden create before the disaster place
mr the president in the conclusions the the european council the tampere was a more foreign policy the the area the legal and internal affairs called
the before action is a important measure the strengthening the the foreign policy
the large institutional changes the say from the treaty the amsterdam are the influence been the how affairs with the to asylum and immigrants be regulated
the community is now in the to meet the the demand the the european council by use to make the its new powers the the area the the foreign policy and its programmes on external relations
in the stability and process the with the albanians if equal partners on  about
similar discussions would in the whole region must be held
after is in the framework the the phare already in total million euro the various support allocated
the last two year is the the country also million euro the humanitarian aid through the psychosocial allocated
legal and internal affairs have a important share in the the phare next cards
we want especially emphasise that we our full support give the the comprehensive position and to the the group the high level for asylum and  to the are to the with the real reasons for the forced migrations
the general council approved already last year may the five first plans the the had the forces sri sri afghanistan morocco and iraq good
the action for albania and the every region was in june this year already approved and that is therefore the sixth in list
the european council the tampere  the council and the commission the in december this year report from to to on the progress the the work the the group
in that report the the action for albania and the every region detailed dealt
the draft the today in the council dealt
the commission is active involved the the up the the report
i like the rapporteur mrs karamanou and the whole commission thank for this very thorough report and i hope that the council account the with the the adopted positions
i like still three positions to the to
the first supports the commission a many attitude the relation the the in the action proposed measures and the implementation that
what that the are we the with the rapporteur agree
the second seems the situation what the the objectives the the action for the year free positive to are
the commission has part the the up the a overview with the to the implementation the the action
we want also the member thank for their contribution the this work
as i already i said trying the community its programmes as effective possible from to to
that the the priority the the whole union
the third and the finally must the action and the implementation that per region be examined
the pact for europe offers this a excellent forum
the participants the the pact have already several statements in the direction done
we can than also with still more hope look to the next month to the summit in zagreb
thank you the commissioner liikanen
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the legislation improve reports
the the item is the debate on the report a the the mr wuermeling behalf the commission legal affairs and internal market on two reports the the commission the the european council
the legislation improve a shared responsibility com c cos
the legislation improve com c cos
rapporteur the mr the president ladies and gentlemen gentlemen mr programmes first like i you thank that you the this thursday still part the this debate
also like i the mr programmes the the commission legal affairs and rights the the citizens you thank for the constructive and indepth discussion the we on this subject have held
further am i for the comprehensive contribute the the made committees many thank owe the i the like express the the mr the den berg the the commission constitutional affairs and the mr  the the commission petitions
indeed have we a very seriously debate held on the quality the the european legislation and the application the the principle the subsidiarity which we ourselves critical meet are into
what conclusions have we drawn
we have noted that the quality the the legislation to wish house with particularly in the becoming the the citizens
this affects the time to time frustrated but is often also not familiar with the european legislation we want than also ourselves mobilise and also the other community institutions call to the difficult small work not from the way to to and this the necessary time and staff free to make
however not only the quality the the legislation is the important we must also with policy to work to where the the quantity the the legislation the not each problem that the in europe happens is because also a problem for the european union
we are than also a large favour the what the commission in its strategic objectives for to has explained
the commission about the that we us to our core must to
affairs give which the the has been is the and to a embarrassing process
unfortunately show examples from the most recent history the that the commission and also the european parliament here not always in succeed
you will the the rules for the climb the ladders remind what we recently have dealt
further remind i i standards for the institutions the ships control i hope that i the translators this not for problems i and the proposal for a directive on  the indeed to objective has a  for the whole european union the to to
the commission legal affairs and rights the the citizens calls the commission emphatically the the head to offer the the by its voicing 
this is not excuse to things to do the fact not need are
but course applies this call to efficient with european legislation to to to also for ourselves
the be we help by the subsidiarity that to the opinion the the commission legal affairs and rights the the citizens also must be applied the the decision or a certain issue to subject the legislation on the internal market must be made
this principle must also fully be applied the green and white and the action programmes
the can not as are that the european union the this point claim makes the full competence
also here is a specific absolutely and a seriously  necessary
we have the the opportunity also about on a trend the us concerned namely that still more decisions not more be taken by the institutions the democratic are legitimacy
the first considerations in the paper on good governance the the commission give somewhat to think
because when the large scale networks must be the while for the other  law the was when by the commission guidelines for interpretation be adopted and when many affairs be regulated by means the agreements between the involved parties than will this certainly a good reason are but the responsibility the the legislator must the not be limited
we ask the commission urgent to account to the with the distribution the the powers both between the european union and the member if within the institutions
with this report want we to the citizens the signal give that we the complaints on the lack quality the the legislation and on  and centralism seriously take
i request you than also remind the to to that this signal the television and this report the the commission legal affairs and rights the the citizens good to approve
mr the president first like i behalf my group the rapporteur congratulate with are excellent consistent and detailed report
my group has however already in the commission and in the plenary sitting a large number amendments tabled not because they like discounts the the quality the the report but because we especially what the the scope the the subsidiarity the political view differences
we want a strong union the the say the all tasks the the its path to the a functioning internal market creates and the the actually possible makes to the social and regional cohesion to strengthen
the must possible are all common the to act if the the the place a better higher european added the created
precisely now must the emphasis be the the the force the this common action
the first have we especially with the view the the revolvers having enlargement a strong european union need when we the future member and their inhabitants want help and we the many  want see which we within our member will be subject
the second must we precisely in the european parliament the emphasis to the the paneuropean and common aspect especially in a time which we must see that this involvement the the governments the many member decrease and which shortsighted selfishly nationalism and isolation action hand on hand increase
when we however want that common form the given the all important european wish and this also the accepted and supported by the citizens than is the necessary that we us more than ever the the essence concentrate and many affairs the now the the agenda are again delete
further am i that convinced that we the better agree can be on what necessary and precisely is if we that per case would do and that we only than superfluous affairs the the agenda would can sections
the is certainly easier to per case pragmatic decisions to take than in the framework the general reports and fundamental debates
this applies with particularly for the subsidiarity but certainly also for the quality the the legal
in place the us to lose in a disappointing fight on general principles would this parliament better per case and more can debate on the need the certain plans and more time and capacity must kind for the quality the the legislation
mr the president mr the commissioner colleagues i would first and especially the rapporteur the mr wuermeling want thank for the way which he work has made the are report
the is the the course a free important subject already would the that the the first face in this sitting not say given the small number present to on further to debate
this parliament produces the way the speak the the current link european legislation
to often must we however the to to that this european legislation the  in a to technical to legal to complex language such even that this european legislation unusable the which the intended objective namely legislation in the european union transparent and clear make not the achieved
european legislation must a flexible and a can instrument are that further by the devolved and  also for the air citizens accessible the
with pleased i i can the that the amendments and the the my hand were are approved by the commission legal affairs and internal market
with this amendments  i indeed a ongoing assessment the the  and that the regular way up will be or this indeed answer the the events and that the first carefully looking or certain regulations andor directives the usefulness have
i favour there also for that the changes the the existing ec codified proposals be done which the amendments in the existing directives or regulations be integrated
to finally am i favour the the ensure the a type scoreboard for superfluous legislation
the the outside doubt that superfluous legislation must to be  because the is indeed not sufficient the inflation the the legislation to to the must also the legislation clear make and the the arising obligations must easy to understand are
i hope than also mr the president that this report unamended will be adopted in compared with what the commission legal affairs and internal market has done and that the a useful means will are to the european legislation to simplify transparent and effective to make
mr the president i am welcome with the opportunity the i the is to comment to make the the report the the mr wuermeling and the the fundamental question the this the basis is how can we ensure for good and clear european legislation
i thank the mr wuermeling for are report
  and are large english master    the opinion that laws since they always a certain extent the coercion cover necessarily also a certain extent the evil cover
the can best are that laws a necessary evil are but they the a still greater evil in  laws must however in relationship are to the evil that they want regulate
we accept this view the also in this report the reflected the the because the the clear and simple laws and the proportionality between the legal resources and the intended public objectives
in the report the also the  the the item the obviously is this issue evening controversial in this parliament
subsidiarity is the pope  however the a enemy therefore the the views the  on what a law is
here to however two different  together
the is not good decisionmaking way to take the the most local level the the level where decisionmaking the best can done or this now the individual the family the village the city or something otherwise is
as now and than bag i letters the previous week was i a letter the a the my electorate from the remote area the the west highlands in scotland
he wrote i what do you this fact year long have the people here safe the water can drink from the  and now should they that suddenly not more
they must very complex  apply where no what the has
i hear similar noises the the people the the island  where the as is on the proposal the a large international body to the local  to protect the people this have in the last year better for the seals taken than a international body probably in the future ever will can do
this is the also exactly to
the laws must close the the citizens are local knowledge provided this the most relevant knowledge is must always be applied that is many better than large overall plans
hand are there sometimes however also public interests the the stake the only the the most general level can be strongly certain aspects the environmental and  as certain aspects the the internal market the  legislation the legislation for internet etc can only the the most general level and the are least the european level be tackled
a correctly as subsidiarity the two sides from take decisions the the lowest possible level but aware the that the lowest possible level perhaps very high is when general interests the the stake are the without a all equal protection damaged would be
therefore is this reference to the subsidiarity as important
i i have the mr medina and are mr programmes wrong if they say that this only a political principle is
this is a constitutional principle and as all other constitutional principles has the one political consequences when we legislators namely decisions what laws we want regulation but hand also legal consequences when the court asked the laws to interpret and to to apply
i like to finally the parliament amendment recommend which the commission and the european union be invited seriously account to the with the fact that we as in the union the states autonomous communities communities with selfgovernment in the union have
i represent scotland in this parliament
scotland and england have with the treaty the the united kingdom the and since also maintained
year long has scotland however are own system retain something that the central were between the civil right the continental europe and the common law the england and the united states but the laws were from westminster
in the last year have we a continue parliament the
the scottish law is again home the continue criminal is again home
therefore would the you pure opposed are if we precisely now now we that for everything have been very the legislative power on  punishment and commercial would transfer to the union
i i is that not the intention and will that also not done
the must the important the subsidiarity in the monitoring the when the is to the levels below that the the member and the the level between the member and the union there is not few reason why we the here in the affected having constitutional principle not the each level the this large union over and generous would interpret
mr the president i think that we welcome should are with the quality the this report
subsidiarity is often a vague concept in the view the our citizens but i assure you that they a good application that the price to
the excellent speech on subsidiarity the the mr wuermeling is the fruit the decisionmaking the a level that as close possible the the hardly the the citizens with
we would the indeed very the price to if the commission us more details would provide on the good application the this principle the any proposal so they the balance can made the its annual
also would we the very interesting find if they a overview the the the legislation in the light the this principle to this to simplify more more and guide to make and to mean the superfluous texts what also in paragraph the this report the asked
if example like i directive because the the was to the submit the a written statement on the management the the  the already signed is by many mr programmes
the is the important a such text to review when this not more meets the are original objective or overtaken and inadequate is and the the the to disputes the many damage do and him not popular make
although i i as the rapporteur  to a quality quality legislation us i still more to a fundamental complementarity between us parliament and the national parliaments
the is indeed the important to they the to encourage their full cooperation to to the a better application the the subsidiarity
who can better than they assess what they itself can the national level and what consultation the european level require
the igc offers the state for who this report intended is a fine opportunity to the measures the both the european if the national level taken must be to assess
to decision some amendments think i very sense but i i my reservations regarding the logic the some other amendments which the reality and the important the a principle that by the treaties is confirmed the the on seems to be been
mr the president the work that the mr wuermeling has done for are report is the the height is
this report is on simplification and clarification the the legislation the rapporteur has there therefore for must ensure that are report the same expectations would meet if which legislation must meet
this report is a fine the brevity become and i hope really that the mr programmes this  will take
also i i fully behind the comments the are made on subsidiarity but i like they the in a wider framework places in the framework the the reform the the european commission
from all communications the we have received and especially also from the important that the commission importance the agreement between powers and resources that clear that the commission itself presented that they less legislation must produce and more resources must to in the application the what they already has decided
indeed is there now many too legislation the not good the observed
if legislation not good the observed the they not worked the the these
that must for us a part are the the revision which in this report the the
i importance here large importance the and i am with particularly welcome with the emphasis the the mr wuermeling the the certain aspects in the with control by the national parliaments
a the the the problems the the european union and this has especially consequences for this commission from the position the the internal market is that what now published the sugar the the eu the mentioned
the commission must not only a look throw the the transposition in national legislation
they must also look what the national parliaments the the legislation have made
there are many examples which that that even a relatively simple document legislation for the internal market a common standard a common principle sometimes the national level end in  legislation and considerable problems i like the commission questions this issue the the sugar carefully to look
let we agree six clear examples take and look how this are into how the details are how the legislation in the countries itself working how they the maintained
let we a clear and transparent assessment make the what there actually the the legislation is happened if legislation namely not worked the the these the have we here all our time are wasting
mr the president first remind i the the his gesture the the mr maccormick to to my comment in the commission legal affairs and internal market to refer
the mr maccormick says rightly that the subsidiarity according i not legal but a political principle is
after precise examination the the report am i even to the conclusion has that the not political but a theological principle is
according the mr maccormick is the principle the a pope from the is indeed not to deny that the full the the  considerations
in the the century has a fact dutch lawyer  the large international know if grotius a the the more the the international right the  warned the however especially not the legal area to really he used the the famous sense   in  
i concerned the this opportunity use to my feelings the sympathy admiration and proportion the the commission on to to because the fact that they the with this type principles must deal
there is no the the second paragraph the article the the treaty to up the the european community understand
what this the is not legal definition but a 
mentioned paragraph reads if follows the areas the not under its exclusive competence the into the community accordance the subsidiarity only the if and as the objectives the the considered action not sufficient by the member can be implemented and therefore because the extent or the consequences the the considered action better by the community can be implemented
no the here something the understand
as there also no something understand the the protocol the the treaty the amsterdam on the application the the subsidiarity or the statement no
the poor commission has with the reports the legislation improve and the legislation improve a very regarding attempt done to a shape to give the already the follies the the member in the treaty on the european union and the supplementary protocol have confirmed
the report the the commission legal affairs and internal market is not very enthusiastic by its members received
that can be secondary from the fact that there the the commissioners for the resolution have voted the votes
that like say that there more votes than vote for were
the reason the the large number votes is that the social and also other members the the commission the very sceptical have used on the excessive way which the understanding subsidiarity in the report was interpreted
the understanding subsidiarity is as in the report the the commission legal affairs and internal market the explained a understanding that in  terms the interpreted if theological principle is the however whole outside the community scope
we have amendments the the report the the legal commission tabled
we support also amendment the the group the the european liberal and democratic party
we hope that the european parliament our amendments can adopt if that as is than vote we for the resolution
as not than see we us must against to vote
mr the president in this short speech like i the amendment the the mr maccormick support he has the merit under this circumstances to have given that the subsidiarity not only a legal and perhaps a theological principle is but certainly also a principle with a large  scope that like say the is immediately relevant for the daily life the the citizens
what is a the or a  otherwise than the result the a  between the citizens
if the a  is is the the responsible for the framework which are citizens the own needs try to satisfy but he the not decisions for them
if the the the responsible for the framework is and not decisions imposes follows the that in the construction the the mr wuermeling the powers the the member like transfer in the sense the the subsidiarity a supplementary guarantee requires is that the member according same principle will act
there must therefore guaranteed be that the subsidiarity to the the smallest communities respected will be to the the autonomous groups the mediumsized units the social units the families and the citizens the only real  the legislation and the implementation that
therefore like i in this intervention with particularly my support express for amendment the paragraph commission tabled by the mr maccormick that according i in are whole a constitutional and not theological subsidiarity 
mr the president this report and few opinions let but again agree see how complicated the make the legislation is even the deal the reports in the parliament is not the simple
if member the the economic and monetary commission i i a opinion up that in principle the this report was our that opinion was however a report on the 
this mistake the doubt also caused by the constant electricity initiatives the from the commission with the to the legislation be undertaken
the commission is the aware the the shortcomings in the community legislation and is therefore constantly with reports which the proposed the legislation to improve or to simplify that order i in the report on the 
the community legislation is because even for experts hardly to follow the mr medina ortega has us of just with the read the a the the articles the the treaty a good example let see
mr the president already my comments with the to the  are also here the application
that say i if member the the economic and monetary commission the the the most addressing to the cause the the area the  and the little transparent legislation
however is the few confidence that we perhaps in the improvement the the legislation have for us not the the subsidiarity the same way to interpret if the group the the european party the combat the this sitting
the effort consequence the the reasoning would namely are that the community especially not things must do the by the member done can be
in same line have we the mr mauro just hear defend that everything but the family or  must place and that any form the administration scrapped can continue
that would to a for us certainly unacceptable situation the anarchy lead
mr the president the first apologise i you the commission and all colleagues my apology the for the fact that i to late am i come the a other sitting and could here not earlier are
various speakers the the group the the european party have the already used on the way the the group
perhaps must i the just briefly summarise
the first think i that the often very difficult work the the commission course all praise deserves
in this report the legislation improve be there scarcely two paragraphs the the subsidiarity devoted
that has course everything to make with the complexity the this principle that we even a theological principle are to mention
the principle the however in the treaty and can therefore for the court the justice be the
to now to are there not cases the noncompliance the the subsidiarity been we can there however not choice that the principle in the treaty is included
mr the president otherwise said is the subsidiarity perhaps the principle which the importance the the european construction the best the balance end is the not more than the political like as this in the treaty is expressed
the way which the the subsidiarity fulfil the given depends for a large part the the the political like the a the at
for a number aspects the the report can i than also little enthusiasm people i had would a report had with many more attention for aspects on the internal market
the report the the however not with this subject are mr the president the report is on affairs the the a very another level are
 and simplification are important and must to be welcomed but only if that legal responsible shortcomings
i request the commission than also to next year to to with a report on the application the the subsidiarity with all consequences the that with the of also see we like a report on the application the administrative and  meet
mr the president i like you thank that i if rapporteur the this report still just something must say on amendment the the group the the european social
there is various times said that the the the subsidiarity to a theological principle is
i like you in this framework remind the a speech the pope john paul ii the four weeks ago which he explicitly  that the subsidiarity in the political the used
i would already my mr programmes want advise to this way council the i to take
that was although not point the item but if rapporteur had you think i the right this point further to to explain
i give the floor the the commissioner
mr the president i like first the rapporteur the mr wuermeling and the commission legal affairs and internal market the i thank for the work that they for this report on better legislation have done
this is a extremely important issue
we must us always first ask or we for the solution the a problem the legislation need have
if we to the conclusion to that legislation necessary is must we the second look or this european or national legislation must are
if that that european legislation need is must we the third into how we simple clear and  legislation can guarantee
the fourth must we us than ask or there a other way is than legislation to the desired objective the european level to achieve as  law a code or 
i i agreement with the report and with the during this debate to the take opinions indeed will the enlargement us for a enormous challenge places what the quality the the legislation the
the new member will because economic social and legal problems with the would
the legislators the the european union must with this problems account the and this respect subsidiarity proportionality quality better legislation simple regulations more codification this are all important political issues where we our attention the must focus
the situation the the existing acquis community is always a useful exercise often that the that the not always necessary is european legislation to make or that example a certain legislation to detailed is for european legislation
i like not indepth discussion start on the  or political history the subsidiarity
for the european institutions is the only important that we us with all force concentrate the the improvement the the  especially when the the subsidiarity in the affected is
the commission trying both the political if the internal level the subsidiarity in its legislative to processing
the initiative to the write the a paper on good administration is a example the our attempts to the subsidiarity the all levels hard to make
the rapporteur mentioned the issue the the   or other agreements
i i are this very important issues the discussed must be
i see here few the your mr programmes are the a important role have played the the regulations the the society and internet
can we the regulate if the technology the as fast development
there not the risk that we with our regulations the development precisely programme
there not the risk that by the rapid development the the technology the problem the the at that the legislation on and ready is long is changed
that are issues the we with a very open attitude meet must act i like here a very personally position to the to
i i is the possible the other ways to regulate in place the regulations and  if alternatives to see would the must try they to combine
if however the elected for  for agreements the voluntary basis must we that the the can that they be applied we must they can enforceable
we must can control or that what agreed is also indeed the observed further must be up what role the european parliament the can play
there can open discussions and discussions open brilliantly place what the involvement the the european parliament guarantees how more we however in detail act the the information the the rapid development the internet how more we according i to the conclusion will to that detailed legislation not solution is for the problem or that if the somewhere already a solution for is this certainly not solution is for the problem the the information
there are also other areas the the internal market where we faced are with very complex legislation
i mention only the socalled  car programmes where the commission the on few weeks that are will the
this directive would pages long can are there would i know not how details in can be included with all calculations and a hope expertise
is this however a area where we must  the detailed legislation the all guaranteed the applied would we not rather must look or a voluntary agreement perhaps a alternative is provided this course can be applied and controlled
such things will we in the next years must discuss
i hope that this report that we commissioners last year have been in the future subsidiarity will include and will into in better legislation in the balance the alternatives the must course the legislative powers the the council and the parliament fully in eight be taken
to finally like i still clear make that i account will the with the criticism in the report the the parliament
this is a clear and president report
i will the message pass the my mr programmes in the commission and the commission will its best do to here the constructive way the in to to this say i also with the view the the preparations the the next report
i hope that we this debate can continue this must not  are for the thursday but must part are the the large debate on the community legislation in its whole

report a the the mr wuermeling behalf the commission legal affairs and internal market on two reports the the commission the the european council
the legislation improve a shared responsibility com c cos
the legislation improve com c cos
the parliament the the resolution the explanations
welcome a
i i for the report voted although i with few amendments not from the being could because in the report also the high costs for exchange and transferring within the euro the the item to
the commission has the july banks in belgium finland portugal and ireland reprimanded because broadcasting practices where the the costs for the exchange the currency within the euro the
the commission has the almost banks and  points the objection transmitted
the was the banks a term the the was to beginning october the end the to can no the banks was however clear made that the commission hard would action against prices the the calculation the costs when this a customs would forms for the introduction the very and currencies and the consumer would disadvantage
since january are the exchange you the
the is understandable that the citizens not understanding has for the permanent high costs since the banks since the date not sharply programmes more have got
this costs there still still both the the exchange the counterfeiting if the crossborder payments
given the fact that we now life in a common market with a common currency is the unacceptable to this many to high costs to let existence
the continue the this situation would the attitude and the acceptance the the citizens the regard the the euro negative can influence
if the banks not help and within the euro high costs in account continue to is the risk that the consumer is doubt the the usefulness and the objective the the euro large
i call the banks the the to the by the european committee for the standardisation the crossborder payments  developed standards for a direct and automatic items the crossborder  between banks as soon possible to to apply
a research in the eleven countries the the euro has demonstrated that the consumer for the transferring the euro between the member still always average euro the costs must pay
the this untenable situation must as soon possible a end be made
banks and credit must the many more to make to the costs for the transferring the small sums to reduce
i request the urgent to giros cheaper more and reliable to let has
after the introduction the the  euro is the everyone noticed that the into the money the you account more the if you the border on is
the old  between purchase and sale is replace by a fixed tax per 
if on fifteen months also still agree in eleven member same currencies and notes be introduced will the outside the country where you live more are to that  in hands to to
same at the by the high bank the small payments to the abroad
for the inhabitants the our countries continue the borders an maintained also if the states many the their powers transfer the the european union and national banks on the borders across merge
apart the the uen the the comes if acting the the french banks calls today any group that this not good
but what do we remind
commissioner bolkestein replies that he this problem think the to solve by research and by free competition in place the by handling
are passivity is the best guarantee for permanent costs and liabilities
as banks only intended are to large profits to make and they not under democratic control be the will this blight continue continue
karamanou a
mr the president we have within the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs with the the care the karamanou prepared
i thank mr karamanou for the effort the they this has spent
we have the compromises closed the for us not always satisfactory were but the on the general acceptable were
the is than also more to more that this report if result the a unacceptable amendment no the mr ludford is changed in a fully ideology report
we must the than also reject i would the group want say that the cooperation in this parliament the den duration will be difficult when within the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs the liberals through mr ludford still again left zero amendments submit
i am the opinion that this not basis is for a good cooperation
gentlemen mr posselt this was all very exciting but with your vote has the little to make
despite i i you not cut
the sitting the to at closed
new  with morocco
the the item is the oral question b the the mr varela suanzescarpegna behalf the commission fisheries the the commission on the the the the negotiations on a new  with morocco
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues the first regret i the the very that  fischler here today not present can are
i i this week personally with him about and the reason the are absence is that the same at in brussels a  place we had moreover from our commission fisheries also already criticism exercised the the fact that this seminar on  which the members the this parliament are invited interests with the partsession in strasbourg especially this the calendar the the parliament a year the advance the public
that is doubt a aggravating fact
i i this the the mr fischler said and i repeat my words here now in the public
given the this situation and in the were that the negotiations next monday in brussels will be opened fear i that the commission us today not many information will provide because the because from monday october to we hope new developments will arise
we should moreover not the the commission expect as the commissioner i itself has said that they here just its strategy for the next negotiations revealing
nevertheless wish i if president the the commission fisheries our oral question and this debate to use to the involved parties our legislative is because the both at in all calm the a number points attention to make
the first like i here emphasise that the commission fisheries the serious ensure makes on the enormous delay the the negotiations have behind there is almost a year has since the previous agreement is last
in the second place like i you attention the the in our commission reached consensus but first and especially like i you remind remind that our assent requires is to a agreement with morocco to the well we have the resolution the here today the vote the presented in between consultation with all groups up and tabled and we have a consensus achieved on the fact that the message the our resolution clear must happened
the resolution contains a number points the additional attention deserve our unconditional support the the european commission to the negotiations with morocco continue to to the call to morocco to the negotiations to open and a for both parties positive and acceptable solution to seek
as in us proposal the suggested seems the us impossible that in the framework the the close relations kinds between both parties the political economic commercial financial and cultural level and in the light the the association not place is for the by the european union desired cooperation the fishing
there is very many area for this type cooperation and with a little good like the both sides must the possible are to a agreement to to
what the conservation the the resources the must the not with two standards measure
the european union used in its common fisheries the principle the responsible fishing and conservation the the grounds this conditions apply for everyone for the moroccans for the europeans and for the in moroccan waters  noneuropeans
this said having emphasise we however also that we not just the first the best agreement can support
we favour for a agreement the the cooperation the fishing promotes and the moroccan fishing strengthened but also the  the the european fleets addresses
the would unfortunately are that the enormous efforts not the desired result would that and that our relations with the sovereign the morocco would down or  the a at that the new young transitional a hopes stage the progress has start which the relations with the european union a decisive role play they must the created expectations because help up
i repeat the would unfortunately are that already this expectations and already this opportunities for mutual understanding in the on were been
in paragraph parts we the the commission that what we the its expect if they there not in fails a satisfactory agreement to the
from this place appeal i i the us authority if democratic elected european representatives to both parties the to should to healthy sense and reasonable the two parties to the october in brussels meet the the matter level the european  and the moroccan minister the fisheries are presence is announced and i hope that the confirmed the and the technical delegations with including the the minister the foreign affairs the morocco if are presence the confirmed and the directorgeneral fisheries the the european union
to decision mr the president like i still say that we many opportunity the succeed have and that the still not to late is although the time unfortunately start to insist
the peoples the the union the we here represent expect that there a solution is
mr the president ladies and gentlemen the commission has in its contacts with morocco still same position to the the that position reflect the by the council in october approved mandate
now is the matter our relationship with morocco a new impetus to give and the specific proposals the the commission forms the best example the the way which we the to work must to to our proposals cover aid the for the the growth and the development the the moroccan fishing accordance the priorities the by the moroccan government in its fiveyear are down
during the meetings the the last months which by the involved parties about is on technical and froze issues are our efforts fully at been the the creation the a new balanced partnership on the fisheries that both parties to benefit must serve
during are last visit the morocco the october on is the mr fischler received by king mohamed vi and has he a maintenance had with the moroccan prime the mr  and with the moroccan minister the fisheries
to the the late regard will the short term long progress made can be because we should adopt that the basis the above discussions actually negotiations the start can to on the content the a new partnership on the fisheries
we are agreed that in this new cooperation the interests the both parties in eligible taken must to be further have we knowledge taken the the fact that the any positive effects the the employment by morocco if a important part the a new partnership be as
the commission has behalf the community again its willingness expressed morocco to support the the development the the fishing but they has also clear made that the the achieve the that objective the european interests not from the view should be lost the interests depend together with the possibility sustainable to fish in the moroccan waters
in our view is the namely the the matter important that the fishermen from from the community their activities can resume the every way that conservation the the stocks guaranteed is
we have than also joint decided to to work to a responsible partnership the moroccan government will its position still explain during a sitting the you has this already the out the october that like say next monday in brussels taken will be
the you i to the finally still the to see that for a good cooperation in the future between the union and morocco a flexible drafting the both parties necessary is under both parties their demands to very the than will we not many achieve
the may clear are that already our efforts there currently the at are to a achieve to to with morocco but the commission preparing in consultation with the directly involved member also aid for the for the the fishing for the case a agreement on a new partnership social
the commission has however good hope that the possible will are with morocco a balanced partnership to the to to and they stressed that the how than also still to early is to the precise nature and extent the to to the the measures
the will only taken be in case the a negative drafting the our moroccan partner
mr the president mr the commissioner tomorrow is the exactly a year ago that we here in the parliament the last debate on morocco have held
the is almost not to believe that there already a very year over is
there is now very what water by the proposal praiseworthy but however is the agreement has without that the is renewed
the has the on extremely difficult discussions and tough consultation
a year later are we here therefore again and would we practical same debate can the
but this to we not further that
i had vain hoped that the sense would mechanistic
now is there a press the the commission published and have we morning the communication the the mr busquin heard
a moroccan delegation will the october its position in brussels explain as has also commissioner fischler i confirmed
repeat the the is to a position the moroccan side
the are the negotiations certainly still not last
i question i even the or this the a beginning that is made
or talk we but what for the country way
we have this week a special sitting the the commission fisheries taken and this a joint resolution approved which we our oral question the morning and our large concern want chiefs
i had my doubts on the sitting the our commission and also on the resolution because we the perhaps in a current procedure intervene while we to now to fact nothing news have heard
was postponement not better been
or have we this the time not for
i can the ensure the the involved fishermen from spain and portugal very good understand
i represent the german coastal and understand therefore how the the fishermen and their families feel they are because already here the the dry and deserve therefore not penny
i was a few weeks ago itself in algeciras a city the the spanish southern the not far the morocco is
the ships areas  in the port and the fishermen are condemned to 
they are dissatisfied and disappointed in europe
the fact that the agreement to now to not is renewed has enormous social and economic consequences this suffering not only few thousands fishermen under but also the over workers in the  industry
there is however also good news the compensation the to the end the the year extended
that is however but a dice the a ocean ocean
the agreement with morocco is course a political issue and course has political also something with the when the situations and with diplomatic skills to make
now there just a weak light the the end the the tunnel to see is must we not with the teeth the table to we
last year is the if a elephant by a blundered  now must there careful be in
great the than excessive the  not must now us orange are
but have we this the enough time for
the discussions where the unfortunately continue
i would want that we commission and parliament together something the concert could to
is the really as inappropriate also in this case that the parliament directly the the negotiations like participate
the important the this agreement and the financial effects that the the community budget justify our participation
why happening that not while the as for the hand is
is there behind the closed doors sometimes something to hide
the  i very what the last developments are how the next decisive days will has and what there can or fact must done to the negotiations successful the to conclude
i expect that there despite the is caution soon a good result the success
i wish the commissioner many congratulate and aspiration and is the moroccan delegation the i welcome
mr the president the is politically that the mr fischler not the this debate present is but the absence the the directorgeneral the mr  seems i still 
i can understanding people for the arguments the the commissioner but the the the directorgeneral to over my hat
mr busquin the says that the commission a college the commissioners is but if this really as was had the i i in the case the such a complex problem if the agreement with morocco however the from the the for a broad approach elected which all commissioners involved were
i doubt or you already earlier on this issue you hear speak they will here in this debate candidly from the before be done
when you here today way is will you very what wiser are become but we will the the leave not on more information have although that fact our only objective was
the  the the european union the the fishermen and shipowners pays is a voting comfort
they have us from the first day said that they wanted fish
also lapses this support the december the date which the fleet must be pervades
the european union makes the the beginning the the third millennium immediately a good start we decided our fleet to because we not in the are has a new agreement with morocco to the
eleven months after the expiry the the previous agreement offers no us the guarantee that the before december only change in this situation will arise
the is little probably that we in few days time a solution find for something that in eleven months unresolved is has
mr busquin i had if member the this parliament sometimes the impression that the european commission the commissioner and especially the directorgeneral fisheries the  for the sector and also for the member the they the this negotiations represented
everyone was from the beginning that the consultation difficult would has
the time taught us that the not only a difficult but perhaps even a impossible task would are
the has because not sense discussions to open without account to the with the wish the the sector while the moroccan demands without only form the discussion be demands
the commission has signals television not the the negotiators the the neighbour but the the european fishermen to many vessels for the fishing the cephalopods fleet with with joint companies need to negotiations per  to open ban to references to make the other commercial exchanges and course the request to to silent
we has there benefit the that silence
the parliament that are obligations the regard the the european citizens must fulfil
the sector the more entrepreneurship the the day the than the negotiators itself and to morocco form to the to to that they the can what brussels not can they are there because in managed directly consultation to commit with the moroccans good contacts to to and principles for mutual understanding the commercial industrial and fishing the to to
the directorategeneral fisheries that there despite the  the very the community apparatus the convinced remains that our fishermen the face are and take that they but what otherwise must to do
mr the commissioner we have the impression that the sector there in at cannot in managed would are the agreement to the that the commission to far still still not has achieved more still we are this certainly the
this insight with not in the negotiations with a country which the european union a agreement has signed and obligations on development is made
the does already at not with a european union the the in the eight to negotiate on the accession the new member
the moroccan government demand a privileged relationship with the european union
they has right and this attitude would for us a reason to proud must are
we are the main  the moroccan fisheries agriculture and industrial
the moroccan agriculture enjoys a treatment what the implement to europe the
the the negotiations on the temporary agreements were systematically final commitments the morocco done the agricultural
otherwise said eleven months after the end the the fishing pay we still still the consequences the the previous agreement and the this closed agreements
the european union wishes with morocco a new agreement to the because we that convinced are that a cooperation can be found which both parties benefit have
the arguments are still same
the reasons the we in this case because are because also the basis the the fact that the european union in morocco the the list the investors the first place its
the first the second and the third that thousands moroccan young the spanish or french universities study
that morocco many european support receive that morocco exists is the us mediterranean policy
if we the employment if the absolute priority the the european union as should we a economic sector if the fisheries not the are fate leave
the health the this agreement would a loss would the least direct and indirect jobs in regions the not for restructuring in eligible to
this are not commitment statement
the commission know but already to good that the agreements for the strong the the fishing dependent areas the vital important are the the with particularly european regions in denmark ireland scotland andalusia portugal and galicia
in place the their competitiveness to develop have they elected for a nonarable activity the the commission apparently still more like electoral the sorry i that i as hard must are for this areas will the from the shipping take the the vicechairperson a heavy blow are the they the lack the alternatives difficult to over will can to
the european institutions must ensure ensure that the citizens and the fishermen europe not if a bse as but the if a appropriate framework for the protection the their interests
mr the president mr the commissioner the fisheries play a large role in the fishing
the agreements with third countries are the large importance for the union and especially for regions with large 
here think i in the particularly the the employment in the sector
i think also the the many among also in the services the whole or partially the the fisheries on are
thanks the fisheries can the union fishing exercise and provided with third countries exchange
therefore supports the liberal group the continuation the this agreements with third countries
the negotiations on a new  with morocco take many to long
since the last agreement the november expired is there negotiated and the union has the spanish and portuguese fishermen already a compensation paid
commissioner fischler has declared that there a end must to the this from
i am the completely with him agree
especially the fishermen understand this situation not and are disappointed that the negotiations on a new  with morocco as long take
the liberal group like that everything now in the work the the to the long negotiations the to the
we support therefore the resolution the the commission fisheries
only the paragraph on the measures the  the the consequences the the health the a new agreement with morocco want we change by remind to to add the in proportional extent by the eu cofinanced be
mr the president a year ago have we a similar debate held the fact that the a year took has before the negotiations even but the start were shows the how difficult the the to resources to find the by our extensive community fleet can be their
the european union is in increasing extent on the the good the other countries to to can fish
five year ago knew we that this situation the would arise
when morocco the last agreement  has the indicated that the not same type agreement more wanted and the has that position since maintained
what has the community in the five year done
the community has a multiannual magps adopted that many weaker was than the scientists and the commission had recommended
the commission complex recently the emphasis the the implications of and took then a structural the which they the with few restrictions new ships and enlargement the existing ships will be paid
but also now weakness the council the courageous proposal the the commission the
if result of have we now to camps with with and reunification resources
this are the the deliberating further reductions the the total permitted catches necessary
the commission the  still further way to fish to seek
the situation with morocco is in the sense special that many the the deploys ships relatively small are and close the house fish
we are the agreed agree that the lack the this agreement negative consequences has had
but while we over sufficient ships have the not can fish in european waters or even the places where they the does have numbers are there in lower countries report or even groups the huge new ships build the far outside europe will must fish
given the problems to this ships the to take within the normal agreements the their owners private agreements the with the governments the third countries
since the here is to private agreements which the community not part there there not transparency not access to information and not aware to the citizens to
this is a very serious situation
who must there monitoring the the this ships
i would the commission want ask us a detailed description to give the its activities and the influence of
we will the resolution support but want the clear make that no the right has to the resources the a another country to operate if the that not wishes
this must account to be taken
we must try the this point our own problems the to solve
mr the president i would welcome are if there a new  with morocco closed would can be but the proposed  contains i i to many weak points
that applies with particularly for paragraph and which the course the considered yes almost a right that the eu must fish in the moroccan waters
such course right there not the is to negotiations with a another country
how would we respond if morocco the same way would demands and the just course would find to in the unsustainability to fish
i think the also not course that the eu fishermen must compensate the in waters outside the european union have numbers
if the the  the the eu if a unity see and not only to this agreement look is a large part the the fisheries by the european fleet outside the union from ecological view and from the view the the natural resources the the long term not viable
there are fundamental changes need so the global fisheries reduce and a smaller part the the budget used the for agreements with third countries
the are because with particularly spanish and portuguese boats the in the moroccan waters fish but there the also numbers by boats from northern including few swedish boats
i read in a swedish  for fisheries how a the this boats are fishing  in  that a moroccan port was mentioned
 is however not in morocco but in the western sahara that occupied is by morocco
i think the odd that  the bound are the  their fishing can other in a occupied country
i would the commission want questions or this issues be discussed during the negotiations with morocco
the what way the the  the the western sahara discussed
and how is the with this agreement possible to a fishing within to to in a occupied country
mr the president we must us here to the on the third  with morocco that especially the important is for our spanish and portuguese friends their fleet is because the the but that also a few french and swedish fishermen affects
and speak we on morocco or on the something  the mauritania or on senegal than have we the course on an  areas
after the creation the the second agreement seemed the situation completely clear
our moroccan friends and i spaniards not few doubt the would the last agreement are
now however must they and i the truth under view see that applies in the first place for morocco that if sovereign the permanent on are own natural resources must can have
the basis the what i just heard i there is about on fish in the waters the a occupied area namely the western sahara will we during the negotiations however not many progress make
the moroccans have right the a sustainable development the their fishing and the intensive small activity the this area they have also the right the basis the the processing the their fish and fish a industry the the on to relationship
the is very understandable that the spanish and portuguese side referred the to certain historic rights
the spanish will the certainly professions the their years presence and their activities in the past also will they point the the economic and social interests the the people the working are in the fishing and the  industry
i i this all understanding for
the european side the out the the important the the euromediterranean partnership and also that is completely understandable
this everything the now the the test the with if result that addition the agreement with morocco actually all fisheries the question under to to are that applies under more for the agreement with mauritania and soon also for the agreement with guinea
the the side the our socialist mr programmes to we again something  being
always strong are our mr programmes for the poor countries and always expressed solidarity with the third world but now be they faced with what president mao the difference between mindset contradictions and  contradictions has mentioned
they must namely a bridge see to we between their ideas on the conservation the employment and their the universal and global values based political conviction and this last the now their the the test the
the is namely very what easier the to to for the interests the the neighbourhoods than for the interests the morocco
must there than a agreement the the third generation closed be with companies with mixed capital which for the in the the large scale  the capital to morocco and in a treatment for this country
i i would first a fair price paid must be for the natural resources
by for a litres oil one francs or less than a euro to pay have we the regard the this resource bad habits developed and that applies also for other natural resources as hevea and cocoa
we must however also in to see that nothing without end is even the  not
morocco is a country with a large people but the know also large problems the demographic and economic nature
this is since the death the his royal   ii still a another problem the namely that the a political power
and the finally is there still the problem the the western sahara a area that in geographical and historic respect a province the morocco is this is a problem which still not final solution found is
today the day the morocco faced with large  the are waters destroying and itself the small moroccan fishermen and the small small from not meet are
the certainly at in the life must the the certain rights distance can do
but that must there not to lead that we the attention lose for the protection the our own natural resources
i think the the the  and the horticulture and the way which the down are and the the interests the southern
gentlemen spanish and portuguese mr programmes the everything is a end in the life even the the fisheries with the third world
mr the president i i is the currently especially important that the end the the tunnel after almost a year in sight is and that we on three days next monday will know where we the to are on three days will the clear be or the cooperation with morocco the fishing the continue and to what for type cooperation the exactly will to
this parliament has rightly criticism exercised the the way which the commission the problem the the agreement has tackled they has because the from the the demonstrated given the enormous indecision and naivety
they has there but as eleven months on done to this point to achieve the meeting the october
from the visit the the  that that the meeting the october not the first the best agreement will are but that in brussels last a moroccan delegation present will are the responsible is to to negotiate and decisions to take that is least the this at the hope the we us can afford
we confidence there therefore the that the cooperation with morocco the fishing the resumed and the as soon possible in for both parties optimum circumstances the would because completely absurd are that the relations between both words the the level the the southern fisheries  and that a fleet the sacrificed the a considerable contribution the the development the the moroccan fishing has made
the resolution the here the vote will be presented contains not many news that can also not since they three days for a important  the adopted
precisely because the vicinity the the important day must we i i particularly careful deal with the wording
a the the in the resolution mentioned points has the given to strong different interpretations which some downright implicated and false are and nevertheless in certain media are published
the group has the agreements still supported defended and promoted more still our group has the especially reform by its measures to to a increase the the number agreements
repeat the this means not that the group the opposition against the private agreements especially this this attitude the existence the the half the the community fleet in risk would to
i question i moreover the or the all the possible is the against this formula to oppose and how the this opposition the before the the fishing can justify
i believe that the our task is new roads for the future the the community fisheries to open not to the
the private agreements which in many member boost use the made and which various third countries are involved have excellent results has both what the conservation the the community employment if the supply the products the the european union the
this is under more the case with namibia south argentina chile brazil ecuador iceland mauritania morocco itself and many other countries
we complain there constantly on that not only the negotiations on the existing agreements but also the consultation on new agreements in the silent risk to are and that the commission and also a part the the council for this issue but carry little interest show the recent examples the angola the  islands and  speak in this respect themselves
both formulas are completely justified the condition that they the fundamental objective the the conservation the the resources achieve
let we therefore the responsibility the us take the us in the framework the the bilateral and private agreements s in this context be the activities the the fleet regulated by regional organisations as iccat nafo and  whose role in the future certainly still will be strengthened
and to finally mr the president hope i from the on the my heart that the meeting the october a success the
mr the president the absence the the mr fischler the as the president the the commission fisheries also already said fully justified is from i a number points in detail divided to to
nevertheless would i few short messages want europe to the here today practises by commissioner busquin represented commission
the first like i the commission attention the its inability to the most agreement the the european union to entailed
i believe that we of note must take and this fact not under torn or banks should to we must us ask or the commission in the is international agreements to the certainly after the request the president prodi to the commission the this point international powers to to know
the second concerned i i ensure on the comment the the mr busquin on the support the the development the the reduction the morocco
the is here to a region the not to morocco one but by this country the run
if we morocco the the overexploitation the this area our aid to in pending the the referendum that under monitoring the the united nations must be taken if we the moroccan fleet strengthen to the grounds the this area to operate what will there than done when this region are right the selfdetermination exercised what must we than do with the moroccan fleet
the third have the not the the control the the commission and the member subject community and noncommunity fleets the exploitation the the grounds the the sahara after the expiry the the agreement simply continue in this the is there with particularly there the a considerable dutch fleet
what measures think the commission to take to to avoid that least the community fleets this resources continue operate
my fourth my join the the the words the mrs miguélez in the framework the the previous agreements has the european union in all respects important commitments the morocco done
when morocco last year the table  has the if a player the a good work does all profits  without also but only commitment to lose
is the european union intends concessions to continue do even when morocco not the least willingness shows to the situation to alleviate
the fifth has the commissioner reference made the the support the the commission the the directly by the current situation affected fishing
this sector represents however only a part the the the the fisheries linked activities
the this at be various spanish regions as the canary islands andalusia and galicia and some portuguese areas directly by the strike the the fishing affected the dockside are staged there be not ships more restore the prime the the ships is against and the  and  work not more
otherwise said very the economic sector is on because there not more the numbers
what if there not agreement or a agreement in the terms the the commission the achieved namely a agreement the the moroccan production promotes is the commission in that case intends structural measures from to legislation to the behind the the affected regions the to catch
mr the president i take the floor to support to express the a resolution which my group and i itself if member from galicia the but already to very agree are
and if we now to try the in the budget for this agreement established sums the other lines to to point than like i however the say that i the commission not am if they says that they the justified interests the shipowners and fishermen like defend i believe than also not that the union and the majority the the member including spain really interested are in a agreement on the the the affairs with the to the political and economic relations between morocco and the european union
who know mistaken i i and will i soon should the that this treaty signed the
president the is today not the first time that the right to again in the moroccan and  waters to to fish here the the agenda is
in spain and portugal was the if course as that morocco european fishermen in are waters had allow and the is if a shocked perceived that this last year a end was
i understand that the because the fisheries was a source the income and employment for a within european relations poor region
in the past was the course that the economy important was found than the protection the the course balance and that the poorest in europe did what  that to it the the majeure the europe the the third world
now see we that parts the seas be  and that certain species such in extent reducing that their existence uncertain the
the is the good right the morocco to are seas sustainable to protect against overfishing
europe can not longer rights claim in other continents
in the future will we must learn life without the from the colonial past  
the proposed resolution will not lead to restoration the the rights but at to a country claim the spain and portugal the 
i question the the european commission to not longer pressure the morocco from to exercise and more understanding to show for the moroccan any
with mrs mckenna am i the moreover agree that there more grenadines are than the spanish and the portuguese fishermen
also the large fishermen from the north including my country netherlands must their catches reduce
mr the president mr the commissioner the european union its already from agreements with morocco
the most recent agreement is in november the the last year last
according the agreement could ships including portuguese vessels freely in moroccan waters fish against payment the million euro programmes per year
the require not speech that the negotiations with the moroccan authorities not easy are been
the moroccans aware but already to good what a gentlemen their grounds represent and they be than also constantly  by large  as japan korea and russia to still elements in their waters to should catch
and than must we there the this point the point that the  with morocco part part the a greater whole the european union its morocco through all cooperation and  not to underestimate concessions
i like here four points stress
first is the as that the agreement with morocco the most agreement the the european union the this area is the is here to the the catches the the community fleet in third countries
that must within the union a low number seem but the is here the to jobs in small traditional fishing and than mainly the the spanish and portuguese coast the can impossible the a other production redeployment
the second like i point the the low willingness the the moroccan authorities i i this certainly effort that
i understand their attitude not
there are meantime a series private licences issued the a number shipowners from other countries and that is in contradiction with the argument if would the difficulties the the european union the its negotiations being the result are the the need to careful to to to with the resources
and than i i also the the inflexibilities the the moroccans if the is to the opening the our markets for moroccan products there the in the framework the the cooperation with morocco the necessary support given
i like here also say that the the end the this month the payments the the temporary support the fishermen and shipowners for the  will be any the situation is unsustainable
the people work would than that they support received the commission and the council the ministers the the european union must their responsibility accept
the support must be centre to the situation is clarify and than must the principles for the cooperation again be there
the commission is responsible for the negotiations the commission must the parliament than also explain what there exactly the the hand is
we are for a escapes and the is i also a escapes why the fisheries nothing within
mr the president gentlemen members blue europe as the the is makes difficult times by
the sea the bad dealt and the extent the the resources the the fishermen are without work and they can the but difficult accept that a as traditional activity and life threatened the
last wednesday have we in this parliament about on the alarming attraction the the  in the irish sea same cod therefore the in the portuguese table a as important role plays
now discuss we the agreement with morocco
and also now again will the fisheries in the european union a heavy shocked to iran to i say european union
and not two member as here by a number members is suggested
the commission is there unfortunately not in managed a new agreement with morocco to the after the previous the november is last
we are now a year further and there is not few progress made
the few information which we have is not very clear they the that the negotiations be continue but that there large problems are
nevertheless has the commissioner us assured that the negotiations next week will be resumed and that there than something achieved will be
that is what he very careful has indicated
the is possible that there a fair agreement with morocco the closed
really or is that a empty promise
the confusion is large the scepticism also
has the european union not weight to our moroccan partners that to convince that both parties benefit will have the a agreement
what is there really the the hand
is the as that morocco a little constructive attitude favour that the moroccans would with companies negotiate than with the european union where they the a significant number areas sends has
has the european union its political and diplomatic weight the in the scale want to
according i not
according i has the european union the problem want down
and if the agreement not continues
what will than the attitude the the council and the commission are
they will however not their hands in innocence want any the council and the commission are in be however certainly the competent and responsible institutions
if the negotiations the nothing going than has the union the moral and political duty to the fishermen and the  resources to provide the to survive
that is the the least but the is not enough
the union must a programme develop for the training the the involved so they a future have
if the union this problem with the structural like solve or the simply covered to the involved member than will same union face suffering not only in the view the the involved but also in the the the citizens
mr the president mr the commissioner the is not in my intention to repeat what here morning already in the plenary sitting is said and where everyone since almost a year the mouths the are has
gentlemen colleagues the reality is that the community fleet in andalusia the canary islands galicia and portugal not can  because there not agreement is
i like the commission there also not again the regulation that they the the negotiations in failed is has or that they morocco not quickly enough under pressure has the
that are affairs the we already used have support
i from member i the last year us initiatives discussed and proposed in the passageway in the offices in the commission fisheries and in the hearings with the commissioner to to guarantee that there account the taken with the own characteristics the the in moroccan waters  from fleet
we have need the a useful agreement
we want not agreement that the interests the this particularly extensive small  on the head see
important  the the the atlantic coast the  to amoco and the southern  malaga granada and  are the this agreement on
this there not alternative for the fishing
hand has the strike the the fishing disastrous social consequences which the  and the trafficking by the kingdom morocco certainly not strange are
than was they not the victims become the the blackmail the the  one thing is certainly if there not agreement the achieved or if the reached agreement worthless that should the consequences of for the special relations the the union with morocco its not health
mr the president everyone know that jean monnet a the the fathers the the european union was
he had the habit a irony on the norwegians to tell
the irony was that norwegians always on fish talk
that is a bad irony
just as bad if the ideas the jean monnet on how the european union developed had be
according him would there in the european union always a group must are and the order he probably germany and france
according the idea can there in the european union not democracy the countries are
but now on fish
i defending norway that not member the the european union is because the european union the the norwegian stocks common possession like make without this more for in the place to to than the political group the jean monnet
i defending also morocco against the  from the european union
the planet be  the a way the the avnoj does think
we must the  in the world work
there must a end to the the with the the european fishing
let we with european money only in the waters the the european union fish
mr the president the czech anglican  with who i i strong linked feel can a score expression to use love would simple are if the closest not as terrible close was
that applies also for the relations between many neighbouring
in the during the the history have precisely neighbouring many with other to to had and the european union is intended to such problems between neighbouring to overcome
i like the spanish foreign policy here agree emphatically prices
spain has the historic difficult understanding between europe and africa and between spain and morocco the excellent way improve
beginning so years had i when still journalist the honour the the celebration the the   the the then king the morocco king  part to take
i i the therefore the close seen and the was impressive to to see how the spanish king the to peace was has together with the moroccan king in a open car by the streets drove where the more than a million people had gathered
that called the i pictures from our history and from my childhood the  adenauer and charles the de among when just such  by few german cities to clear to make that the problems between germany and france were overcome and that they together the core the the european europe would forms
as can spain and morocco the core the the integration in the mediterranean be
i think that spain and morocco a large achievement have made by to avoid what many for inevitably the namely the  or  the clash between different cultures
spain is gradually a tremendous  to role just if portugal moreover the seems i therefore the important the  also in that the to see
we are fully solidarity with the spanish and portuguese fishermen
the is here not to a  local issue the is here to european fishermen for who we us must working also if this issue us perhaps not directly affects
we must also very clear for view the that with particularly the relations between the european union and the  the the borders the the eu must be promoted to the countries am i africa turkey and russia countries the a bridge forms to other continents and cultures the the borders the the european union
we must the economic and political links with morocco therefore as soon possible because and same the european interests in the fisheries defend
i support therefore everything what here on the enforceable the the agreement is said
i like however clear the  covert vote the also in this debate to hear was because the the relations with our neighbours not the good is and because also the  this not the might is
we must us critical and open up but the moroccans also clear make that we addition the protecting the our own interests very many important to in a strong and sustainable partnership with morocco and in the stabilisation the morocco within the mediterranean
if the us manage morocco a european protection to give than will morocco also a beginning make with something that already earlier had must done the will than namely the issue the the natural resources with us discuss the common resources are and not longer privileges to the ships from third countries
mr the president on three days be the negotiations opened and than will we know or the consultation still in the its the or to full develop is has or the with other words sufficient  is in that last case need we us not ensure more to make and can the involved parties the european union and morocco the find to to diluted and agreements the the community deplete in the opportunity must to their activities in the involved waters to resume
if spanish and from member come i here the for the right the thousands from and spanish families to their income to retain and to defend and this the support the this parliament in to to the existence the their activity depends since almost a year the a sides thread
i like however also a appeal do the the healthy sense the the kingdom morocco that constantly the the european union and the parliament genuine to understanding and support to seek for the solution the the economic social and political problems which the to camps has i would morocco than also want ask the necessary flexibility the the day to to and in all seriousness that to work the the drafting the a good agreement which both parties the can find
mr the president the agriculture the immigration the this area have we moreover yesterday still a new line for support the morocco adopted the industry and the economy make part from the the whole the mutual relations that morocco and the european union with other maintain
the has not sense the fishing of from to the especially this in the agreement with morocco is the that we not only aspect the our interests outside one should let that would because extremely consequences have for the impetus which the european union the integral development the this country like and can promote
also the moroccans must this message good to understand
mr the president ladies and gentlemen the supplement would i only still want say that there course agreements are made between the two parties on the timetable the the negotiations and that morocco many months need has had to are fiveyear for to prepare
but since the mr fischler the may on a visit has the the  are the negotiations in a your has the july have the directorsgeneral fisheries other about in  the and september is there a sitting taken in brussels and the october has the mr fischler a meeting had with the prime and with his royal  mohamed vi the morocco
the the discussions has the mr fischler moreover report done the the commission and he has the indicated that he there a positive feeling the had was
that would that can apparent that the negotiations the the october the start will to in a constructive atmosphere will has
therefore address the commission the in its work the a new partnership that both parties to benefit can serve the must one at to are the the integral development the the fishing the morocco the fleet the  the  industry and research and hand fishing by the european fishermen possible to make
the seems i than also sensible the results the the sitting the october the to wait
course will the mr fischler the parliament  the the informed to the the results as you all hope i that the negotiations in a constructive atmosphere will has and can into in a successful cooperation between morocco and the european union
what the measures the the taken will must be if a agreement social on based the commission the still but you has the understand that we good hope have that during the negotiations next monday a decisive step forward the will can be the is than also premature to on the measures now in debate to act
to far the answers the the mr fischler in my place had can give i will the mr fischler certainly the the informed to the all by you in the debate made comments
mr the president i thank our friends and hope that they carefully to this vote will listen i mean the namely very seriously also already seems that the the first face perhaps not as
i understand the problems the the spanish and portuguese fishermen very good the inexplicably fishermen have same problems
few days ago i i however heard that a moroccan fish in the mediterranean sea a spanish fish is encountered and him has said in are own language course i i heard that the mr fatuzzo the also for a  commitment
this am i welcome that but i i still a other wish i am a moroccan fish and i like like by a moroccan fisherman be imprisoned and not by a spanish fisherman
therefore i i a trade up
the other fish the spanish says this i like like by a moroccan fisherman be imprisoned and not by a spanish
speaker the by the president cut
mr fatuzzo the rules provides in a minute time and the rule applies for all members
despite you thank for this particularly interesting contribution
rights the teachers
the the item is the oral question b the mrs palacio vallelersundi behalf the commission legal affairs and internal market the the commission on the rights the teachers compliance the the legislation
the mr wieland the mrs palacio vallelersundi replaces the during five minutes the floor
mr the president the president the the commission legal affairs and internal market mrs palacio vallelersundi is unfortunately suddenly prevented and has i asked behalf our commission statement to take
i had therefore but little time to i this for to prepare
where is the to
fact is the here not to teachers
many will perhaps also say that this issue any many to detailed and complicated is
the is therefore fact not to teachers but to a example that clear makes how the specific with the europe the the citizens is the
the is to a matter the in for the first the the court the justice before was made
a history the almost twelve year has took and both witness the bureaucratic   and  the hope and personal difficulties the  for the involved and the objective defence the old rights the citizens the only but their good right wanted to
the is to man and horse to mention as that as about is to the proceedings the the european citizens  and  against the university the venice still a proceedings the same  against the university the venice and the matter the european citizens david  against the university the verona
the court the justice has a clear position welcome
the has this citizens in three different judgements right given for the first judgement were the involved if teacher the a italian university appointed and the thrust the the statements is clearly
the rights the the involved people the free movement if worker and their right to not to be against the on the nationality were violated because italy has failed the lecturers same conditions and same security on their the to offer if italian citizens with a similar  the a italian university
after the first judgement is there unfortunately nothing changed
the was that the legislative the the result the the judgement in were implemented still always not sufficient were to the rights the lecturers with a official appointment fully to protect
end took even the ombudsman the for this citizens the
right have and right to are however two different things
the commission legal affairs and internal market has a clear position on this matter formulated and has the the the on the this in their rights  european citizens supported
now are there today only amendments tabled the i to the said from to express somewhat irritate
i like two examples mention the amendments which the the ninehour the tried the position the the parliament to improve or in a only case even whole to change the original by the legal commission proposed text the recital h reads whereas that the involved citizens the the union already this years have must suffering under lose stress and concern in longterm and repeated processes struggle are with hundreds cases in a period the twelve year and frustrated are in their reasonable fails to their appeal with proper opportunities the  from to exercise
now is there a amendment tabled amendment which a few words from the original text are removed and a like the added which the importance not only the weakened but almost the versa
the text would than if follows task whereas that the involved citizens the the union in longterm and repeated processes struggle are with hundreds cases in a period the twelve year and frustrated are in their reasonable fails
that makes not only in the german a clear difference
what i however many more think is that now in amendment the said whereas that the italian government declared the on the its law which the principles the the treaty fully be applied the its obligations the regard the the lettori to have met
from the the fact that the legal commission this not has said would we here say that the legal basis in the italian right with the principles the the treaty corresponds while the court exactly the opposite has said
i think that a dubious the the affairs
if the the opinion is that this practices legal by the unacceptable can and political desirable are than must the if legislator the basis change when the however this parliament like use to a position to measures than can i only but say that the ppe this not the that will do
mr the president gentlemen members the commission and the most other european institutions are good the the informed the the dispute on the legal the foreign teachers the linked are the italian universities
this matter the already more than ten year and thanks the intervention the the european institutions in the particularly the commission is there only improvement in in the situation the this lecturers
you know that this a extremely complex matter is the approximately staff the more than italian universities the
during the last ten year has the commission the active used to a solution to find for this issue the the the with the by the treaty guaranteed free movement the workers
as you has stressed is there by the european court the justice in luxembourg already three a judgement done in this issue the this at is there again a matter before the the court and the that the that the commission action remains take to change to to in the situation
the commission has in the particularly steps taken to the the the statements the the court the justice in and in the  alleging that the by the italian law down limited  discriminatory was
the commission has time a procedure of violation the the community before made but the matter is in were after in italy a law was adopted which the law in agreement were the with the judgement the the court
later have the foreign teachers a number demands the table the on their acquired rights and to the of has the commission a new procedure of violation the the community before made with if argument that the acquired rights the the lecturers the a number italian universities not sufficient guaranteed were
the commission has all possible resources used to this matter good to let every
as have the services the the commission hundreds documents gathered with data on specific cases the different universities
we have length  with the involved parties and us enormous effort to from the large started relevant and  documents the texts to explain the convincing proof that the lettori time actually against are by a number italian universities and that there not account taken is with acquired financial rights if salaries and their
in july is this matter the initiative the the commission presented the the court the justice
now waiting the commission the believe the the court in this new procedure the
the lecturers have time not only out the the lack the protection the acquired rights but also their disappointment expressed on the new system that in in the italian law is down
they were the opinion that the italian authorities them had must organise the the category the university teachers staff or if for them a special  within the category the teachers staff had must create
to the opinion the the foreign lecturers follows this right directly continue from the right the workers the free to they within the borders the the union
the this point was the commission the however with the lecturers not agree
in our view offers the free movement the european citizens protection against forms the discrimination the resulting from the national legal the the member
the citizens can there however not right the a special legal status the sense
any member is the full responsible rules the to to the the legal the the they within the national regulate
the community legislation offers not subjective to italy to prevent the provisions on the legal the the then lettori to change and we can therefore also not prevent that this lecturers exactly be if linguistic specialists with partly other rights and duties
to our opinion can the national legal in any member amended and reformed be as in italy therefore is happened the regard the the university staff without intervention the the commission as any citizens the europe free access has to all professional
and any citizens can in italy a fixed appointment acquire in the education by part to take the the this appropriate 
mr the president i like the mr programmes only a recital present
if the to a legal problem is let we the than with legal resources solve with a judgement the the court who must can in appeal to and who this in eligible is will right be done
if the to a political problem is and therefore the the parliament the agree are sorry the i that this issue programmes perhaps not as carefully be tackled if would must
i i many appreciation for the position the the commission and if parliament must we our attention there certainly good cross
i am here not to my government to defend the is namely not my government i represent a opposition but i like try the terms the the issue to clarify
we attach there very the that all european citizens in all member same rights have but that like say that also their duties in all states same are
the european citizens should not the what way than also in a another than the own country easier access to to a appeal without the examination and obligations the for the citizens the that country in this case italy apply
the the organisation the the education in the european union is the subsidiarity the application what like say that there different organisation are
in the italian system the someone not university teacher   this is a allow examination for need
unless therefore the systems be harmonised and we hope that that not happening is the in fight with the subsidiarity to something for discrimination from to make what probably simply amounts the questions to a privilege
i repeat everyone must same rights have but also same obligations
as not than can this problem that a political problem is and not legal problem in other countries the the european union back where the education and the university career otherwise are sensitive
i moon you therefore to caution
mr the president i take the floor to expression to give the my concern on this injustice which we have heard a injustice that as we also have heard already year expressions
to the of are but as two or three cases held but the situation take still always continue
why are we therefore today again back to this injustice here in the parliament to discuss
because we there not in are managed the issue the to solve
we must ensure the this matter continue give until they is resolved
which there this injustice
the mr wieland an there the attention the when he spoke behalf the commission legal affairs
the is is that two people the both same work do a different salary to and different conditions enjoy
if we really believe in the common market and the free movement the people than would this not should done
i am the not agree with my mr the mr  the earlier the floor has held
he had the agreed that this people to a privileged position would to
they questions not to a privileged position they questions only to same conditions
as they not same to if their mr programmes in italy will this issue continue play
i i good listened to what the mr busquin behalf the commission has said
according some the the commission characterised by a  the hypocrisy
others to still further and say that the commission to hypocrisy they
myself like far to to to to that the commission a light given the hypocrisy spreading
if the the commission really seriousness would are with the solve the this problem than would the years ago already are resolved
perhaps are we the agreed agree that the previous commission under the mr santer not the best was and therefore is they also 
but we the this commission in the monitoring the president the this commission is the this issue and the facts the full aware but there is still nothing taken to the problem the to solve
the is the us to to questions why this not the case is
that is the reason why this parliament today again on this subject debated and there the attention the drawing namely to the back to play to the commission and to say concern that the the resolved
mr the president politicians have often the thankless task the electorate clear to must make that there for a the problem not no there how sincerely their displeasure also is and how legitimate a no also would are
sometimes have they the still  task to must admit that the because the limited remedy or because the obstacles the in the right itself are the for the citizens difficult will are to are right to to
the worst think i to must warn that a positive judgement the the court perhaps from purely comfort words will there and for the life the the person in issue not difference the importance will make
fortunately is this in a democratic society rarely for
that is where a rule for the
no can itself over the law to to what he is or does
the american lawyer   has us that out that the failure the a system under more to due is the the fact that law and legislation one and implementation of hand not the other with
the last eleven year are there three judgements the the european court the justice the favour the the lettori been
the september the this year pointed the european ombudsman a demand the them to and is in a number individual cases a judgement confirmed by italian courts
i am i there very the the aware that the circumstances for both parties not easy are been
but if we in this parliament important attach the the rule must we ensure ensure that this the maintained
if we in this parliament sincerely believe in a europe the the citizens must we to to a such rule
as said is this the third time that this issue in the form the a resolution in the parliament the the item the the
i hope and am that this in the future never more need will are or the must are to all to thank the to have contributed that there now action is taken
since the friday is are there little members in the parliament present there must however to be said that this a issue is the all parties and the whole union affects
members the the commission legal affairs and internal market from the whole union and the all parties are met to that to point that the sense is to talk on rights and to favour for a charter the rights when in  which people their rights be denied not effective measures be taken to this rights to recognise and to to apply to this problem is the here
i was the example unfortunately to to see that in one the the amendments not only pointed was that there a matter before was made the the ombudsman but also that this the burden in the right had the
this is the important since the commission according the ombudsman wrong had action by the lettori not to inform on the fact that there  on a important article were exchange the article which the commission the documents  is now precisely where commissioner busquin the on had
where the to is is that the lettori claim make the the right to working to continue if teacher and not if something otherwise
no can deny that the republic italy in or the any another time fully in its right was when they know was in the future not people more to will appointed if lettori but a new type appointment to will create
everyone the in the future  can this be informed but the rights the are maintained by the court can later not be any
i can the commission inform that i hope that they will respond the the next point in the judgement the the court the the the that the in fight is with article member the the treaty to up the the european economic community when the on the the legislation the a member the duration the agreements the lecturers for foreign languages in all cases the limited to one year with possibility to extension if for other lecturers this reduction not applies
if this indeed the case is than have the people whose representatives today the the gallery are right the recognition if teacher the a italian university with same  if lecturers the for the duration the ten year the the university are appointed
we say not that they italian official would must be but to that italy are legislation in agreement would must to with the decision the the court and this lecturers if such would must recognise
president there is clear something wrong with the  the foreign  in italy if they only a temporary appointment to if technical administrative employee
they have than for same work on a bad legal and a lower pay than their colleagues with the italian nationality
that is already earlier the by the court the justice and the ombudsman
the important is or the here is to a unfortunate coincidence or to a fully choice for sustainable enforcement the this difference
i take the that the italian  already fully the the informed are the the criticism but i me the impression that they the not be convinced the the need to the future otherwise to do
also if favour the national autonomy and the right the diversity voice i in with the resolution because never must be against the on the nationality
can acceptance the the proposed resolution something the the situation change or can the european union this end nothing against do
the italy punished with a fine
continue we powerless complain or to again other member italian teachers an
chance departure i afternoon to italy a country where i many the connection to college to give on the benefits the mediterranean food the with so success to all countries the the world the exported therefore think i the more to  to in this intervention the italian government and its legislation the this area to must criticise
a number the my british electorate the in italy want who and college give are however less  than i today
in have foreign lecturers the in italy worked a proceedings won for the european court the justice that certain that the duration the their contracts not if be limited to six year
after the italian universities had responded by to to that they the on the the judgement not without more compulsory were to contracts for indefinite duration the to offer was in a second judgement the the court explicitly the that the duration the the contracts not if be down
in response this  the universities the  the foreign lecturers to the the preliminary staff which they not more the status the university teacher had
this  lettori as they be mentioned  their employer for the italian high council the their demand  and task by to immediately restoration the their 
the universities established the judgement addition the the and  the involved the rights which lecturers the who including the right the sixmonthly pattern the within the italian scientific education very pure are
in their kafkaesque action were the universities even far that they the names the the involved  the their internal  the doors and their websites
in the europe the this time is this unacceptable
some the you will the the informed are the my support for the right the male descendants the the in exile live italian royal family to back to times to their country
they the under a  article the the italian constitution which all male descendants the the royal family the right the denied to the the italian territory to really i i is this in fight with the treaty the amsterdam
the left and liberal groups in this parliament have disgusting enough  to the two  the access to the court the justice to deny although there the short term a judgement the the court for the rights the the human in strasbourg the expect
governments must understand that when they treaties sign they or this if sovereign the must withdraw or the if rule must the the the provisions that
the italian government the there from left parties the the too the merit the the european laws rights and treaties the heaven in prices must what this two issues the quickly measures take if they not like that the  to the italy to the european legislation to maintain lead to cynical comments in other member
to far has the european commission the not prepared shown to to to see the the compliance the the treaties as the number disadvantaged people low is
my point on the royal family is by the liberal rapporteur on human the this parliament even portrayed if strange and commonplace
i think that this affairs directly are the the principles the the freedom as the resulting from the european legislation in the particularly the freedom the movement the this principles can not be from
residents the the european union should not be against where they also from to and where they also across to within the union
this issues are the crucial important for the enforcement the the freedom within europe to my opinion be the interests the italy the not few way damaged by the royal family or by foreign lecturers
mr the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen i think the debate on this issue the not only italy the very interesting and important
in recital c the the resolution refer we to three legal statements the content that the rights the the involved the the free movement the workers and their right to not to be against the on the their nationality by the negligence the italy be violated if that also still agree by the ombudsman and by many speakers in this debate the confirmed than the the argument the a the the previous speakers the said that the at violation with the subsidiarity can be motivated not abandoned
if the european court the justice establish that the european right is violated than can this not the subsidiarity  be the
in the second place is this the certainly a political debate because the a violation the the right the
the legal status the the treaties can not against the political be off in this respect have we if parliament precisely the duty a political debate on the violation the the right to the
i think that here the saying direction that who itself not seriously the also by others not seriously the taken
when the court the justice the three on a matter has expressed and the country in issue are behaviour still always not change than must we intervene and this ensure the give
we have here still but few days ago on the charter the the fundamental discussed
is the enforcement the eu right not the first right which any member the must to the
is the promotion the the rule not the moral basis the the european community
this two things can not against other be off
course is the education still under the subsidiarity but from under the the treaties apply the free movement the workers and the policies for us all despite as we and i certainly because i come from a very federal country the subsidiarity if yardstick for the cooperation within the european union and effort we us in to the competences between the different levels in europe as quickly possible accordance the subsidiarity to regulate
the behaviour the italy in this issue is in fight with the objectives the the community and with our wish the mobility and the flexibility the workers to promote
the cultural diversity the we if a essential accompany the europe as that especially from our multilingual
who the cultural diversity defends must there everything the do to the large diversity the languages to retain and ensure to ensure that we they all can learn
we are favour the a internal market with a economic nature
also if member the the commission culture youth education media and sport say i however the economic internal market has a internal market for education need
as also the debate the today late see there there the this internal market still many obstacles the the not to this case to
we must everything in the work to to the obstacles as quickly possible from the way to overcome
mr the president i believe that all speakers a sensible contribution have made the this debate
nevertheless believe i just already answer to have given the a number questions the now the are
i would there again the want point that the factor time always a role plays the this type procedures and that we here speak on facts the ten year ago the is here to a matter with different aspects the all in eligible taken must to be
to the the the fact that the italian system not  with the statements the the european court the justice in the  has the commission time the the court a procedure of violation the the community before made this matter is in however were the the at that in italy a law the force was the decided in abolition the the offending provisions
then is in in italy a new law adopted which the discriminatory elements not more frustrated
that is one aspect the the matter second aspect the problem the the acquired rights
the this point have we the matter to the the soil investigated as i earlier already i indicated and the commission has in july again a process of violation the the community against italy seat
we are now than also in pending the a new judgement the the european court the justice on this second aspect
there are here therefore actually two affairs in the affected the i not whole different like mention but the the a somewhat different way have
the is than also good a distinction to make between this two affairs
in the first place is the to the free access the any european citizens to all professional the is clear that today the day any european citizens in italy a fixed appointment can acquire in the education by part to take the the this appropriate mentioned for teachers staff
the this point is there the discrimination not there more
we must us therefore up the the situation as the in the past was because the was the certainly there the discrimination
in this respect has the commission its work done by procedures before to make the the european court the justice and further has the italian authorities its laws amended
in the second place plays here the issue the the acquired rights the is course still not resolved
the this at is there again a matter of violation the the community before the the court the justice and we hope that the court in this matter as soon possible a judgement will do
the debate is closed
we to now on to the vote
resolution b on the rights the language enforcement the the rule
after the vote on recital h
mr the president i like the proposals to in this amendment between government and declared the words the not presented way in to add
i i there not objection against when we that be out that the italian government something declared but we must the words the not presented way add or the amendment reject especially this the commissioner disgusting enough has let will that he perhaps believe importance the the statement
mr the president i am not movement for the italian government and also not for the italian courts the many pensioners to a unfair pension have condemned in this case i i however against voted because i the not agree am with the judgements the the court the justice
the real problem is that we a  someone the very good english know and in a italian university  from is to what the english terms are for  operation  etc not same rights and same status can their if those the medicine teaching
president would you the let deal by someone the excellent the the informed is the  terms in the italian english french and german or by a 
mr the president i i personally many understanding for the problems the the teachers in italy the not on the italian nationality have
if leukaemia the a very small  am i a large  the the free movement the workers and selfemployed as the the freedom the establishment
if former  the the focusing i i already more than year the the  to to protest against all forms the discrimination the on the gender or nationality
the free movement the workers must however not to result have that workers in their own country against be
i am itself from from a country which the population for more than from  there the the here foreign residents and  therefore i know which i am
in my country must the teachers for the continue education a very strict very been allow examination make
the is completely unacceptable from principle view mean i that people in their own country against be because the foreigners easier the made access to obtain to certain functions
nevertheless hope i that us debate to will can contribute that there quickly a fair solution found the for the issue the the teachers in italy
but i must the say that we the agenda the the friday well would can complement if we us here would deal with all other similar cases the discrimination especially the cases the discrimination the on the gender
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president the am i that the amendments the the group are rejected and that i therefore for this report could vote i must however question places the a comment the the mr busquin
he said that everyone the the a italian university working must participate the same examination if which italian lecturers be subject
i see not in why that the case would are
we be considered diplomas programmes in very europe mutual to recognise so you in you own country a diplomas can achieve and then to a another country can to
this is the idea behind the speech the the mr busquin the in doubt must be drawn the is unfortunately that he the parliament now has leave
that was not point the item mr purvis
the mr busquin is unfortunately already left
i council you the directly contact with him the to take
adjournment the the session
i declare the session the the european parliament to are cut i wish you a good weekend
the sitting the to at closed
resumption the the session
i declare the session the the european parliament the the friday october was cut to are resumed
statement the the president
mrs the president i am you particularly grateful for your words the sympathy and some after this terrible disaster the were mainly young the are expected in the train were put
they inclusion the the a  day the a claw day a tragic death a terrible death was them
i know not or still someone otherwise on this disaster like speak but i like you in any case behalf many members and certainly behalf my group and my delegation thank
mrs the president after your clear and sensitive words like i notice that we the opinion are that we this subject not more in the urgent need to deal
i hope that everyone this understanding for has
mrs the president behalf my delegation like i my special thank express for your words the sympathy the you after the disaster the the kitzsteinhorn behalf the european parliament has at to  klestil chancellor schüssel and the also to the whole austrian people
i am also grateful because you the flag  has let hoist
all together feel we the shocked and the sadness we parts this suffering with the those
we want us express sympathy with them express the death is large
we are the friends with blend mouths that has the large austrian closer  maria  agree written
this  in a  the if particularly safe was as and the the passengers to one the the most groundwater in the austrian alps maintaining governed already our mind our willingness to the pain and the sadness with other to parts the for us all to comfort
therefore seems the i appropriate that we a minute the silence have devoted the the victims the not only from my country were but also from many other countries in europe and outside also i am the opinion that a resolution this not sense would are
approval the the minutes the the previous sitting
the minutes the the sitting the friday october are distributed
not any
mrs the president in the minutes the october the report made the our decision to a resolution the to take on the italian lettori and we were very grateful that the house this with as such large majority 
i think that the members the the parliament must know that the president the the association the lettori meantime previous week in are  a visit has been the the  the was control or he perhaps not the plan was a violent demonstration to organise against the minister the education
that be you however difficult a positive response mention the the by us adopted resolution
the minutes be approved
regulation the the work
the the item is the final agenda as the by the conference the presidents the thursday november is the accordance article the the rules
a meetings the to and with november monday
the regard the the report the the mr ceyhun behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs i i two ask received a request the the group the the european social to the report back to refer to the commission and a request the the group the calls free alliance to the report from to to to a next partsession
i give the floor the the mr ceyhun the clearly if rapporteur and behalf the group the the european social
mrs the president i like also behalf my group notice that the fact sensible would are to this report the basis the article the the rules back to refer to the competent commission i i namely just a report prepared but then i i heard that the council a number plans for this subject has
we have that not the time to hear been and therefore would the more are to to wait the the legislation we make better work if we the problem only than in the parliament deal
therefore i i for to the now not to deal but the back to refer to the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs this can this issue certainly good be regulated
the is therefore very clear the rapporteur recommending committee to the commission the
he spoke also behalf the group the the european social the the request has tabled
wishes someone on this request to committee to the commission to speak
mrs the president the report the mr ceyhun is very important and also we have heard that the council few new plans with the to this subject has
i support the proposal the the mr ceyhun and i would very grateful are if the council clear would can make or he really the plan is a new proposal on to do
you wishes therefore the certainly the committee to the commission
like someone the express against this request
mrs the president the council was according i already long time that we this subject disability
the seems i from institutional view the z such least eager that the council the the end has decided a another position in to take and us of to the last at in ignorance has left so someone the established would feel to committee to questions
we have us work done and i think that the completed must be irrespective the position the the council
we are not followmyleader  the the council we have our institutional autonomy and i think therefore that this committee completely unnecessary is
mrs the president i question the floor for a point the item not on the agenda but on the vote
i i for that we wednesday to at if first on the oral questions on the euromediterranean conference vote as you know the the conference same afternoon to at in marseilles opened
because the vote many time in up will take and also cut will be by the formal sitting with president kostunica and some the us must leave to the the opening the the conference in marseilles present to can are would we if first can vote on the oral questions and then on all other reports
that would easier are the is there therefore only to the vote to the to to
mrs the president gentlemen colleagues our group take this issue as important that the urgent there according us not the right place for is
we are the opinion that we the this events a oral question the the council and the the commission must turn we want the question good formulate so the council and the commission agreed can speak
the urgent seems us not the right at to this subject to deal therefore to we for to the the the agenda the to to
thank you the mr poettering
like still someone the express for this request
the mr poettering spoke behalf the group the request the subject to delete
we parts than also fully their moreover logical concern therefore would i as the president the my group already said has the socialist group want proposals agree agreement to to this subject the a serious and rigorous way to deal in the form the a oral question the the council and the the commission
if that however not the intention the the those the the resolution if are and the because lack the experience a home issue in this parliament would want discuss than does the group the the european party course not that the this game i am there moreover certainly the that the authors the the resolution the not have let lead by a lack the unscrupulously but that the here to a internal issue is is the last weekend even by the spokesman the the socialists in the spanish second chamber recognised
mrs the president my group has carefully to this proposal listened
to the the what the mr galeote said has must i say that the here not to a home issue is the is a matter which the commission powers has and in the answer the the question the mr aparicio on this issue has the commission this confirmed
in that answer was also reference made the the lack the information and difficulties because the british government we have the therefore at not on a internal matter but on the presence the a submarine with fault
the fault has the royal navy do decisions plenty to let ensure in british ports the the therefore a matter the the on the the treaties with including the the euratom under the competence the the commission is
many citizens can this affected be or are that already while there not only  there in that area is the not only to spanish because the the costa del  who hundreds citizens from the member addition many foreigners from countries outside the union
therefore believe we that this subject a individual treatment deserves
if the proposal the the european party support means for the deal the this question in the next plenary sitting than would we agree can agree is the proposal other a  than are we there against
i would therefore the ppe to a formal commitment want questions together with us to vote for the treatment the this subject if oral question the the commission and the the council during the next partsession
mr barón barón i like there certainly the are that i you good understand
i i a proposal the the group to this point from the urgent to delete that just oral is explained by the mr poettering and the mr galeote
if i you good i understand mr  barón i i the idea that you the with the the justification
you you ensure this point to delete
mrs the president my group would there for are the question in the agenda the december the to take
we to however not agreement with postponement the this subject to fullness by the this week to delete
yes course but let we say that we the formally given from the urgent delete
but we are the agreed agree the the the agenda to to as you said
true that mr poettering
mrs the president the is idly but very enlightening to the the spanish minister the home affairs the mr said said to know that the not sense has to talk with the basque nationalists even if there in the future a new ceasefire would to
this statement does clear not with the position the our spanish mr programmes here in this parliament the to that in the kingdom spain any political party are ideas what that also should are can defend with only one principle not violence
can the parliament this refusal to a dialogue the to to support
can this parliament the door to political solutions the
can this parliament the door the to a democratic future for basque in europe
i would like want that the points the item really points the item are and i would you grateful are if you to to start as that moreover for is by the rules the article the the rules the which this point the item based is
mrs the president i like your attention draw the a written statement the mr ebner
he the for the directive as to change that there more account the taken with the subsidiarity
i like you and all colleagues ensure warn that the statement the presented if would they positive are for birds and the interests the the birds would defend i can you however tell that that not as is they will the position the the migratory in the european union precisely weaken
i question you all in any case good to aware what you signs if you the petition signs
i i fully behind the thrust the the letter the mr  mr on this subject has written and the the colleagues has sent not misleading advertising for the written statement
mrs the president only time ago have we in this parliament about on the issue the the sanctions against iraq
i am particularly pleased that the british liberals have decided to the to to to a revision the the sanctions
two weeks ago am i to iraq very through the turkish airspace to baghdad for a humanitarian mission
in the six months since my previous visit is the situation still further worse
according unicef die there any month children
the commission would this issue here in this parliament must to discuss
the conflict in the central east is the not few way the this children to to count
the commission has slavishly the bases position adopted while the united states the british and the turks the bombing in the south the iraq continue
mrs the president i like like that you the commission request to a statement the to to on the issue the the sanctions
mrs the president a point the item
i had indicated the floor to want to before you the discussion on the agenda would conclude
must i you ask to this week a statement the the commission to discuss on the decision the the british authorities to a discriminatory tax in to to for  strike
i  you or the parliament remind to remind that this fully counter against the treaties the a international access to the internal market guarantee
the goes also in against directive ec the rules that and i quote the courage and insuring be on without direct or indirect discrimination the on the the nationality the the  or the the origin or the destination the the vehicle
this has a particularly adverse impact the the irish trade
cent the the irish truck programmes the the irish strike must to the united kingdom or through the british  to europe
i would here like a statement the the commission on hear and a appeal want do the the commission use to make the its powers to the freedoms the the internal market to maintain and to to to see the compliance the directive ec where i just to referred
before the british authorities the proposed changes the implement to must we here with urgency a debate on to and must the commission very clear say what the law procedural the this area
mrs doyle i i you what more time whether because your comment not point the item was
they was in the framework the the agenda and the sorry i very that i there not on warned am
i think that the commission your request good understand has commissioner vitorino confirms i that
there will a positive result the be given
mrs the president with the to the operated the the parliament and the safety the the members like i the next say during the previous partsession the on to exactly to are is the mr mario mantovani member the the ppe and mr the forza italia  the the downstairs and has he are  down when he with are founders a taxi the the parliament wanted take
he is has to the vote the  then is are footing in the  the and now can he for days not more the our work participate
if representative the pensioners would i the if a good sign the can summarise that there disabled are that means because a additional pensioner but the the other on importance i the the safety the the members
my question the you is therefore when there lifts or  will be sit so we after our work safe the car can take
mrs the president i like the parliament like inform on a worrying initiative that the regional government the  in italy the previous week taken has
this has namely a commission set for the control the history in the schools
the commission must control in what this paper by marxism positions worthless become are as the neofascists the in  the government forms say
this make tell however only but the history the italy the the second war the nazism and the fascism with if point course that the values which the opposition and the mammon struggle have not the same plan are if the ideas the hitler and mussolini
this is a serious matter the can lead to the imports the censorship in italy the this at only the paper but who know soon also the another 
since the socalled liberal parties also in europe still more cooperation seek with by xenophobic racist and authoritarian ideas refuge movements is this not only dangerous for italy but also a signal for very europe
i request the mr programmes a petition to signs the i now late performance and the also by other european intellectuals is signed
mutual assistance
the the item is the joint debate on the next reports
a the the mr marinho behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the french republic with the view the the adoption the a framework the the council on the laundering the money the identification detection freeze adopted and common the resources and the the proceeds the crime c cns
a the mrs karamanou behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the portuguese republic with the view the the adoption the a act the the council on drafting the on the article member the the agreement to up the a european police convention the a protocol to amendment the article and the annex the the agreement c cns
a the mrs roure behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the french republic with the view the the adoption the a agreement on the improvement the the mutual assistance in criminal in the particularly the the area the the fight the the organised crime the laundering the the yield the crime and the financial crime c cns
mrs the president the fight against the financial crime and with particularly the fight the the laundering the money is in the sitting the today the several agenda the mentioned that is the impact the the political important that the union importance the legal to the area the freedom safety and justice to achieve
after the creation the the internal market and the the by way liberalisation the the capital and the financial services makes the union now work the the fight against the laundering the money
the the complex crime the the laundering is a another  ex which the the illegal obtained use in the normal regular economy wishes to recycling
the laundering the money is the  the the international crime the international crime follows continue from the globalisation the the economy and the gradual liberalisation the the trade and as in the conclusions the tampere the is the international crime the core the the organised crime
the money that the like laundering is often from the drug and now there there broad agreement on the fact that the laundering fight must be by the illegal yield the the  in up to take
if the not time idly the the illegal yield later the something the the a do enrichment only by international cooperation can this fight effective are and that means for the union judicial cooperation between all member the the fight the the international crime
in this report the emphatically positive responded the the measures the the french presidency proposed just as the portuguese presidency earlier this year is the current presidency by with initiatives for the mutual adaptation the the legislation the basis the the results the the european council the tampere and the implementation the the treaty the amsterdam
further should we course both the large commitment the the commission the this area if the clarify the spirit the commissioner antónio vitorino not forget
the framework that i in my report constitute compulsory the member a common result to achieve while in the reports the mrs karamanou and mrs roure respectively the enlargement the the  the europol to the laundering the money and the improvement the the mutual assistance by a agreement the mentioned to the three initiatives the we today deal are in the sense than also between coherent
mrs the president we are than also the the good way to a broad legal framework that effective enough is to the are least this crime to can connect course am i in my report support from for the most objectives the the framework
the the laid proposals are that at the member in the to to the yield the the  to confiscate same be the member to compulsory crime which the laundering the money in the affected is to prosecute and to punish without use to can make the the reserved the the former legal
the old determination among the the criminals easy a game to play with the law and whole economies to control also support we the binding nature the the framework so the the one on the member compulsory are their legislation the to apply the the common result and same member the the other on subject are the the control the the court the justice
in the report be however also critical comments placed the the french proposal
why the only a part the the previous common action in legislation into and is there not directly elected for the into the the whole action in the framework as i i explained the the amendments and by the other nature the that common action to we now a  the weak and strong legislation and the the  the the common action consolidated
we are the there also not that agree that the  the and the confiscate the property limited must continue to the cases which there there is the a serious 
that would a enormous legal you content the the not few way to justify is a whole series crime would than not persecuted be and to that to prevent are the amendments and tabled
i like again my appreciation express for the initiatives the the french and the portuguese government taken have in the framework the the wider opportunities the the treaty the amsterdam however the certainly offers
let we honest are the commission has the wider opportunities very good know to use
the is unfortunately that this still not priority is the the reform the the treaties this the current igc fully in the smuggled is the the standards and strident the the member
but we believe that the citizens soon this new dimension the europe will know the to to they will a revision the the treaties enforceable the line with their were interests
we believe also that the revision actually will be achieved from name the freedom safety and justice
mrs the president if president the the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs will i the report the mrs karamanou present
unfortunately is mrs karamanou not in the to here evening present to are but i think the rightly that there on its report the discussed level after the just express excellent report the the mr marinho
the republic portugal has a avilés presented the amendments the article the the agreement to up the a european police europol
this portuguese initiative is intended to the powers the europol from to extend and a general framework to create for the powers the europol on the laundering the money
course is the fight the the laundering the money a the the most priorities the the union as rightly was indicated the the summit the tampere last year
if the in recital the that the laundering the money the core is the the organised crime with particularly the trade in drugs resources the as such large threat is for the health and the public safety can the not otherwise than the proposed measure support
statements must be followed by specific steps to the yield the criminal activities the to encourage to freeze in up to take and to confiscate
the proposed protocol would must be given if a necessary measure within a european strategy for police the the area the the laundering the money
but given the urgency the the problem objective the rapporteur there in the by its proposed amendment to to this protocol as quickly possible approved to to and that like according article member paragraph d the the treaty on the european union say as a majority the the member knowledge has given the their approval
the commission which i the honour i president to are has the report the mrs karamanou practical with unanimity the vote approved
although we the portuguese initiative the i welcome continue we however insist the a many wider revision the the convention with particularly the mechanisms the both the democratic responsibility the if the legal control the europol can assure
late i just in the briefly further the the two points like
on the democratic responsibility take i note the the fact that the this at article the the convention requires that the european parliament only the consulted on a annual
that is absolutely unacceptable and the parliament has in the recent past with particularly during the discuss the the reports nassauer and cederschiöld already a number times asked to amendment the the convention to a really democratic control the this service to guarantee
to if parliament a such democratic control to can exercise must europol just as example the ecb the ombudsman and other european institutions report produce on are activities during a annual exchange
the director the europol would for the competent committees the the parliament must before if the circumstances that require
also would the parliament represented must are in the council the administration the europol and that must can decide on the choice the the director the the service
this ask are in amendments and the the report the mrs karamanou
for what the the legal responsibility seems the us also unacceptable that possible disputes or conflicts between member or between europol and member not can be presented the the court the justice despite the provisions the article the the treaty which now precisely the referred to affairs the to make have with police and legal cooperation the crime
this contradiction does with democratic values with particularly on human and especially the the area the data
a such lack the legal control the europol is precisely also as dangerous because europol how longer how more responsibilities seems to to and this point is back to find in amendment the mrs karamanou
conclude can i say that the parliament the portuguese initiative the study and positive way has examined but that we dissatisfied are on the limited scope the the proposed revision the the convention
the the challenge the a international organised crime must the european parliament in the are the citizens the the union effective to represent and to the reason must we than also fully the the informed be taken the and involved be the the activities the programme programmes the efficiency the methods and the resources the europol
i am i very the aware the the fact that the parliament on this issue only consulted the
nevertheless do we a urgent appeal the the french presidency that the as decisive has used for the fight the the laundering the money to account to the with our demands
the build the a european area the freedom safety and justice can not in hands continue the a specialised service the only under control the the the national authorities
this is a important area for european integration and the european parliament the ready to to help the the policymaking the this area but must this than the to properly the involved be
rapporteur fr mrs the president the organised crime has the the last years better organised and is in extent has
we can the that the with particularly by the globalisation easier is become black money white to any and the persecution to us
according figures the the united nations so the extent the through  again in circulation take capital annual a amount the billion dollar
the laundering the money is a difficult the to encourage form the crime and the heavy crime nothing all opportunities the the by the different legislation is be
this criminal practices can therefore only effective be fight the basis the international police and judicial cooperation
the european level has the mutual assistance in criminal already led to the approval the various texts as the treaty the the council the europe the april and very recently the european agreement the may which our mr the mr di pietro moreover rapporteur was
what the the fight the laundering the money can still out be the the recently amended directive the the council the june which our mr the mr lehne rapporteur was
the initiative the the french presidency that we today deal the the improvement the various instruments the the the with the criminal cooperation and with particularly the the both general treaties the abovementioned are mentioned in the particularly the the area the the fight the the laundering the money
the proposed treaty improves the previous texts and the improvements are welcome
thanks article the the draft can the member not  or  more refuse by a appeal to do the the reserved the in article the the treaty the are the
to the into to facilitate must member according article appropriate measures take to the input and the safe each the data on the there the location and the movements the proceeds the offences to promote and according article must the member  provide
by article can the supplementary ask to assistance be extended and thanks article are tax exceptions not more acceptable if on for refusal the mutual assistance
on the whole taken deserve the measures in this draft our support
they the the the the wish the the european council the tampere to the fight the to made against the laundering the money that the core is the the organised crime and that all must be eradicated
i seemed the that there still the a few improvements for to to were and that is the subject the my report
article the the  the the bank and  the ask to mutual assistance
the seems i essential this  from to extend to asked and the provide the financial opinion by consultants and members the regulated legal professional the because their nature not the the professional are subject
hand be in article the the draft the motives for refusal the mutual assistance by the petitioned member limited that is a step forward
to to prevent that the mutual assistance the importance however the a area which a european judicial cooperation only sense is if the quickly to the is seems the i however desirable that the petitioned member a ceiling term the two months the whether to are answer express to make
in article the the member asked the national level integrated multidisciplinary teams in to to to the efficiency the the into to increase and exchange the information to promote
i i for a  between this multidisciplinary teams the to up
this butyrsky would the coordinating between the involved authorities the the member can facilitate and the choice and the application the the best methods can promote
this proposals aim only a as effective possible mutual assistance to achieve which we the head can offer the the challenges the the organised crime and especially the laundering the money
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen my task is relatively simple i can if rapporteur for opinion behalf the legal commission on the proposal the the portuguese presidency on the role the europol the the fight the the laundering the money only but say the is a good proposal
therefore have we but very very little amendments tabled
all european institutions and therefore also the parliament are the there in high extent on agree that we everything in the work must to what but possible and sense is and on have other speakers for i already the necessary said to the laundering the money the to tackle
now i however however the floor speaking on the fight the the laundering the money would i however what criticism want intensely
this criticism has fact at nothing to make with the subject that the discussion the namely the result the the political consultation in the council on the second directive on the fight the the laundering the money
the european parliament has the beginning the the tried to closely with the council together to work
i can only but say that what there end from the bus is has although a score kind the the council was but that the most amendments the we had tabled and where a majority majority the the members for had voted not are adopted
i can only but say that the the debt the the council is and not the the parliament if the idea the the fight the the laundering the money the the the
fact are the rules the used were however for the banks and the sector the the financial services adopted for the free professions although they this at not apply the was the council that a intensive second reading in the european parliament and end a conciliation the inevitably would be
the is finally not to the privileges the lawyers or other free professions
the is to fundamental
the is to not more and not less than the possibility for a citizens the legal opinion like obtain or the aid the a court like invoked to a lawyer to take the he confidence without that the immediately the the prosecutor the justice must  what he to hear has been
that the also in the charter the the fundamental
that is a right the must not the hand be has
that applies for all forms the legal opinion
therefore am i very grateful for the text the our commission for the report roure has however the that namely clear that the traditional protection the this right must be guaranteed
i like however also very clear say that this protection course not applies when a lawyer same does if a bank or a financial adviser
the is to legal opinion to the representation for a court
this must the fundamental be guaranteed
i i already said that i this proposals therefore support same like i the council however already warn there is a hard fight on the common position on the second directive on the fight the the laundering the money
mrs the president this is i i a extremely important debate the to we because after how we item the affairs can to in own house
i like first the mr marinho thank for are work the fight the the economic crime must supported and with the most possible attention dealt be
this is mrs the president gentlemen mr programmes a extremely complicated issue the are we faced with one attempts to regularisation the from illegal activities obtained income a where labyrinth and hand a whole series other crime the precisely the source are the illegal income
i i are the current european societies fully in the over the the organised crime in what form than also
the economic crime and more specific the today the the item having issue forms probably the core the the organised crime including europe its is
the in the report the the mr marinho dealt initiative the the french presidency is very certainly the good on from but the effort the the mr marinho itself has taken with are insist the more rules is also very important
if we new with incapable want we in the fight the such crime must we the right instruments have and the best instrument is i i the improvement the the judicial cooperation
the the read the the  the the by the mr marinho tabled amendments was my attention drawn by a specific passage
the the that europe the economic level large progress has made and also the political level progress makes but as the in the justification there unfortunately still still fifteen internal borders are for judges  judgements and litigation in the general
i was by this sense to give because this is according i the 
there must indeed still many steps still many real steps be taken and this like also i the i a favour break to to can to to judicial cooperation the european level and to real fight the under other economic crime
gentlemen mr programmes a the the essential issues in the construction the the european area for safety freedom and justice is with particularly the judicial and police cooperation the to must lead that the area quickly efficient and specific the for the citizens
respect have our rapporteurs both on the protocol to amendment the the convention if on the improvement the the mutual assistance their light let seem
we can them only but congratulate with that work
but we are with particularly concerned on the enlargement the the powers the europol we support expressly and with urge that a effective mutual assistance necessary is but lacking same the excesses which europol the terms already in the bears
europol is namely up outside any parliamentary or legal control more in the general lacking we the democratic one the a europe that the states in the opacity atmosphere the the intergovernmental procedures want continue the which the obligations the duties and the control the from the general right resulting circumvent be
there suffers different vague aspects the europol the diplomatic immunity the its members the lack the a definition the the permitted resources and their borders opinions on the instance the dossiers on people the instance the dossiers the areas the be protected by international texts and  and the threat the the freedoms the given the risk the abuse and the political developments in some states today or tomorrow can the
if the european police if a gift from the heaven possible compounded is to will they everything in the work to to the fast the the european parliament to democratic control in to  given the current shortcomings in the structure and the lack the fundamental unity
the portuguese initiative the regard the the convention the the european parliament to the to to the safe way to choose through the arbitrary instance the dossiers on citizens the all areas the the private
the laundering the black money the terrorists and the weapon and  also the perpetrators prosecute and condemn yes course
but that the us not more guarantee the regard the the right the defence and the protection the the rights the the citizens
therefore favour we in our amendments for strengthening the this rights and this freedoms for adaptation the a instrument for respect for the right the defence and recognition the the competence the the court the justice
the is us not unknown that a article the the decision the the council the ministers that strange enough on the head is given the that europol rules or data on race religious or other convictions political views  or health in the  should be included
to we now therefore still longer therefore on the powers the europol while the democratic control the the stones  is removed
the democratic values the us in this chamber unite must us in our action and work lead so we the europe only a based and social european union make and not police and repressive european union
mr the president first like i the rapporteur the mr marinho the i congratulate
are analysis is i i absolutely shortterm and the the way the the we must follow the the real fight the the laundering the black or as certain people that mention eutrophic money
i like remind remind that fight the laundering fight means the the organised crime that like say the drug women and children and the still many more terrible crime the extremely consequences have for the society and even this say i not without any cynicism for the economy this the there now the aware is has that this money the monetary liquidity increase and the the economic policies often 
our rapporteur says and i am the fully with him agree that now we to what reason than also the borders have opened and therefore also for the organised crime we the forced are also the borders to open for the authorities for justice and police the this crime combat
course must we with the view this agreements make on common definitions the the understanding crime and must we look what methods the crime used only than can we because prevent that the crime the one country leave to are resort to take in the other country
the reasons this the not only the with the litigation as the mr marinho already said and i am the with him agree is communitisation the only way
he has completely right because the the way path we the way the the parliamentary and democratic control
even if we today everything would approve what the us tabled continue there still many serious issues unresolved
i mean this the next that there are currently in the european union member the foreign practices cannot or this i would almost say even currency from we they  foreign  etc
political europe political control would us possibly a solution can offer for such issues for the revision and the harmonisation therefore the the determination for this issues
this are however institutional changes need mr the president and the will probably also in nice not appear the opportunity to
i am welcome with this debate
the illegal sale the  and other criminal activities as behind make annual billions euro programmes the the the part in counterfeiting and that must than laundered be
the is our task to the proceeds the the organised crime the to encourage to back to freeze in up to take and to confiscate
we have here to make with criminals the not only means afraid to discovery to prevent
we life the footing the war with this people
the this type illegal profit counts a kind not
we have a fully coordinated approach need
crime know not borders
the law the proceeds from crime the by my government in ireland was introduced is with success use by us bureau that the concerns with from crime obtained assets to to prevent that people the the are the with criminal activities the results the their crime can them
end last year had the bureau the basis the the law properties and  in up taken the gentlemen the million euro and had the  are the eur the more than million euro
the cooperation between the eu and our  must than already growing are the scale which money the laundered and fraud the committed is as has that we the this at still still not many more do than 
the wealth that the extent the the capital that annual the laundered through financial regulations as such thousand billion dollar so
this money would can be used for our cities and for other social purposes
i am welcome with this debate and this discussion
i like something say on the  on europol
everyone the the floor has held was the there on agree that this a very valuable initiative is and that we can support what there in the
but as many speakers already said is the democratic control and responsibility not
the by the commission proposed and by all groups effective amendments up the with particularly this
we want that the parliament involved the the the appointment the the director and that there the voted the basis the a majority because if the union the extended to member will the particularly difficult be to everyone agreement to let to with the choice the a certain director
therefore must the decision be taken with a majority the vote we to a twothirds majority for we want also that the parliament involved the the the resignation the the director if that ever necessary will and also than the basis the a twothirds majority
we want that the parliament involved the the the council the administration
we would the the way the democratic responsibility and control enormous can improve
and we want that disputes be presented the the court
already this points are back to find in the amendments and if the debate in the commission only indication was i i there all hope the that the parliament they will approve
i like however my look also just forward throw the what there after this proposal will to
i see two developments a good and a bad
the bad development in the future where many mr programmes including my friend andrews already to referred is the not to with growth the the organised crime as we the in very europe see more
the opening the the borders for the internal market was really a excellent idea but the has the mafia and eastern criminals the help to their  on our whole union from to territory
if the enlargement once a fact is and that is than again the good development where i just to referred the the how longer how difficult for us to the organised crime to combat
criminals can freely borders who but our police can that not
today the day have we already as such different police in the european union the most of in my own member must i fact say because in the united kingdom each county a own police has the exactly to the the borders the that county working
we have now already many to many police and we will there still a many the to after the enlargement us ability to the organised crime the to tackle will far below the necessary level are
we have a europol need that the operational capabilities the to crossborder to work
if i the public meetings am on the growth the the organised crime me i how the the public to hear yes and what do you this than the
i what you must do
concern for the necessary powers
ministerial the police as that we the growing crime the head can offer
the public like that and is as as often us and the ministers a step for
i like very like a response hear the the commissioner the the idea that if the concept the improved and closer cooperation hope next month the the summit the nice will be accepted we a european fbi in the life will to
we need the not a european fbi to mention but that would the the next logical step are
the public would there fully behind are and the is necessary for the future
mr the president to my sorry will i evening in this parliament a somewhat deviance must must let hear apart the that the my mr mrs boumedienethiery
course has this parliament itself a dignified and good objective the
but a good objective is not justify for the use the to the just what resources
i i the feeling that this series initiatives are is the to develop the a way the the protection there in article the the european convention for the rights and fundamental freedoms the the human the the again the
as mrs boumedienethiery also already said think i not that there sufficient account the taken with the right the a honest process and with a fair reflects the the the funded consequence facts
and if that there fear i that we are are with the create the a monster the  although we just as   try good to do
we must there for ensure that we the way to mutual recognition the judgments in europe take the the highest common standard not the smallest lowest lowest if the is to the protection the people the with justice to make to
the has i if member the this parliament a number affairs under the attention the
a example of is someone the the a were the the laundering the money days in portugal in are has sat without officially in the the charges to are the
when the were end was presented was the to there from a marker started as in the portuguese and a summarise of in imperfect english although the person in issue not floor portuguese spoke
in france am i cases encountered the when the the suspicion the trade in drugs resources  that is course a shocking crime if the the this indeed the guilty has made but this people were held under unacceptable circumstances without actually their right the defence the own choice to can exercise without adequate  if the there all already were and without the possibility to their innocence to proof through a correct  within a reasonable term
as such  prevent the the european  must we there extremely carefully the ensure that the steps the we with good intentions take not end the civil freedoms in their most fundamental form destroying do
the mr andrews has right the heavy penalties must indeed be imposed the people the the correct way after a honest process were condemned for the type crime where we the here on have
but we must there for ensure that innocent victims you would the think i many can mention the our war against the crime not  in prisons without contact with their families
that is still to often for here in us presents europe and for i my support can give the as such disastrous race to mutual recognition would i like see that there a common recognition the fair standards is
mr the president i i that from that both the french presidency with are initiatives if also the rapporteurs with their reports in all sincerity try better methods to find for the fight the the regularisation the illegal money
here to the however two important questions
the first to the before proposals end the the the strengthening the the judicial and police cooperation the has the even on the creating the a common european legal area through the communitisation the the criminal and the civil right
the question reads however or there a country in europe is or a area in the world as example the usa where the thanks a common legal area the problem the the laundering the illegal money the effective way has the know to tackle is the perhaps not as that the this doubt real problem if pretext used to communitisation to achieve the bodies the the crucial important are for the national independence and the sovereignty the the people in the member
is the the second with the strengthening the the judicial and police cooperation in the tax and  to combat can the the the head offer the the activities the certain member the with their  for effects  and  in fact the laundering in the hand work
must the perhaps not simply fairer are and admit that other measures economic and social measures need are for the fight the this enormous issue this issue the because the with the way which the economic system working in a fully liberalised and sterckx market
mr the president all countries in the eu want the laundering the money combat and this agreement deserves course our support
in the reality is the however not as simple
i think that the parliament the problems increase in place the simplification and efficiency to achieve this that example from the proposal for the enlargement the the powers the europol
the parliament would the must concentrate the the development the real efficient instruments the fight the the laundering the money and the professional organised crime
the response the the finnish initiative is deplorable but enlightening
the is now clear that actions the this area better through cooperation between the countries done
why eight the the new system the the commission than necessary
to my opinion is the not clear the what way this system must function except that all countries compulsory are a uniform protection the data to apply
otherwise said the fight the the laundering the money must not obstacles be because the commission its actions  the the most accommodating and sections member
the parliament must the initiatives the the council and the the countries the the most motivated are to this crime a stop to to to not block
the parliament must the council and this countries precisely encourage
the the the uniform definitions for criminal facts and the cooperation between the national police and the  are necessary
mr the president i i to this five minutes time asked to i behalf the group from to speak on the report the mrs roure
to the the the like speech the the mr maccormick would i a comment ex want make
we have here three initiatives for the fight the the organised crime one the the large social abuses
this initiatives give demonstrated the a clear political like all forces to unite to further to to and the area the freedom safety and justice to create
therefore must we fragmentation the measures and different situations see to prevent as the mr maccormick the as very has expressed can the different situations in the affected example the a element the the process the protection the the fundamental and the guarantee for a fair procedural
this the rights and guarantee a accompany forms the the european identity would we the the fragmentation and asymmetry precisely additional attention must to
the basis the the agreements the tampere must the guarantee for a fair procedural a place to in the third pillar and the application are the crossborder situations as the mr maccormick has described
that join also the the the contribution the the mr lehne on the problem the the professional the the lawyer in the framework the the fight against the laundering the money
well here have we therefore still a good example the the fight against the laundering the money can the professional the the lawyer in the way to
that professional is absolutely not privilege the the lawyers but a essential part the the rights the the defence the the their turn a essential element are the the architecture the our european culture and identity i understand that the situation difficult is because we must work with fragmented legal
the fight the the laundering the money have we on a directive a framework and a amendment the the convention
we must the a given at mr the president already the texts pool
you and all other present here think i know that by this fragmentation there already directly a false start the made the the application the the new texts by the judges the judges are course those the there the the application for must ensure that the rights the the defence guaranteed are
now address i i the a other issue the also the the with the quality the the legislation
in this report the also a visa on the call the geneva where the group against will vote we vote not against because we against the call are but purely because we if parliament offer must are for 
the call the geneva is not visa and also not legal or value reference to a european council
the initiative the the ppe are there two changes approved in article if we because the political like parts to the organised crime to combat than can we not same for the member a opening make to cooperation we have the on judicial cooperation between judges to refuse under produced the reasons the national important
what is the national important when a judge in the european union a other judge in the european union to cooperation asking
what third authority is intervene to to determine that there a national important in the affected is
the is choose or parts or we want the area really create and the not let the a fine sense in the treaty or we to us involved the that we the text the the treaty the achieve the a area the freedom safety and justice not to in are effort consequence want out
the finally mr the president supports the group the amendment on the activities the lawyers that we with mrs roure agreed are
when a lawyer not professional if  intervene than apply course for him if for each normal human the rules the the ordinary justice because the professional not a personally privilege is but a right that resulting from the system and the guarantee for a fair procedural
in the sense find we the amendment fact unnecessary but with the view the a broad consensus in the sitting will we ensure vote
we know that the commission a difficult task for the has where they with large commitment the working the conclusion mr the president would i the commission want questions this initiatives the i behalf the ppe  in recital to take
mr the president mr the commissioner in the this the the regretted that the borders open for criminals but closed continue for the institutions the with their persecution responsible are
but why surprised this us nothing
you has a europe wanted that purely was focused the the open the the doors for capital and goods
the black capital follows same channels if the other for far many the the operations the the companies the to good name and renowned partisan not just  are if the capital the the 
i like the have on the money that involved is with corruption and on the benefit that drawn the from the exploitation the children in the third world
you you not in the really measures to take to the laundering the black money to prevent because this would the the banks and financial institutions the debt must give since they that money laundering while they the behind behind the secrecy
and all large banks up itself  the in the tax the only but there because there banks are the there use the make
they be the encouraged by the states itself as france and netherlands the  britain the the  and the other places
we are here the only the measures want the the laundering the money really prevent namely the immediate lifting the the secrecy the  the  the opening the the accounts the all banks or industries and the right the all workers the this companies and for all consumers the public the the informed to to the any  the counter against the interests the the community
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues we must everything in the work to to the the economic union also a  to make
this obligation follows continue from the treaty the amsterdam and the summit the tampere
we must the the european union a strong economic unity make that is also the wish the the citizens and the must we account the because the citizens the the european union have right the safety
today discuss we the next step the way to this 
we do that the the hand the the measures for the fight the the laundering the money
money is the driving the the organised crime therefore are the measures all the world the fight the the laundering the we today discuss a part the our fight against the organised crime
if we the succeed to the laundering to prevent can we the end also the organised crime prevent
the organised crime that is here already several times said and that know we also makes huge profits the the drug the trafficking the trade in weapons the smuggling the cars the all activities even the the art
already this illegal voice money the laundered before the in the legal economy ends
that is also the objective the the organised crime and therefore are the organised crime and laundered money also as harmful for the legal economy the the union
this is a introduces invasion the the economy
therefore are this measures for the fight the the laundering the money also as important
we can here however only but something the do when we different instruments combine to the laundering the money to combat
today to we the opportunity to on not less than four reports on such instruments to speak
the first is the enlargement the the powers the europol
we know that europol the now already with certain issues are can the but the laundering the money is there now if separate  the
that is also sensible
we must there however also the think to europol enough staff and enough money the available to to to the new powers also actually from to exercise
i would this opportunity want opportunity to just if my colleagues for i to demands that there last a end the made the a verging situation europol must just if the other institutions the the european union the a control be subject
the second measure the second instrument is the harmonisation
the has only but sense to europol this powers to to know when we the succeed to also the provisions the the criminal content and formally to harmonise the mean i the definition the the punishable fact the penalties or the common the the profits from criminal facts
the third point is very important we must also the mutual assistance improve
mrs palacio has this with emphasis the out they has clear made that we the people the this responsible are absolutely the must involve and also the member the the sense must to that in this the the european interests over the national interests are
the last point and that should there according i also the is the up the eurojust or a time bureau we must namely ensure for a better coordination the the criminal research and the the prosecution
the european union and therefore also the european parliament the a new opportunity where in the fight against this organised crime a subject which we us as close deal
the the the union a first stone for the overhaul the the economic union to a 
mr the president mr the commissioner best colleagues the economic development and the globalisation are the last years accompanied has the a increase the the international crime
according the united nations the there annual tune dollar laundered in the european union must we the laundering the money the madeline way continue combat
the must we the aware that with particularly after the expedite the the internal market and the liberalisation the the markets and the financial services real police and judicial cooperation between the member is is the cooperation must moreover as efficient possible are
today discuss we three reports which recognised the that the laundering the money the capitalisation is the the organised crime therefore must that crime where the also committed the be eradicate
the this the in that the specific measures for to the proceeds the crime the to encourage to freeze in up to take and to confiscate for the measures is according the rapporteur a joint mobilising the the police and judicial resources need so there guarantees are that the criminals or the proceeds the not can  in the european union
i am the with the core the the report agree but i the question the the proposal the the rapporteur the framework also to to apply the smaller crime
with this framework like the the serious crime combat the the the laundering the money viewed and not the small crime if the small crime which lower penalties apply under this framework would the would we the us objective over can support
the karamanou like the  the europol enlargement to the laundering the money by the police cooperation to strengthen and europol to to rest with more instruments
the is here to a portuguese initiative that already by different previous speakers is praised
to finally like i say that the  a large number legal obstacles for mutual assistance like fears
the report as also the approve the practical measures order the mutual assistance to strengthen i would wish that the parliament in this report the approach the the professional in the already adopted lehne on the laundering the money followed
as here have we when recognised that the professional a essential element is the the justice any violation the that right can a violation the the civil freedoms the the citizens content
mr the president to to start must i the parliament let know that i the appeal lawyer am although my who the the portuguese item the lawyers the my request is suspended
i bonino my contribution from that perspective because the amendment the article in the  is even in the upon the the amendment a unacceptable of the the professional the the lawyer
the professional is the condition for and is the result the the  between the lawyer and are lawyerclient
that the further from the the absolutely the the lawyer possibly the are lawyerclient the to him in right the to are because the  the already by the danger fact that the lawyerclient the the lawyer to strongly is or him in confidence the
the charter the the fundamental that recently is approved rules in article that everyone the right has the in right to let advise defend and represent and in article that for any suspicious the respect the the rights the the defence guaranteed is
as see is the professional a inalienable duty the the lawyer
the end would find are if the lawyer not bound would are the the professional and the   would be
the lack the effectiveness or the helplessness the the authorities the responsible are with the research to the laundering the money or to the just what another crime must not be cars the the lawyers well on the compromise for this point can i say that the choose or parts is
or the relevant article refers to people the the turn the certain activities and than must lawyers or other professional not with particularly mentioned be or the reference in the article to consultants fact the a certain situation what the the already a threat means for the professional despite the  and the competences the the activities which referred the
when a lawyer intervene if financial adviser is there not few reason to say that he in the capacity the appeal the lawyer not exercised
i shall i to mr the president the going position the the portuguese item the lawyers to repeat the professional is the cornerstone the and the condition for the appeal the lawyer
a lawyer the still still the position the the portuguese item the suspected the the criminal practices or complicity the such practices can just if any other citizens persecuted be but not few lawyer can compulsory be declaration to do the facts which he in knowledge is the from under the are disagree
everything what not fully does with the failure the the law is the lawyer banned
the item the lawyers has the last and decisive floor if the is to the professional since that body in exceptional cases the request the the legal authorities must determine or there permission can be given for the public make the certain facts
because already the reasons mr the president will i against the amendment the article vote even against the wording the the amendment in the legislative
mr the president gentlemen members as several speakers already have stressed have we here a three determination on a activity the the core is the the organised crime to know the laundering the money
same is the the laundering the organised crime also the  this they the that at trying the yield the illegal activities the legal economy within to bring
and the that at can the member by police and judicial cooperation the most effective intervene to the organised crime to combat
that was the political like the the state and government in october during the european council the council the tampere expressed have they asked when the laundering the money specific to combat
also was the also the issue the the joint meeting the the council the ministers the justice and home affairs and the council the ministers the economic affairs and finance the october on
the commission is pleased on the fact that the meeting has up and supports the french initiative a framework the the council good to approve on the laundering the money the identification detection freeze adopted and common the resources and the the proceeds the crime
we are that convinced that this framework a important step forward is in the direction the common sanctions for all member the the european union
with this framework have we on two legal the for two types crime not only common charges but also common sanctions set
i objective here the the framework on the protection the the euro and the before framework on the laundering the money
therefore would i the mr marinho want congratulate with are excellent report i endorse are view that we the laundering the money if crime further must defining to end common sanctions the european level to can the
i believe that with particularly further would must be consideration on the proposal the the gentlemen member common sanctions in to to for the cases the less been penalised be or for other illegal acts as mentioned in article the the agreement the the council the europe on the laundering the money
that not not directly to done but can done the basis the a assessment the the common action what in december decided is but that however still not already are effects has sorted
also would i the parliament want ask the term the december to review which the commission a report would must present on the transposition the the framework in national right
i i this request in the light the the amendments on the dates for the into the this framework in national standards with the new dates the the rapporteur proposed is because december the effort date become for the transposition by the member
we are the agree agree that the motives for the refuse the criminal cooperation in article the the agreement the be review indeed must as mrs roure already the in its report where i moment the back will to the cases which judicial cooperation can be refused further be contained
also like i mrs roure congratulate with its report on the initiative the the french presidency for a agreement on the improvement the the mutual assistance in criminal in the particularly the the area the the fight the the organised crime
also like i remind remind that this agreement in close cohesion must be given with both the directive the amendment the the directive the june on the laundering the money the in treatment is the the council the ministers the economic affairs and finance if with the debate that the council the ministers the justice and home affairs has taken on the tax and the secrecy
that debate was on the  the a appeal the the tax and the secrecy in criminal if the with a such appeal the judicial cooperation the the combat the the laundering the money would want prevent
the commission state still in pending the the opinion the the parliament on this problem we are however the opinion that the decisions the the appeal the the tax and the secrecy impossible make if the the aim the persecution the crime with the laundering the money to prevent fundamental instruments are to the success the legislation the european level to guarantee
to the the the proposal the mrs roure would i its want ask after to think on the next argument the seems i more to say that the refusal the judicial cooperation by the petitioned member without the the lightly member must be pointed in place the a term the two months the to to
i interpret without if demanding than a term the two months for the report the the refusal to cooperation
also like i you let know that i aware how sensitive the issue is the the conditions including judicial cooperation the the combat the the laundering the money with justified reasons can be refused because the overriding the legal professions
this subject is by different members the the item the but as you know is this issue not under the competence the the council the ministers the justice and home affairs but under the competence the the council the ministers the economic affairs and finance
and i movement still in pending the the opinion the the european parliament on this issue
that opinion must according i clear and unequivocal standards contain for the guarantees the the defence the the suspects and the conditions including legitimate a appeal can be done the the professional the lawyers in the general and lawyers in the particularly
but i like here today especially stress that in all determination same definition applied must be
that like say that the definition the the parliament favour in are opinion on the directive on the laundering the money right must are the the legal solution in the agreement on mutual assistance
different wordings in the two instruments will only lead to greater confusion the the interpretation and difficulties the the application in the practice
the commission is satisfied that the parliament support its the the enlargement the the  the europol to all forms the the laundering the money
the report the mrs karamanou the i also with its report like congratulate contains different amendments on the strengthening the the democratic and judicial control the europol
you know that i the democratic and judicial control the europol important think
fair must i you however say that according i this initiative not the right opportunity is to on this issue decisions to take
the commission at other the this at in the framework the the work the the scoreboard for the achieve the a area the freedom safety and justice the socalled scoreboard the best way to a legal good to approve so europol communitised can be the a other way than by fragmented measures in the framework the the convention
the best way to the parliamentary and the judicial control the europol to strengthen is the integration the the convention in the legal the the european union
therefore i i also the necessary doubts on the apply the the mechanism the article member paragraph d the the treaty for the force the this amendment the the convention
the seems us that the enlargement the the powers the europol same in all member must done and not in the time must be spread what the confusion would can do increase
mr the president the am the commission that the parliament this three initiatives can support the initiatives are all three important to the strategy the the fight against the laundering the money to strengthen
we hope not only that the member this initiatives in the council quickly will approve but also that the relevant agreements quickly will be ratified so they in the national context the force can be
you thank mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
time justice 
the the item is the report a the mrs gebhardt behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the republic portugal the french republic the kingdom sweden and the kingdom belgium with the view the the adoption the the decision the the council to up the a time justice  c cns
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues the democratic rule assumptions the the prosecution often behind the criminals the that is the price the the freedom
that applies especially for the heavy and for the crossborder crime
the is particularly difficult to over to to the the organised crime because the opportunities are far the right
the perpetrators know not decency and not borders they the the not the rules or restrictions
the  are to good reasons bound the the rules the the rule
that sounds pessimistic but there is hope
the european union meeting progress in the fight against the heavy crime
they has a good opportunity to the head the many criminals objectives to make and them a appropriate punishment the to to
that should the citizens expect especially should they that also expect in a already reinforced area the right and freedom the their safety and protection offers also where the their material  the
a step in the right direction the the european parliament already long like to is the create the a time bureau for the judicial cooperation
according i must the floor time as quickly possible disappear and place make for eurojust if efficient european organisation for the prosecution
the impetus is the the german minister the justice the its initiative has the summit the tampere over a year ago decided to eurojust in the life to to
since have portugal france sweden and belgium further steps the by a time bureau for the judicial cooperation in the life to to
in tampere is decided to with through the eurojust the cooperation between the member in the fight against the organised crime to strengthen
the member send  the justice judges and  the ensure for the crossborder cooperation between the public ministries the the individual member and for the support the the criminal research to the organised crime
the is the intention that eurojust closely together with other european institutions and with the european judicial network
if rapporteur like i fact still but one wish express
the cooperation must not limited continue to the organised crime we must us in the important the the citizens with the whole spectrum the heavy and crossborder crime deal
therefore i i proposed to the legal from to extend and also article the the treaty on the european union to to apply
the competent commission has the the members and also the signals from the council sound fortunately very positive
also in a another respect must we for a joint approach choose
the provisional bureau that we now discuss can only a first step are the way the through eurojust to a really european public prosecutor must lead
that is in the joint fight against the heavy crime not only to organisational reasons need
the is also need given the principles the the rule
already with already is this task as large and important that the council the not only tackles
after the decision the the council in tampere must the commission its knowledge and experience working and the european parliament expression give the are political like
when the council the commission and the parliament one line draw will that end a considerable added gentlemen that for the citizens the europe the right and the safety will there the the see
i believe that the decision the tampere and the initiative the the four member a good beginning are
let we together the this way pursue
gentlemen mr programmes although the need the a future european public prosecutor not  seems seems the i the more than fundamental important that us policy the regard the the protection the the rights the the citizens and with particularly our invalid harmonised be
how can we namely a european public prosecutor the established to if we even not community civil code have and worse still not european code the criminal
although the the up the eurojust not directly in the way is there there namely already a institution the still not by the european parliament controlled the and which not legal control by the court the justice the the european communities accordance article the the treaty the application is
how can we therefore consider eurojust the to up while europol already secondarily its the can to
we must two points for view the we can not real improvement the the judicial cooperation between member consider without that this clearly subject the the the protection the the right the defence in the judicial procedures which several member involved are
that is the thrust the our amendments
the follows that the rights the the citizens by means the a effective instrument strengthened must to be and that the competence the the court the justice recognised must be with particularly if the comes the are  and the are competence the or not judgement to do
the gaps in the new into in the fight the the organised crime have moreover the the the distribution the the powers between europol and eurojust the no and in not only respect clear the be
as you know affects the issue the the powers and the borders this the the core the the community harmonisation the to a better justice must lead
a clear distribution the the  between the judicial and the police cooperation is not only need to each competence to avoid but they is also fundamental for the guarantee that the democratic rules the the the basis are the the rule observed be
all member the the european community support this the basis the their legislative executive and legal systems accordance the principle the the fundamental and the the common values
eurojust must the therefore add to the relationship between the judicial and the police cooperation
the european parliament is the supranational body the this relationship the must to and i call you to the the validity of to support by you behind the rapporteur to already
mr the president i like i like with the my other mr programmes and the rapporteur congratulate with its work even already can i not fully agree with what they has proposed
in the european union are we how longer how more the direction applaud the reinforced cooperation and coordination as mrs palacio already said the areas as the internal market and the environment
there are however problems same the the whole area the police and legal affairs with particularly because fear or lack the confidence in the effectiveness or the ability the individual police or individual legal to the head to offer the the extent the the crime the now the a crossborder level swiftly
to the reason was the the summit the tampere under more the proposal done to up the eurojust
although i there not only problem that i that our judges and lawyers in the member opportunities be is to information from to exchange together to work meet to to and a better understanding to to the each approach i i the certainly problems with the so the this whole debate namely the appointment the a european public prosecutor
although the us assures that a european public prosecutor only a limited mandate will to is that not the end the the story because we have different legal in the european union
as is in ireland and in the united kingdom the code the criminal based the the  while that for the most other european countries the there right or civil right is
the enormous differences to daily to expression the europol and interpol where a lack the security there and there problems are between the police in the member with the to what there exactly must and can
the makes the in the member itself also ensure as i from a irish blame can confirm i i i are taken with cases the people the in spain 
we could europol or  in that country far to something to take and the seemed not to understand that suspects as quickly possible must be 
to the reason believe i although i for more cooperation and coordination am that the mistake would are to here a legislative system the to make and we would this therefore against are
mr the president in the during the this partsession will we us express on many proposals the aim a area the justice and safety to create
i late the floor freedom way because the tendency the the council and the member i repeat the the council and the member to the repressive european framework to strengthen and because the zones approval the the parliament that the by in to vote with such proposals its status if democratic elected institution worthy shows
the members the the bonino are not prepared the strategy the the council to support the council remains the behind behind apparently minimalist proposals the however not only the basis to for a european system and a european punishment and procedural but also for a european police and a european  a system that based is the eurojust and the european public prosecutor the european legal network europol and the task force the the  the police the corpus juris the european bureau for fraud the conventions for mutual legal assistance enfopol etc a endlessly bureaucratic web that the itself already undemocratic is
we hope just if mrs palacio that the time quickly disappears from this judicial  but we radical members are not prepared the experience with europol on to do when after the unity drugs a  was up that constantly is and extended the and not the the democratic control the the national parliaments and the european parliament is subject
mr programmes know you certainly that the european citizens the national parliaments and yourself a functionalist strategy want follow in the sectors justice and safety together a the the pillars the the democracy
you you not afraid that the freedoms and the rights the the citizens end by europe will be  in place the guaranteed and strengthened
we have only a amendment the this report tabled which the council the asked what for a european judicial area he the the view has and especially in what he the rules the the punishment and procedural think to harmonise what institutions and organisms he like up with what power and powers how they will work what democratic control there planned is and if last what rights there the the citizens guaranteed be
only when the institutional model and the rules the the european judicial area are clarify can the citizens and the parliament the express on the individual measures the the council proposed
if there not direction with a precise and for everyone clear objective the ones is the union according us doomed the out to are both institutional if democratic
to this reasons in name the the european federalist liberal and democratic values will the members the the  bonino against this proposal and the report vote
and that applies also for a large number other proposals and reports that during this partsession will be dealt
mr the president i join i the the the few dissidents and warn for the ideas plans and projects the their impact find in this series reports on the legal policy including the report the mrs gebhardt
in the explanatory the clear described that the legal cooperation currently institutionalised the better said the trying they supranational to make
in the report the literally a  for a future european public prosecutor that the judicial on the the eu with the to the criminal strengthened and there the referred to the drafting the a european criminal with corresponding institutions police public prosecutor law etc what under other decided was to the the the  in
the two points is the serious the mistake in the first with the to the  the the criminal
the criminal systems are a the the most obvious validity the a society
different legal cultures to here with other in contact because there is not that if a uniform european criminal or a european  ideology there are there the each fifteen
by this projects in the different masterly the the eu in to build or to institutionalising the a obscure  system that the many points in fight is with basic democratic and 
the second point is also interesting
there be few decisive steps done for the up the the united states the europe
the title is in this respect significant the up the eurojust a safeguards commandment
on what rule has the the
is the eu a the become
yes because as in the last paragraph the the first part the the explanatory clear the is the because the intention that the european union bodies elsewhere where the legislative executive and legal power equal and independent addition other there this everything is characterise for a the
to this two reasons can the the my group not cooperation expect
mr the president programmes create the common legal is are the to develop
they must based are the common standards and values and a broad political support have
the proposal for the introduction the a time justice  is extremely welcome
the council has the for the first a step the in the direction the a institutionalisation the the judicial cooperation something what already since long time a demand is the the group
a condition for demanded is a enlargement the the judicial cooperation in criminal issues if  the the powers the europol
eurojust is therefore a logical step in the increase the the level the security the the citizens in a area with freedom security and justice because the the fight against serious forms the organised crime search
the task the the  unity must are the simplify the the coordination the the tasks the the national public ministries and the support the the criminal research to the organised crime
the integrate the the time team requires a close clear regulated cooperation with europol to responsibilities and duplication work to prevent
the introduce the the provisional  is only a first step
the rapporteur is the opinion that the experience the introduction the the second stage eurojust would must simplify i part this opinion
a possibly european public prosecutor is a issue the still discussed must be
the fight the fraud in affairs which the european financial interests are involved is i i the task the a future european public prosecutor and this must are only task also continue
with the view the the subsidiarity i i a whole the law and the eu if common  body in the whole criminal the if someone something like topical find
where the parliament the today on must express is a strong legal cooperation the fight the serious forms the organised crime
that is a positive matter the is therefore gratifying that the parliament the as broad supported the
i am with particularly welcome with the initiative for a greater protection the data
i congratulate mrs gebhardt with the good work that they has made
the conclude like i point the something what we not should forget
without a certain cooperation can we the common by in a eu with free movement not maintain
for a more crime must we the protection the the people increase and the protection must based are the our common same
mr the president mr the commissioner best colleagues i like mrs gebhardt congratulate with its excellent report that resulting from one the the decisions the tampere
the criticism is rightly that in compared with the police cooperation the judicial cooperation only late started is with particularly if the involved what enormous extent the organised and crossborder crime has adopted aware the that this rapid common and coordinated action need is
eurojust makes part from the the european mechanism the fight the the organised crime that the the balanced development the the police and judicial cooperation in the european union to strengthen and to guarantee
the current proposal for the up the a time justice  must given be if the first stage the the criticisms the eurojust
if the team once work must the the right coordination and the close cooperation promote between the national ensuing and  the team must act when there two or more member the involved are and common action requires is
the national legislation the any member must the course the always respected be
the police experience with this provisional team must also if point must for the up the the decision on the up the eurojust
the parliament wishes the powers the europol to strengthen and in that the has the repeatedly the attention located the the necessary democratic control the europol
eurojust must in this the than also ensure for a greater judicial control
commissioner antónio vitorino has the previous debate concluded by the attention to draw the a uncontrollable initiative for a measure the at is the the misguided the europol we look  from to the at which that proposal the tabled so we there us to due time on can express
mr the president i would to to start mrs  briefly want congratulate with its excellent report and want say that the commission almost all parts which its considerations are motivated can support
i concerned the the opportunity use since several members very lies issues have raised to you clearly and ready to say as the mr other just that this initiative the us especially can if a first initiative which the council are political like shows the behind the the judicial cooperation the relation the police cooperation has behind in to to
and i say you very honest that i not understand how the this initiative to judicial cooperation the  can country if a breach the or a threat the the guarantee and the protection the the fundamental
the must said to be or you shares the democratic model that we know that based is the the separation the powers that recognises that the courts the highest bodies are to the individual rights to guarantee and you recognises that the european  cooperation there now precisely from there the coordination the the european courts in their role if terms the the fundamental to strengthen
let this completely clear are
we are not are the harmonisation the the european criminal to redefining
in tampere is us asked transnational rules the to to to the transnational crime to can combat the looked namely in that the transnational nature or supranational if you you the the legal instruments a added offers in the fight against illegal or criminal practices the per definition supranational are
criminals need not to doubt the their supranational nature
therefore has the us in tampere asked to common rules for  and penalties against  drug trafficking pornography terrorism and cyber the recognised namely that you supranational criminal activities with supranational instruments must combat
but since we the with eurojust have on coordination between national magistrates and filed the justice to any form the heavy crime to combat and the join i i the the the approach the mrs the rapporteur the the understanding extended we speak not only more on cooperation in the fight the the purely transnational crimes but also on cooperation the the punish the criminal activities
that the example the case the a criminal the in a member a crime can and then given the seriousness the the offence to a other member flight
as to we the the area the the fight against the insecurity in the general with respect the not only the national constitutions but also the national 
that like say that the action the any italian does with are national legislation and that the powers to the to act and to fighting against this type crime within the framework the the national legislation the any member the
therefore see i not in how there as a european judicial big brother would the
i see even not in how there a european public prosecutor would the to my sorry must i the say as you know has the commission namely proposed a european public prosecutor the to up but not in this context not for this issues
the proposal the the commission is very at and is presented the who that all the intergovernmental conference
what has the commission proposed
a european public prosecutor in the life to to to the financial interests the the european community to protect
this can the indeed speak on a european public prosecutor
but now on eurojust that is a network to the action the the national magistrates and filed the justice to coordinate with if objective the timid in the fight against the heavy crime the european level to increase
and therefore see i the also if a important instrument to the legal control the europol to guarantee
in tampere is namely clear said that eurojust the judicial counterpart the europol would be
that like say that if europol part the the into and prosecute the criminals this activities monitored and followed must be by eurojust if network the magistrates and filed the justice the european level
therefore must the mutual relations between eurojust europol olaf if specialised body for fraud and the already existing european justice network good down be
the commission is welcome with your report mrs gebhardt
i hope that the parliament the favour
from january will we the opportunity to us itself in to effort in that provisional team but the commission like continue with the debate on what the final  must be
therefore will we in the council and in the parliament a proposal for a communication on the final justice  present to as quickly possible on a picture a vision to have the what later the final version the the network will are
you thank mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
programme fair
the the item is the report a the mrs langenhagen behalf the commission control on the special report no the the court with the to  the the area the agriculture and fisheries programme fair    research accompanied the the answers the the commission c cos
mr the president mr the commissioner on two days the here a another important subject dealt namely the annual the the court for the year that is the first budget the least the partly is under the responsibility the the new commission
the that report is the very clear that the new commission aware must make the fair is the however to a type difficult legacy from the past
the  is on research the the area the fisheries agriculture and the agrofood industry the was a part the the fourth framework for the  the to
in the years is already with already million euro from the budget the the community for the programme fair spent compared with the total amount the billion euro for the fourth framework is that a small amount but the is enough to there what research the to turn
i i already said that the programme fair that in the special report the the court the mentioned a difficult legacy from the past is
you would can say that the parliament not old cows from the talking would must to also already because the commission everything now however already better does
this reasoning can i however not follow
if representatives the the european citizens have we finally a auditing the must we exercise otherwise lose we our credibility
that means also that we later must control also already happening that in this case indeed rather late
for this report i i many discussions held with the court and with the commission but also with both parties same
this small trialogue if i the as must mention is a fair and open discussion been
my supplementary questions are satisfactory answered
all parties have according i honest responded without rigid positions in to take
i i the that the atmosphere constructive was and characterised was by the openness and flexibility where as often to asked the this was not confrontation the two lame  shells
we should this certainly if a new form the cooperation as
this like i the court and the commission with emphasis thank
the drafting the the investigated the the researchers is many better become
the control is never a objective the the we want the something improve
end want we however all same the controllers and the  and why
because we the european money in the future better want to
already with already is the report balanced the the account with the different interests
however must i a number points the criticism mention
i hope however that the commission its promises presuppose and for the fifth framework for the  the necessary improvements see
what are the most criticisms
the whole procedure take to long and is in the current form unacceptable
i say that in all clarity and you know the also
the is unacceptable that not less than two year expiry between the beginning the the research and the produce the a report the the parliament
something topical would the information however must are
i i the the not on the implementation the the control this is what time for need i i the on the sent procedure and perhaps also on the publication that
we must this something the do
we must as quickly possible methods develop to the special report within a reasonable term to can publish
in its answer the my question on this subject has the commission possible procedures described but unfortunately has that to now to not useful results has
given the important the the research for the agriculture and the fisheries is the unfortunately that we a number problems have had the the the the with the way which the programme organised is
the description the the selection remains example unclear and the application that consistency the is sometimes not understandable what projects subsidised be
also are there mistakes made the the confirm the the expenditure and are the possible sanctions to limited also are the links between the experts and certain organisations the the the research are involved according i not over all doubt become
i like there especially the point that the cooperation between the involved directoratesgeneral research agriculture and fisheries not satisfactory was that must in the future more done
certainly also on my classification the fisheries like i say that i there despite everything the angered we all three together will try the policy in the future to improve
mr the president the report the the commission fisheries was in any case reasonable record
fact were the problems in the with the expenditure also not as such  for the commission fisheries other areas  us greater ensure
the court has a positive and reasonable report produced but when we here once on talk had in the commission and the problems had principles and to the explanation had listened were we there the more the convinced that the same problems not the advance had can be for and that they corrected could be
i remind i that the was to a particularly large number projects
the amount is not low million euro but the fits spread on approximately projects and with the limited human and resources where the commission time on time was the not simple to precise in the monitoring to the what there all was
as the many other sections the the budget was as such the the total the the expenditure done through a or other form the public in the member
the money was the business therefore not without more in the into minds the a small part after
a large part the the expenditure was under monitoring the the member
we are welcome with the  in the new programme so the money not more in management the given the the makers in a directorategeneral but the the people the research do
we think that we the people the interested are in research a constructive approach the research should expect than the people the a the policy must manage as the agriculture
we want the rapporteur also still in are general thank for the fact that they this the attention has located the the problems the in this the play and we look from to a more and  function the the programme in amended form
mr the president i am welcome with this report the mrs langenhagen and i can the content that with pleased support
the report the the court on the  that the basis for the report the the rapporteur was was only in march the this year published although the  on the control already in december and february to the commission were sent
as the rapporteur also already proposed is that simply unacceptable
there is many too time has and that undermining the forum the the work the the parliament if the the on as such report going
that there so time thorough is is by the  procedure the the followed by court and commission previous the any publication the a report the the court a procedure the the commission the right the to its answer the same at to publish if the report
the delay has there in this case to led that the rapporteur the very rightly operating or the still the sense has the  procedure in its current form to maintain
that is a aspect where i certainly further the in will to in my report that in december in the parliament will be discussed
time will i the let the the suggestion that the whole procedure still a time under the look must be taken not only in the with the annual the the court that tomorrow published the but also if the is to special reports as this
the report the the court makes report the a number important problems the the management the the  in the period to and with including a lack the quantified objectives for the programme what a good levels the the results difficult not transparency the the selection and procedures and the the management the measures by three dg programmes
this was that there in the management the the programme a lack was the clarity and great
we hope that the reforms the the this at way are within the commission will lead to a strong  approach in the future
the lack the clear direction and the opportunities to the results to can measure is absolutely unacceptable and would in not few other institution can prevent
this are all replacement cows
we know best that there changes the both are but we want like that this almost that the made
than are we still with that problem the the million euro the still still rabble must be the that amount is effectively through three dossiers the already since june and august be investigated by the legal service the the commission cases which the expiry has are
the is the vital important that the commission the dossiers harden and its money into
we will the next time the the footing follow what there happening with the recommendations in this report and insist there therefore the the commission the the the matter as quickly possible right to to otherwise can you that the the that there in the reports on the discharge  this report and other special reports the referred
mr the president i congratulate mrs langenhagen with its report
i think that they in all respects a clear description has given the the large problems the the the implementation the the  and the the control the the function the the programmes are in
in this the think i the unacceptable that the commission despite its large expertise many things what we together have decided not the implement has the
behalf the commission fisheries like i only few points because
before new programmes begun be must the the existing programmes to evaluate
with through the the scientific research that a important part the us policy is in this case the fisheries must ex calculated be what the like and how the the budget like use so the available resources the each at the the  and opportunities can be adapted
after the experience from the past when three directoratesgeneral involved were the the coordination and the management the the actions is the commission fisheries also the opinion that clear the must be who the the three the leadership has and responsible is for the implementation the the decisions
mr the president gentlemen colleagues mr the commissioner i would the rapporteur the i want congratulate with this report
the is according i particularly fair moderate and balanced the is in the commission than also with unanimity the vote approved
i like only a few points mention the according i essential are for the future control the the research in the general
the seems i important what the rapporteur for opinion for the commission fisheries has said if we not the advance clear objectives defining is the not possible to in the important the the taxpayers the we represent a really clear control to out and to assess how effective the policy is
that seems i a the the most blame in the report the the court to are
the the in the situation namely commitology to the effectiveness the the policy to determine
the second the the area the the hierarchy the the  are here things the a unacceptable way by other achieved mr the commissioner
in point the the report the the court the that free clear said
that a  the in the the necessary resources has granted in the hierarchy under who is the for the dossier responsible is that is unacceptable
the official answer this the the commission in the dossier is that there always still a directorgeneral is that is very 
i believe not that someone the something to make has with financial management and also with the control the the financial management a such answer satisfactory would can find
i hope mr the commissioner that we with the view the the already by mrs morgan mentioned reform the the commission not only will ensure for a reform the the financial rules but especially also for a full application the the existing financial rules
the financial rules is a miracle the wisdom everything the agreement from other taken the is however unfortunately when in the practice everything by other the achieved and that seems here to are happened
mr the commissioner after the particularly critical report on the common research but also after the special  on a very particularly contract with a consultancy to we very soon still more reports the the court or reports and the have than also already the the the new commission
i hope that we than also prepared are to really something to do the the points the mrs langenhagen has mentioned
mr the president ladies and gentlemen members i thank you for the important that you importance the the particularly report the the court on the activities the the programme fair
my thank is with particularly from to mrs langenhagen for its very constructive report and to the members the the commission control as to the commission fisheries with particularly the rapporteur the mr busk
by the dialogue with the court and the services the the commission and by the important that you remind importance has you and this thank i you for the spirit the the this report the basis is stressed
also has you said that the programme fair was included in the fourth framework
that was the when i my his if commissioner inserted but the current commission and its commissioner must ensure ensure that there learn the drawn from your work and that there result the given the the recommendations the the court this formulated has
thanks the report can we us a believe forms on the method and the way which the situation the has developed
i would however want emphasise that there not only case the fraud or misappropriation is noted
that must we for view the because this there sometimes confusion on
the is the important this to outside to good clear to make
as said has the  a budget the million euro
there are more than proposals for received which there more than financial supported are
the  is also quickly mobilised the the beginning the the bse and that year is there after a call to proposals a european action for transmissible  bovine started
the like i stress that the the a number problems a very positive role has played
what questions are there the what improvements are there made
i like you there a few mention the already are included in the fifth framework and the encourage with the recommendations the the court
the the first place must you know that the management the the agronomic research after a restructuring the the services the the commission transferred is the the dg agriculture to the dg research which there a certain uniformity is in the  the the dg agriculture
that is not the case for the  but was the the case for agriculture
to the coordination good to do has is there further a  up to to ensure for a better coordination between the implementation the the research programmes and the competent directoratesgeneral the responsible are for the other policies
the the third place has the commission the all specific programme programmes same procedure applied to the  to assess the procedure is for everyone available in the common 
there is for the assessment the the proposals a common and transparent  the experts up and the organisation there very hard for to the independence the the experts in the assessment the the proposals to guarantee
there is a common database for research up
in the new  be now all financial and administrative aspects in detail down are the responsibilities the the participants more reflect and is the negotiations better documented
the commission has also the number controls considerably increased their number is the last years annual with increased
the measures are therefore for in the fifth framework and be now applied
when i in function force i i further immediately the initiative taken to up the a informal group the the has into on the simplification and the improvement the the procedures i i this already can speak within the commission industry external trade research and energy
that membership that the commission the not new has left and that they now result the the your comments
we must us aware are the the developments and time vigilant continue because the this area there there not dawn
more to more because there in the report a number points the highlighted the improve must to be as you has stressed
i will a few points quote and you say how we on think we have different types activities developed to the annual monitoring the the research programmes the a independent opinion will on the the and the implementation the our programme programmes to improve
our measures for in a analysis the the way which the research in the framework the the national and the eu programmes practical managed the to the best methods from to exchange and more the other to can learn they for further in the financing the studies to the socioeconomic consequences the the framework to evaluate and in the launch the  to the effects the the substantive projects to assess
just if the commission is the parliament the opinion that the joint responsibility for the implementation the the projects very close the the joint financial responsibility is
but i like however the a point because namely that a joint financial responsibility in strict sense within the framework unthinkable is that framework has if objective groups to forms the there from different partners universities the smes large companies and public or private research
the partners can between impossible sufficient financial guarantees find and the smes can not necessarily responsible be the for the bankruptcy the the other members the the consortium
the is clear that there by in  to work not  created the in the joint financial responsibility
the problem is many more in other for this points must we course methods find the a large extent the security provide but we must avoid that we the the smes or the public institutions the the framework out from fear that they responsibilities to allocated the they not competitive
we must therefore a good balance see to find in the joint financial responsibility but hand nor the partners the the consortium deterrent in that case will namely only the only participate while we the participation the the central and small precisely want promote
i am the other fully with you agree that the need is the risk the double financing to a minimum to to
the must you know that the services the the commission in the framework the action the the paper the the reform now already a central register the the prepare are for the contracts the by the commission are concluded that register will later linked be the all financial systems the the commission
you has course still other issues raised i refer under more to the problem that mrs langenhagen in its introduction the the item proposed on the time the has is between the  and the treatment the the report in the parliament
the time is on the the relations between the commission and the court there are as you has stressed few years thorough has but the is for the hand that we learn must draw from the the the affairs
since are there measures taken the the level the the internal organisation the our services to the  the the court as many possible to up
the is completely clear that the dialogue need is there is course a shared responsibility therefore must the court the dialogue also initiate but i can you assure that the court and services the the commission as the parliament this problems in each case constructive want tackle
the come i the the question the mrs morgan on the repayment the appropriations
the is to a amount the million euro that seems perhaps many but makes only the the programme from
that the only is like course not say that the not rabble must be and that we not must try the back to find
i assure you that the services the the commission everything in the work have the to the sums in issue back to to but the competent services have the dossier two year ago forwarded for legal procedures
the the three dossiers the by the legal service the the are commission dealt are there two now progress to the stage the a proceedings since they subject are the the current national legislation
the procedure is therefore in the the but we really us now the area where the jurisdiction the the member applies and this have we the deadlines not always itself in the hand
but i stress that this three mentioned dossiers the the amount represent
we have therefore really work the the repayment the the million and you can say that we this for more than in are 
then was there a question on the fisheries and the person the the control effect the has i just the answer given
the involved person working now the the appropriate level
what the dg agriculture affects is the problem resolved by the competent team on to transfer to the dg research
the could the policy better coordinated be
that are the answers the i the your questions can give
there must still new applications be implemented and i concerned the the opportunity use to you also to parts what guidelines we for the community research in the future framework want develop the commission industry external trade research and energy has the already dealt because i i the october the the parliamentary commission a guidelines tabled and there will a report be up
with a number parts the the broad guidelines can the bureaucratic burden considerably enlightened be the being the a  approach to a  approach the institution the a minimum extent for the projects shipboard the a number activities as the  for the central and small benefits the conducted and in the general simplification the the procedures
i think that there in the future framework considerable changes must to be made
we will see what effects the changes in the fifth framework have sorted and i like you ensure thank that you to improvement an you
that is also the to the the commission and i hope that we in the best possible circumstances can work the achieve the this the european level necessary research the implementation that must however the as efficient possible are and the financial control good
you thank mr the commissioner

the mr bethell your comment has not the the the approval the the minutes i can you however with pleased let know that the conference the presidents has decided the sakharov for this year to to know the the association  
the price will during the partsession the december the this association be prize
the minutes be approved
draft fundamental the the european union
the the the item is the recommendation a the the members duff and voggenhuber behalf the commission constitutional affairs on the approval the the draft the the fundamental the the european union on
mrs the president if member from kitzsteinhorn like i you first the i thank for your comfort words the yesterday friday take in the  rather the  place for the great disaster the my country in the over decades affected has
i know that the parliament that will  i thank you for your words the participation and comfort for the those
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen after nine months work and large efforts to a consensus to achieve is now the draft the the fundamental the the european union for
we must today only yes or no say the rapporteurs to the plenary sitting for the charter the the fundamental good to approve
we do that with full conviction
as many under you regret also i that we today only but yes or no can say and the council not other political signals can give we had like expression given the the critical support the the parliament for the charter the the fundamental
i remind you the the gentlemen the the charter if the the adopted
there is a first unwritten right namely the right the the people to their rights to know
that right the now reality
the vague wordings and legal the the union be in a clear  report that for all institutions and the the application the the european right for the member binding is
the gentlemen the the charter is also in the fact that inalienable but nonbinding not  rights without guarantees in the law to legal and even to constitutional principles the the union be made the charter the the fundamental will the doubt ever legal binding be
for the first in the history the the fundamental and human be in this charter social rights included the same gentlemen have if the traditional human and traditional principles that is in not few list the fundamental the a member the case
for all countries the to the european union want join is this charter also the expression the our common values what the social rights the is the for the countries a clear signal that they the the social standards must answer
the charter means also the beginning the the constitutional process where the parliament as often the has the already are some mainly and government the this not that agree
with the charter the the fundamental the the first stone the the a constitutional process and a future european constitution
that must for us a sufficient reason are to the charter good to approve also already are a large number the the important rights the the parliament rightly for the people in europe has called not in this charter included
the is incomprehensible that the right the a honest salary not in the charter the the just incomprehensible was the strong opposition against the into the the right the a individual subsistence the work and the housing
to the cornerstone the a european constitution to can be must this charter in the future still be supplemented
that can us however not prevent with conviction this first step to do
i hope that the parliament already says the today only yes against the charter the the fundamental there in the next weeks there not doubt on will let there that the the the council calls that this charter legal binding the and that the the citizens also access to the european court the justice its
i hope that the parliament this demands in are resolution for nice with a large majority force will pressing
finally thank i my corapporteur for the many and  work that he has done and the parliament for are support
mrs the president how the time also if think on the mandate the the european council the cologne the is in any case quite surprising that the convention for the drafting the the draft this mandate fully has know to role
we were for a extremely complex task the into the fundamental rights and freedoms as the there within the constitutional traditions the the member but also within the general principles the the legislation the the union
to my opinion is the convention the managed a healthy balance to achieve between selfrestraint and ambition
we are not further has than the treaties us fabric but have the the influence the this treaties to the effort  by the relationship between the citizens and the union for the first clear visible to make
some will disappointed are that the charter not further has can more but we must not forget that the a compromise is that in the pots the the convention is peloponnesian and that the a balance represents between competitive political trends nationalities and cultures
this balance necessary a broad consensus within the convention and the broad consensus must there also are within the european parliament
the parliament has a important role played the the wording the the charter
we have there benefit the had that we strong the the process involved are been and this charter will when the once solemn is become the citizens the we represent the good to with particularly because article member rules that the union in this times the amongst european integration the european fundamental under protection can offer
mrs the president gentlemen presidents gentlemen members first like i i behalf the council with the the the the condolences the the european parliament the the family the the victims the the terrible accident the kitzsteinhorn in austria
the does i particularly many pleased that i here with you this fine draft the the fundamental the the european union length can discuss before your parliament are final position on this text its we have already twice the mind can exchange on this text
first have we the october on a debate on this text held in the framework the a oral question the by president napolitano the the commission constitutional affairs was the then is this issue the october the the item the when i you the results the the informal council the and october in biarritz presented
the debate the today is however not unnecessary repeat
the is precisely particularly important because your parliament today a decision will take accordance the conclusions the the council the cologne will the together with the council and the commission the text present during the european council the nice the on less than a month will place
the require not speech that the here to a very important political decision is because we as the european citizens again the the important the this initiative can point
i like the both rapporteurs the members duff and voggenhuber praise my for their speech the just from the position the the commission constitutional affairs can i made that this you article the before text the to take and therefore your president mandate to to to behalf you the charter in nice to present with the presidents the the council and the commission
as you know is your position line with that the the state and government the during the european council the biarritz unanimously and deserve the charter have approved i like you therefore behalf the council ask this position the the commission constitutional affairs to follow and like this like a number reasons propose
in the view the the presidency the the council is this charter in two respects a success
in first body because the however method the the convention the is up from members the the european parliament national members personal representatives the the state and government and members the the european commission what this last the like i here the mr vitorino welcome the already are expertise in service the this initiative has the
the diversity and quality the the competition members have i i now contributed the the wealth the this text
the convention has the transparent way and in consultation with the citizens its work done and the often use made the the internet i think this a particularly good matter
also has the convention if part the its work hearings taken with the large european ngos programmes the social partners the us continent and what very important is for the future the countries
this openness and transparency have their results effective and have active contributed the the gradual improvement the the draft through the different versions the are up we can this see that the final version the the text good is
given the experience the we with the convention have gained think i that we this method also in the future can follow i like not say that this the only right is but he can certainly a contribution make the a transparent europe that better to are citizens listening
with particularly during us previous debate have members the this parliament indicated that they in the future like the this experience want build
itself doubt i there not the that there the a appropriate opportunity will arise to the this method use to make
the second and most success has the the the result that the convention has achieved the charter is all a clear and good organised document
now i preparations commended for the next igc dispose i of still more aware the document is record and clear and is the meet the the ensure and expectations the our citizens
the is a short text the over fifty articles divided on six chapters the titles the this chapters ensure for the right during and would perhaps the new orange for europe can be dignity  equality solidarity citizenship and justice
the charter is also a very coherent text
the authors have the a important but not simple to role evident demand met they were namely one considered not itself ex nihilo law the to to and strictly from to to the all the force having fundamental in the union but hand also to this rights the to summarise if dynamic and  principles
the large force the this charter is however are content of am i convinced
in the text be the fundamental as described in the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human largely again confirmed
with the  have the authors the the text there constantly for interpreted that there differences existed between one the law the the european court for the rights the the human that responsible is for the compliance the that treaty and hand the law the the court the justice the the european communities they have to with particularly time the text the the treaty the the council the europe adopted when the enough was
with the general provisions the in article member the that as this charter rights contains the  with rights the are guaranteed by the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the fundamental freedoms the content and scope that same are if the what there by mentioned treaty the be granted
i think that the authors the the charter there the this way in are managed the opportunity the any derogations in law between the court the luxembourg and the court the strasbourg so possible to avoid
now we just the  there the the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the fundamental freedoms celebrated have think i that we that can confidence that the judges the the both system their dialogue will continue they will there doubt for ensure that the europe the the human a europe the two speeds the as by some here the feared
course is the charter fortunately not only a text which the already existing rights again confirmed and recognition be
in the charter are many new rights included the not in the government treaty prevent
this new rights from continue from the developments in our societies or the now is to the development the the technology the the the new  or the increasing complexity the our administrative and public systems
the is with particularly the important that the citizens example know that the union the cloning the people for reproductive purposes in already are forms prohibits and that they its citizens protection the their personal data guarantees
the does i further course many pleased that in the text many attention the spent the the economic and social rights
this was because the wish the france but also the many other member the european parliament and many national members this does the presidency the the council many pleased
the this point is the charter because a strong text the presented because innovative to are and sufficient invitations from to  and to lead to the consolidation the the european social model which we so gentlemen attach
the is the large important that in the charter a chapter with if title solidarity is included
i like in this respect president herzog all praise my because he is i i the driving force behind this chapter
the understanding solidarity the because the best the importance the the european social model again without result the european europe not possible is
in the charter the this solidarity guaranteed through the right the free education the right the information and consultation the the workers within the company the right the collective negotiations and collective action with including the strike also already was the not simple this point in the text the to take the right the protection the obviously unreasonable resignation the right the social security and the ban the child
i like further consider the article which clearly the the that men and women right are in this article the because clarification that this equality the all areas must be guaranteed and that this principle not from that measures maintained or taken be which specific measures be affected the benefit the the undertaking gender
what the the confirmation the the social rights can this text in are whole as be given if the most collective step forward the the eu ever has the content are this in the charter included rights because the large important
there can moreover the few critical comments be placed the the content the the charter
some lacking the text because he the political choices the the those the a liberal europe would reflect they express criticism the the fact that the charter only could be adopted if there there was the consensus within the convention
i objective here the the recent statements the a number mainly european members the want that the charter review the
what the method the consensus the like i in remind to that the convention itself its procedures has the without only external coercion also is this method particularly suitable for a convention since its composition very diverse is
i am that convinced that the present members the the convention the here the floor will to this will concur
personally think i that this method certainly has contributed the the in my view balanced and ambitious text
the european alliance the trade has indicated that the text in are view a number shortcomings some as the there example not referred the the right the a minimum
like like i here a number aspects with the to this issue again clarify the charter had if objective to the fundamental in one text under to to
you can this regret but i think that this perhaps later the the item will to in the initial  was the mandate the the convention indicated
the basis the this mandate if the convention not whole new social rights up i am there however the convinced that this in a later stage the can done
the charter is moreover not the only initiative the social area the the french presidency the the union
contrary the presidency as the promote the a more solidarity europe if one the are priorities
as you know has the presidency the basis the the conclusions the the council the lisbon the initiative taken to the up the a social agenda with the measures the the european union the next years must take to in the existing needs to for this applies in the particularly for the qualitative and quantitative improvement the the employment and the promote the the social cohesion
the charter and the social agenda must other the to complement and must the social dimension a central place transferring in the european europe
the presidency and if i i not mistaken the european institutions are welcome with the general position that the european alliance the trade has welcome the alliance stressed because the the between the charter and the social agenda and the the that the by the state and government adopted proposal the the convention a important step forward means in the to to a social europe the the citizens
this is a important positions which i very welcome am
to this to to support have the state and government the text the the charter approved and will they him will in nice hope also adopt
everyone has are pleased expressed on the balance that the authors the the charter have found the presidency take the than also not desirable that the debate again the opened and i think that your rapporteurs there also as on think
i am finally fore the a issue that already discussed is namely the validity the the charter i am good aware the the repeated wish the your rapporteurs to the charter if preamble to let must the a constitutional treaty where i as you know also favour the am
i like you there however the point that we account must the with the current circumstances the european council has because in biarritz must see that the majority the the member now in any case still not like discuss on the inclusion the this charter in the treaties
this issue can formally therefore only after the summit the nice the the item be the i can you however assure that the french presidency intends is this issue in the conclusions the the european council the nice to let into
different people including with particularly members the this parliament have proposed to in article the the treaty on the european union explicitly to refer to the charter the the fundamental in the treaty the moreover also already referred to the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human
this people have stressed that there a paradoxical situation the if in the treaty not reference the made the a new text the specific for the european union the application is but the the a already existing text the by the council the europe is up
you know that i personally for this proposal open i and the even support i like this here again stress
the presidency has during are bilateral contacts however must see that a number member this proposal not desirable eight
i like the european parliament there moreover the point that there yesterday the initiative the the presidency a debate has place within the group the this issue preparing
this group has indicated that the debate still not fully is concluded from can be secondary that a number governments the perhaps still can let inspiration by a clear positions the the european parliament if whole
i doubt there not the that this clear and coherent text will must if the  where the union as particularly many need the had
behalf the presidency the the council like i you therefore again encourage to the charter the the fundamental the to take so we the text will in nice joint solemn can present
i am that convinced that the presentation one the the important moments the this european council the conclude the the french presidency will forms
the the mrs the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen the directly elected members the the european parliament represent million citizens the the european union a the their most tasks there the europe and the european unification closer the the citizens to to
the is therefore good that the european parliament the the drafting the a charter the fundamental the the european union the essential important has adopted and this close and constructive has involved
the european parliament was with members in the convention for the fundamental represented that was a large success
positive is that the groups united have action from the present result that that the good was the european parliament close the the matter to involve
i thank the our representatives in the convention under leadership the the mr méndez the vigo
ladies and gentlemen any member the the european parliament that the the charter has involved has a large contribution made the the rapid but precise and adopt implementation the the heavy task which the european council the cologne the convention had responsible
behalf our group thank i already my mr programmes from my group but in the particularly also the mr ingo vicepresident the the parliament that he our work has coordinated
our the thank is however from to all members the the convention in the particularly the mr herzog former  the the federal germany and president the the convention i wish him also many  to
our group is the with exception the the british delegation with the charter agree
the draft is balanced and has if european consensus already the many support can count
the charter can however not the all wish meet
that applies for each compromise
europe can only progress and itself be if we all to a good result want contribute
for the charter the the fundamental is that the case
the charter the the fundamental is continue from a large number european and national treaty
the join the the the  and moral heritage the us continent and the the affirming and universal values the human dignity and the freedom equality and solidarity
the charter based the the foundations the democracy and law the charter the the human if individual central
the is the basis for the citizenship the the union and for a area the freedom safety and justice as the the for transparency
the citizens to a clear picture the their fundamental the institutions and bodies the the european union know now clear what rights they the regard the the people in europe certainly in eight must take
this charter is a large success and can as a large european newspaper the the september mentioned the speak the europe be
during the debate on the summit the biarritz in the plenary sitting the october the this year i i there with the to the future the the charter already the out that the to the future the the european union itself is
mrs the president with our permission request the european parliament you on few weeks the the european summit in nice together with the presidents the the council and the commission the charter the to announce
the convention event in nice can however only a step are
the european union is today many more than a economic community
if we representatives and committed the the citizens in the european union and very europe the unification the us continent the ambitious and committed way want continue can the formal proclamation only a first step are
the european party favour there united for the charter the the fundamental as quickly possible in the treaties the to take so the also for the people in the european union direct legal the
behalf the european party say i however very clear that we not only what the conditions for the enlargement the the european union but also what the charter the nice the a ambitious result expect behalf the members the the european party request i the president the the council therefore again in nice to fight for a plan for the integration the the charter the the fundamental in the eu
we wish the french presidency the the council the success
that would also a common success for the european parliament and all people in the european union are
applause
mrs the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner colleagues there are in the history the the european integration moments the if important  can be as this is there a the
approval the the charter by the parliament is again a step in the direction the the degree the the dream and plans the our fathers i put in remind that there in for the first on a statement the the rights the the human is about
that was the the congress the the european movement in den hague the was a important the to the european treaty for the rights the the human the the council the europe
now is the far that we within the european union can the that we a community the values have that we actually content have given the the in the treaty the the union recognised european citizenship and that we our area have consolidated not only if a internal market but also if a area the justice which the fundamental rights the the human be recognised
we are the elections entered with a manifesto which priorities were a the the main of was the promotion the a charter the the fundamental the way the the rights and economic social and cultural rights for all citizens the the european union
from the european council the cologne under the german presidency the chancellor schröder is proposed a convention in to to for the drafting the the final charter the the fundamental the council by are mandate and competition a former president the the federal roman herzog to president the this convention
i like this today like stress because the is not as that the work specific by a certain political family is done
the german presidency the time deserves this certainly a compliment the is clear that we all us play will must contribute the the achieve the the fundamental values
also in the european parliament have we that i i done
i i my admiration can express for the work that the mr méndez the vigo if president the the delegation the the european parliament has done
also mr great berès deserves many praise because they was the the head the the delegation the the group the the european social i think that we all proud should are the the achieved success
the is with right a common success
today the day is europe the something more than a common market
also have we now on a document that if point for a future constitution can must however despite all efforts can we still not to to
for the summit the nice must we still a important step to i objective the the last point that by the president the the council is mentioned namely the into the the charter in article the the treaty
from the the personal support the the presidentinoffice president the the council are there other factors the into in the treaty can facilitate
the most state and government properly now to our political family others although not but are the for into the the charter and for a democratic europe
the charter provided the european union a essential legitimacy if community the values that is course the the the important
our governments must in nice specific results for the citizens to achieve the institutional issues are course important but the president the the council and the commissioner know but already to good how difficult this the the public opinion are to sell
the charter means also a stages the the criteria the copenhagen the we for the negotiations the fundamental important consider
what the the countries which we now in negotiations are means the course also that they the us certain guarantees to the is therefore not only but a statement
the is a element that in the process excellent the only is my group remains than also the opinion that the the the essential important is that there in article member the the treaty a reference to the charter the included
the president the the council has the this weekend pressure with the next sitting i like him a message for the sitting give so this through the ministers the foreign affairs the the state and government ends
the is to the next if the charter during the european council the nice not the this way in the treaty can be included am i afraid that the for the european parliament difficult the are approval the the revision the the treaties to attach
the president the the council must this i i positive message the are colleagues transfer because there is still sufficient time to the charter in article the the treaties the to take
after the summit the nice can we on the european constitution to talk
time is the especially the important that we this stage consolidate
that is us proposal
the sv mrs the president to to start like i behalf the group the rapporteurs and all others congratulate the the the convention have involved
the is has that the the a new and exemplary way with european issues can deal a way the better work than the intergovernmental conference namely a democratic and transparent method with full control and participation the the citizens
that the european cooperation not only based is the economic agreements is already a number times to the the
that is the last year additional clear become
the turnout the xenophobic and antidemocratic movements very the issue the the european common standards and values the the propose
same with the enlargement the the power the the european bodies on the citizens is the the important to borders to to the this power
in the draft are the citizens and are rights the a unique way in the centre
there are course also political compromises closed
the was give and take but there is a whole the common and modern rights that the european common standards and values clear 
because there a certain concerns there is the the important to that to point that the charter a supplement the and not competitor is the the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human
therefore is the the important to already in nice the legal possibility for the eu to create to the treaty the the council the europe to sign
the the summit the nice will the charter be approved in the form the a political statement
the must not continue the a ceremony with meaningless statements
that type things are the citizens tired
the must clear be that the the charter moral binding take
after the summit must also the swedish presidency as quickly possible the procedures the for the future position the the charter with if objective to the after few changes binding to explain and part to make the a future european constitution
the fr mrs the president gentlemen mr programmes the charter the the fundamental that a very important step the way to the european europe is has to many debates led
some as the charter if a success while the others has disappointed
many saw the charter if a possibility for europe to last more to can offer than only a trade they hoped to can break with the amounts liberal idea and the basis to can to for a europe the the citizens
as was there the the usual intergovernmental method from and was there a convention the the original way was up there were public debates held and everyone could the texts the a website consult
the transparency could however the democratic deficit not make as were the ngos programmes only five minutes the time to their opinion to therefore the moreover rarely in recital was taken
there are the few progress made but this roads not the against the restrictions
we have a number weeks fight must make before the willingness was to the strike in the text the to take
right the work is changed in right to to work
the right the health social security housing and a minimum is in the text not for or fact only in the context the the 
the press is not longer guaranteed they the respect
the right the minorities the only but too mentioned
the distinction between europeans and inhabitants the third countries the confirmed as what the the free movement that in the treaty the amsterdam is included and the right the family that in the international right the recognised
often considerations also the european rights over the national that applies with particularly for the political rights
what is there on the our without principles the the universality indivisibility and  the the right
why the there not about on the european citizenship that the heart is the this europe which all citizens right hear to are
this text has than also a bitter bitter
in the charter enjoys again the liberal europe the prefer over the social europe the the citizens what attitude must we now the relation the this text the to take
in the text be because only the existing rights confirmed the charter offers therefore nothing news
the before charter will for the european citizens not essential important represent
the offers only a added the the expectations the the citizens the however not meet into
also provides the text not in their needs what the fundamental the must we us the to questions or we pleased must take with the the lowest lowest if model for the human in europe
we must not pleased take with this minimum charter which the european social obviously satisfied are
the charter must not by the french presidency be abused to the failure the the igc to conceal
during the european council the nice in december will the civil the mobilise and are voice make to the to give that the a charter like that the citizens the europe actually guarantees offers we must this actions support
we must this forestalled text not accept but demands that the work the the convention after nice be continue with new procedures and a broad social debate
the is here because to the future the our democracy our rights and our freedoms
the the mrs the president i label the charter the the fundamental good the is a very important political project for the future the the european integration
in the first place guarantees the the rights the the citizens the the bodies and institutions the the european union
in the second place deficiencies the a you the in the protection the the fundamental the the people in the union
in the third place guarantees the charter the already existing level the protection the the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human in the union and is the even still what further
in the fourth place is the charter from the the indivisibility the the civil and political human and social fundamental that think i very important
if member the the convention i i for still wider social rights worked in the particularly for the conditions the the right the work and the a minimum given the the existing social charter had the rights in this charter must be included
however am i the with the general assessment the the european alliance the trade agree the charter the fundamental is despite the settlements interpretation the the social rights a important step in the promotion the a social europe and a europe the the citizens and offers in compared with the current situation a added
mrs the president in the particularly with the view the nice have we now a broad public debate on the text the the charter need the citizens must the charter can approve
i am favour the a european referendum on the charter we would than last on a democratic  for the european integration by the citizens itself have
mrs the president there the often large gentlemen adopted the the sign the documents signatures be often 
that is happened with the charter the the social fundamental the the workers that in strasbourg during a european council was signed the seemed that that during this council the problems with the to the protection the the dignity the workers were resolved
when was the disappointment in maastricht has britain the social protocol not signed and therefore the lots rhetoric on the fundamental important the the charter the the social fundamental the the workers the with by hand on us was  
good let we try to prevent that same happening with the charter the the fundamental
except signatures is this also specific daily political commitment need the all countries and all political movements
there can not amendments the the charter be tabled that means a democratic deficit what us to brings the charter just as in biarritz was concluded not if legal binding to as
if we amendments the the charter could submit if we for view did that in the charter duties present are and rights to little attention to would the easier are the charter is weak what the the defence the the natural family the protection the the child the satisfactory not attention the the need the new broad information to regulate the discriminatory  the relation the public schools the satisfactory the environmental not attention the the health and the rights the animals the is vague on the protection the consumers and join not from that food the the health serious damage can seriously in the trade be the
also contains the charter political gaps the problem the the political refugees the there example not in dealt
therefore are we the opinion that the charter if fundamental only the important is to a debate in the to to a debate that useful is for the future but that the still must develop that time with the construction held must be
let we this charter if a fundamental take and us joint commit therefore vote we for the recommendation and the the alleanza alleanza the in for a democratic debate that the charter in the next months must make and credibility and that time with the debate on the accession and the new european citizenship must be held
the fr mrs the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes with this charter show the union and our member the for the another time not in the to the produce the a  text the is a document which only intent are
as you know is this charter the not few legal based the text provides in not only body that can ensure the the principles and rights the in the charter are expressed
the is again a materialise text the call the the mr barón and others to in article or the the treaty to this charter to refer will the this situation nothing change
the  has clear made that europe not in the is are important principles after to life during this affair has europe because outside the treaty to bilateral measures affected since the on the article and the the treaty community measures not possible were
this is however still not everything
in cologne is the council the the  idea has to the dog the parliament in this case a brusque to to throw he has this charter however and us parliament has the as we the last time still more see the the brusque minds and has there the as in  that the impression the that the here to a historic event is
the most issues be however not in this concise document the the french presidency dealt namely the issue on the composition the the commission and the issue the the votes the the vote within the council us parliament that the always strong right the the weakest and weak the the those used still  methods and offers not answer the the planned destruction the the commission
the parliament accepts because that the commission the into to a type secondclass council or to the institution the the decisions effect the the council the itself a still more body the
the the agenda the the summit the nice the this intergovernmental outside the in the texts is anchored you can him accept and you are fibre the great meaningless texts landfill
the is moreover deplorable that the small member the the european union continue to the their demand the one commissioner per member this demand will only but a further disintegration the the commission to result have
we prepare a murder the the commission for this without is however also a form the suicide since the commission the proposals the the council the previous week has supported
we can this together regret or simply our view the and in all  this great but in fact meaningless event celebrating
the is but that you know how we ensure are
or we now for or against this charter vote or us the vote abstained the change all nothing the the situation
the da mrs the president the is hardly to believe that the mr dupuis and i the on same text have
the vote on the charter conceals plans for the first part the a constitution the the socalled united states the europe
the charter the although only with a special constitutional conference in in the treaty included but with the formal signature by the commission the council and the parliament the the european court the justice there a new  the and the member the the court has already informed that the court the by the charter will let inspiration
the member the the commission in the convention in turin know the document legal gentlemen to
the assertion the the danish government that the text nothing news contains is than also absurd
what must we than with the text
course add the charter new things to the the existing right as is there example the ban the discrimination the national minorities what a positive matter is
there is a new formula written for the positive discrimination the women and there are new rules up on the cloning the protection the personal data and the right the access the documents the problem is not the content but the underlying idea
the like this charter namely let concept the the national constitutions and the european statement the the rights the the human
the european court the justice will us new court and constitutional court be also for all affairs on fundamental and human the will also the highest body be for the interpretation the the european statement the the rights the the human
in the convention i i amendments tabled to the charter under the authority the the national constitutional  and the court for the rights the the human to to
they were however not adopted and the that exactly the constitutional intention the the charter
unfortunately mrs the president must i therefore against the charter vote
the the mrs the president first like i my friend the mr méndez the vigo you thank for the fact that he in my place the delegation has want lead because i the same at for the parliament a conciliation had lead
the convention has excellent work made
mr the minister the result the a picture the the spiritual foundations the europe we can this see what europe in are express being 
there was on many new rights for children elderly and disabled about also interesting think i the new right the free take that in the practice a type ban the socialism means
you you however not socialists more but social
i think the also important that in the preamble very clear on the  foundations the about who are roots does can because not grow and who not can grow can also not flourish
we want a their prosperous growing europe we must than also on our roots speak
how must the now further
in the future must the charter the the fundamental part be the a european constitutional treaty the not constitution so clear the that the european union not the is but its own way is the states retain their predominance
only the states can the treaties the the usual way by statute change therefore speak we on a constitutional treaty and not on a constitution
if we credible want are can we for the development the the european union not simple the concepts the the  the the e and e century accept but must we our own concepts develop
we say than also rightly not the but  commission in place the government constitutional treaty in place the constitution who like that europe fails must the concepts clear define
if we want succeed have we a  europe need we want that europe fails
the concepts must clear be defined they must precisely are just as the principles and powers
if the conditions fulfilled are can we the the next european elections in possibly a constitutional treaty present as can a whole to the to that the confidence the the citizens enjoys and also the science can convince
clear concepts are the the basis the success
applause
the fr mrs the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes will the there on the draft voted and i think that you the basis the the result the this important vote this charter behalf our institution will can present
after the europe the the internal market will there perhaps will last there are the a europe the the rights the understanding citizenship in the european union is a relatively new concept
as you perhaps still know is the here to a initiative the dirty  the this fine understanding if first established
since has the a development human and is the to the imagination to speak
to the date thought we the citizenship the a single and a passport with this fine charter which we the rights have let into the the understanding now also content
the charter is a fine text because the accessible clear and precise is formulated you would think that the to a drafting is and that is now also exactly our intention
or the also a drafting the is moreover still to see also for women is this text a step forward since he neutral and therefore not in the  is up
what the content the should we proud are the this charter the is because to a balanced text
the first right is the right the dignity
we can because not deny that in the e century behind the understanding dignity all rights underlying and that this rights a alone whole forms
i think the the the rights the the individual the rights the the citizens but also the social rights
i know that in cologne a difficult mandate is granted
some were the a balanced  while others the inadequate were we have there in any case optimum use the made
some members in this parliament including members the my own political colour in the sense sense more dissemination regret the that there in the text not about the on a minimum and the right the housing and that there in the general provisions not explicitly the referred to the social charter the the council the europe and the community
however like i this members ask the text seriously to take
when i morning to a number speeches deaf was i the impression that not everyone the whole text actually read had and the whole the the scope the the charter has let our
late i briefly what say on the scope
i like the members the find that this text the the area the the social rights not far enough is invite to agree what better to look to the validity the the existing texts in europe the the area the the social rights
the charter is in fact up if a text the the a binding nature can be for
the is many further than the texts which we us in political respect identify but the despite the fact that they their basis in the common policy find the citizens not real rights their where a court a judgement the would can base
we can not deny that this charter to life must be the or in the words the  lalumière launched must be
to will we closely must work and ensure must ensure that the text the as broad possible support the this parliament can count
i hope that this the case will are everyone will mobilised must be the european members the national members the council the governments and course also the social civil that us has times the the up the this text
i like briefly what say on the validity the the text mr the presidentinoffice president the the council you spoke just on the work the the igc the night
not all governments consider the although desirable that there a reference in article the included but i had the the impression that there the a majority for a such reference would can everywhere
the status the this charter start or end not with this reference
the charter will if preamble must act for a constitution there must however still a long institutional way be made
the this at to we to a reference in article
this the expressed in the mandate that we our representatives have visited
for us parliament is the adoption the this charter the result the a longterm fight the we in are made in our resolutions the drafts the spinelli and the  for the european union have we this objective always for view had
i hope that will a as large possible number members for the text will vote so your voice mrs the president during the presentation the the charter strong will contained
the sv mrs the president the charter contains many welcome points
the right the a properly administration what mrs malmström also already mentioned is a the the most successes the made are
that right there in other international documents and in many constitutions the the member
the right the a transparent administration is a the the most specific improvements the the charter our citizens to offer has
the charter contains also a opening the favour the the rights the minorities because the wording in article that the union the cultural religious and linguistic diversity must to respect
this respect in combination with the ban the discrimination creates a basis for a improvement the the position the minorities in the future
the method is managed
he is such managed that the prime the finland in are speech last friday this method mentioned if a way to ideas to the to to for a the hands having european constitution
this think i the large important
the is however also the important that the eu the with the the conventions
the two are hand with other linked
to finally i i with s noted that also the children the the item to
i hope that that a reason is for commissioner vitorino to measures to take so the eu the the summit in the autumn with a contribution can to for the position the children
i i also with many proud noted that a member the my group in my country   a very large role has played the the the the this charter
i am the opinion that he has contributed to the clarity the mrs berès mentioned
the charter is clear and president and a good example for many other constitutions
my congratulate and thank to from to the mr méndez the vigo and already those the the this document have work
i like this people not only thank but they also let know that i magnets the them am
they have a accommodating example work done
for us is a text the record represents where the in europe to is and what rights we if citizens the this tremendous union uphold
the vote i however sad that the british conservatives the spectrum have closed in the opposition against the idea to the institutions accountability for violations the the rights the the citizens the the union to give
the is sad that the party the churchill and   as deeply is sank where we there least still for try to ensure that the institutions the the union the not present if the tyrants the brussels but if bodies the according article the under the obligations the for all institutions the the union binding are point the british conservatives the charter  the
because i still nothing the them heard i can i still not exactly assessing how freedom the mr blair are land will give in the express the support the this magnificent project
i hope that the mr martin the the as has used for this convention are colleagues that will convince that the time is to this charter not only the to take but the also to part to make the our legislation the binding to make for those the us govern not just a officially charter but a binding part the the treaties
perhaps is reference in article the best what we time can do but that is only the beginning
the is not perfect document that know we all
nothing in the life is perfect but the witness also not the dawn when we certain rights set and there then not effective the ensure that they be respected
i i given that there in the charter articles are the the have the the fact that someone innocent is unless the opposite is proven and on the principles the the legality and the right the defence
as i night i said and i say the here today again are there all in the union what that the still too shortcomings and sometimes because we as like the the area the justice and police with other want work forget we how important the is to prevent that innocent if sectors the a war against the crime of the passive victims be
we must this rights not only accept and they to part the our legislation make but there also for ensure that they really to life for our citizens
mrs the president i am i there aware the aware that the very important is us in a text from to speak for a community the human values also know i that the for the first is that the human values in a such text the same level be the if the civil political and social rights
also think i that the for the first new method the the convention which a better information and more transparency central were a innovative nature has
further gives the charter however only but strife in i the
there there because a large difference between the initial ambitions and the result
course can we the gentlemen the a specific article stress and the real progress welcome by a number new rights the the the with the development the our societies to confirm and the most fundamental again to ratify
in a number articles be even rights recognised the never earlier are down this applies with particularly for the rights the social area
i like here however not list the positive and negative points give mrs the president recently by you still the that a glass half are can are but also half know
the is to a believe on the charter if whole what the the followed method and the ambitions the are shown
then must we us the next questions to to meets the charter the the demands and expectations the the european citizens
i i the text a number time through and am the opinion that he good accessible is
i i to the arguments the my colleagues listened but i the my position that there different very dangerous lack in the charter are and that we by from to to the the the lowest lowest the very little shaky
the convention is innovative but we must not to the explosive twiddled across work
the european citizens be still always to little informed if we they asked had to a contribution to make the the the the the charter what moreover absolutely had must done than had the content there doubt very otherwise looked
the is never to late to our mistakes to restore
nice would not the  the the charter must are that like say the place where the text complacency the presented but the point for a as broad possible social debate on this very important issue the the fundamental
since the decision on the charter from political view as important is think i together with others in this parliament that the now to early is to us there today on from to speak
mrs the president the resolution the the european parliament on the charter the the fundamental is the same unclear situation based if the work the the convention
in both cases the us because asked a text good to approve without that clear is what he must
is the to a political statement
is the a supplement the the treaty
is the to the first part the a future constitution
we will probably only after nice a answer the this questions to
by this uncertainty is the difficult to in to vote with the work the the convention now has completed or to today our voice from to to
some members to the reassure with the idea that a positive voice not obligations with the of the charter is now because not more than a statement
this members committed a mistake
if this text if such the adopted the he through the law the the court the justice a binding nature this is a important issue which i still will back
in this process am i by two aspects fascinated
one will the the adopted charter lead to a standardised europe that the the majority part the the members in this parliament significance  and that the electorate absolutely not wish
the law the the court the justice the basis which the rights will closely interpreted will be will in whole europe the uniform way be applied result of is that the national democracies not autonomous decisions more can take
you will will not more can say gentlemen members that you this not was
the subject which we today debate is whole outside the obstructing the the union during the council the cologne is the there excellent in managed to everyone the to to the the idea that the here to a competence the the national parliaments is
slowly but certainly deprived the council this national parliaments already their powers this institution was the help by the convention the there excellent in is managed to confusion to create
the basis the the current treaties can therefore the be that here a illegal debate the held this is a bad omen for a europe that claim the fundamental to want failure
to the reason think i and i address i in the particularly to the presidency the the council that if the governments in nice the charter if political statement adopt they before a introductory statement must make which they stress that the definition and development the the human in all cases only is reserved the the national parliaments
mrs the president this year is the fifty year ago that the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the fundamental freedoms was closed
this charter makes the i the impression the  of to are the calls questions the on the legal framework
but how can someone  be without first the death to be condemned
that is are unnecessary absurd
the charter recognises freedom the religion without restrictions
in the italian constitution the this freedom contained by the good offends in the treaty by the rights the others the public item
are  or  hebrew example allowed or not
that is absolutely not clear
political given there the recognition the the right the selfdetermination the the peoples and there there a clear definition the the natural family
and the finally this procedure which the not allowed is amendments in to must not only by other parliaments but also not by the european parliament not only the the charter but also not the the decision responsibility the the one on the rights the the citizens the and deny the the other on the rights the the representatives the the citizens namely the the members the not agree a amendment can submit
therefore  i i not at in this charter also already am i a favour the the europe the the citizens i will than also not for vote
mrs the president the the question or the european parliament must help the the solemn proclaim the the charter is my answer simply no
the is really no good for
who must we with the statehood the this charter
the citizens the the member not because the most rights in the charter are as vague formulated that any player also the institutions look can to what him 
also is the not few way for in a good system the legal protection if the charter unfortunate legal binding would be
also the the document are with rights the nothing to make have with the correlate the the powers the the institutions
the charter is therefore especially at the the member but the have in their own constitutions or ruled already the necessary fundamental included
if additional guarantee for a good protection the fundamental is any member party the the european treaty the protection the the rights the the human
what can the charter in this form still add except serious confusion
according joseph andersson there the citizens in europe will earlier under a examine the protection than under a deficit
that am i the i with him agree
a examine the protection is just harmful if a deficit
the charter is  the a 
this would the european parliament if institution the the citizens not the that must work
the the mrs the president i was from the beginning favour the the charter the the fundamental
i i also still said that the legal binding had be
however am i the not agree with the changes  appreciation for the convention if instrument for future constitutional developments
apart the the here already mentioned content problems the the charter is the not sufficient members the national parliaments the the charter to involve to the the way the national parliaments not the the constitutional issues to must involve
the instrument the the convention must not the wrongly if a  ex  the the european union be as
still a comment for the president the the council if former member the a highest court can i you assure that the other  powers the different highest system doubt very quickly to picked justice will lead
we should that problem in not case from the view lose
mr the president with the vote the twelve at the we today a process the that in is started when approved the european parliament the draft for a treaty the the european union good
the charter the the fundamental is still a priority the the european parliament been the first has the parliament always already a document want have which the principles and values are mentioned the the europeans made
that is especially the large important now we the the beginning the a ambitious enlargement are
the second is the charter the the fundamental a essential factor for the development in the direction the a political union
the third and this is doubt the most reason mr the president will a charter the the fundamental the citizens more the feeling give that he part part the the european union
as the president the our group the mr poettering already has said will we for the charter vote
the charter the also the opinion the the parliament again as that in our  the march the
the charter is to the has with cooperation the a parliamentary delegation if president the this delegation thank i all  for their work involvement and aid during the last months
as a the the previous speakers already has said must we us make to information on the charter to spread the parliament is the if first the the turn
if we to the speeches the some members listen is the clear that this information more than ever need is
some speakers would first the charter agree must read before they here their everyone to do
mr the president still a few words on the consequences the the charter
i think that this debate fact not need is
i i is the reference to article course i am the opinion that the presidency the the council good note must take the the words the the mr barón barón
the president the the group the the most european governments represents has without statement the words said that the parliament in any case are group the revision the the treaty the nice not will approve if there in article not reference to the charter is
the charter will certainly consequences have irrespective or there a reference in the treaty is or not
the has even already the necessary consequences had
read you the report the the three point on the situation in austria there but the after the the the charter three time mentioned
that report is between august and september to the has when was the charter there still not
irrespective or the charter therefore in the treaties is included and in article member the mentioned or not is the do for the commission the my thank the commissioner vitorino for the many work that he for the creation the the charter has done the the parliament and the council mr the president the charter will certainly are the have or some members the the european parliament that now want or not
mr the president there are colleagues the here morning have said that this charter the a or other right not clear enough or at not reflect there are also colleagues the say that the not democratic or socialist or green enough is
the people in issue have however not understand where the the this charter to is this is a charter that rights in the unites the over the parties well
the is a document which existing european values the a modern and  way impartial are
everyone in this parliament the interested is in the development the the european union would the the must can find
in its excellent communication the the commission the and the mr moscovici has us there morning again the out the that this charter unique is because the rights political rights economic rights and social rights  and the the a way the the not only another charter the the area the human and fundamental where also the world does
the charter is according the commission also brought because the the has the affairs if bioethics genetic manipulation data and access to information
the is therefore a good step in the right direction and the convention and its president the mr méndez the vigo deserve than also our thanks congratulate
the large question the us currently costsharing reads what is the objective the the charter
for i must the charter three purposes
the is there first to against the citizens to can say europe is not simply but something that you can the is a community the you rights its the you guarantees the the you in certain circumstances protection offers
the second is the charter there to against the institutions to can say you has a duty the nongovernmental in this charter to the a certain way with the citizens to to to
if you legislation favour if you  done if you documents right must you the to the the the content the this charter
the third is there the message the existing member and  if you member the the the community into you to to a community the values
there are certain conditions which the the must the if the member the the european union like are or continue
that is a very clear message not only for the candidate but also for the current member
given the fragile political situation in a few member is this the enhance at for such important message
how will the charter used to be
i am the agree with colleagues the say that the court not over will to the a charter that solemn is become by the three institutions the commission the council and the parliament
the court will the the do the legal statements account the with this charter
that is a positive development and not negative as the mr bonde obviously the opinion is
the mr dupuis and even my own interest the european affairs have let subtext that they this a idle document find
i can that not accept
this is a large step in the european construction a step the the my support can count
mr the president gentlemen colleagues the is a good matter that there a charter is for europe that like say for the citizens the the union i say you this if federalist
there is a day that we us the the subsidiarity must base so we more freedom can achieve for the european peoples this applies also for my small people from fall d  that the federalism in italy and in europe always has 
course must to be stressed that the charter only a point is and certainly not the point
i like moreover say that the a good matter is that there in the chapter on equality about the on national minorities and cultural linguistic diversity
we must to to a real european constitution so we the linguistic minorities in international the can protect
mr the president the content the the charter had the better can are
the problem the the legal status that had now resolved can be in place the in a vague future
that we this two results not have can achieve mr the minister that we in nice not satisfactory results will achieve in terms the democracy and efficiency is because we unanimously had agree with all parts the the text
the behind and the  have again won the those the in the civil and in the institutions fighting for fundamental for everyone rights the a adequate and legal binding response are the new issues as the risk programmes the the science the rights the new citizens the right the a healthy environment etc
we are therefore again disappointed and dissatisfied
certainly we will for the charter vote but with the idea that the not the enthusiasm for europe and the involvement the the citizens will mobilise where we as such need the have the historic responsibility this to as usually the governments and some governments more than other
mr the president the is almost not to deny that the social policy the the member the the union since few years the harnessing by the economic and monetary policy by the  opportunities by pacts by the flexibility and uncertainty the contracts in name the a  market and the are   the competition
the gap between rich and poor the still wider and who already many has asking in name the the government devoted principles still more sacrifices the who little or nothing possession
by are constant references to national legislation and practices for the effective achieve the social rights danger the charter the the fundamental this hierarchy this mechanism the unfair  the wealth by a small group this the liberalism and trade based social model irreversible to make a social model that with a impressive speed  from the axle the the european social idea
this charter the the social rights means a step the relation the the legislation the many member precisely because the  can the if a means be used to the to change or to worse
the rights and political rights continue as rights if they not based are the real social rights in place the only but the written rights
the the end the this century seems the that that all fight for the hymn the deprived social classes for nothing is been and we nothing have learnt
we can us not illusions make that this charter a first step the way to a more based union is
with this charter have we the soil the the social policy for the future achieved
i hope the that the charter not in the treaties included will be and that the call to a fairer and actually solidarity europe in the civil in the unions and in the political parties still expectations will sound
mr the president gentlemen members this debate on the charter means a new important step the way to a more united and hope fairer and fairer europe
i will for this charter vote not much because i that convinced am that the the a correct and effective way will be applied but because the impossible is the not agree to are with the leading principles that
there are still strong doubts the say from comprehensible any i think the the countries the the community which the right the life only and only a fundamental is where human life from the conception without distinction the oppressed i think the the european consumer the according the charter so and such important new rights has and the who the this at the remain the mad cows be given capitalism that the enriched on the back the the poor i think the the workers in the factories the fact right have the a fixed jobs and who in name the the globalisation the the markets the right the a future the denied to their work on to places to a country where work cheaper is i think the the students and lecturers and the the right the education and i think the the  and outdated structures the countries the of culture gentlemen mr programmes i think the the freedom the and the right the expression and i think the already those the in european prisons are because their opinion not with the the the others corresponds i think the the right the shelter and the a appropriate quality i think the the young the in name the often  not agree more right have the love
on that everything and still more things concerned i i ensure but i voice however for the charter also if the a utopia is because the us all the a revolution asked the to to be implemented a ounce rational utopia need has
mr the president in the recommendation which this debate is the the parliament are approval the the charter the the fundamental the the european union
then request the are president and the president the the council and the the commission to the charter in nice officially the to announce
this charter has however clear to objective the still reinforced alliance between the european peoples to promote
according the corapporteur the mr duff is this a important step to improvement the the quality the the european integration
if representative the the english people therefore not the the european peoples can i only say that i not mandate i to the european integration to promote just blind if the government the the united kingdom that has the if the least really are inhabitants represents
in fact is the majority the the inhabitants the the united kingdom totally opposed against further integration
and therefore am i that if extremism democrat also i talking myself than also the this initiative and will against vote
the sv mr the president the charter makes existing rights visible and same be there for europe historic steps the
end is the debate agreed or the eu based must are the normal  principles
the charter deficiencies a  in the founded and increase the protection the the individual against violations by the european police authorities the fraud combat and authorities
although we currently in the practice already penalties impose lack there normal opportunities to in appeal to to against violations the the human the in rule not should lack
any individual women man worker and entrepreneur must protected be against any political and administrative violations the the side the the eu
here are not good arguments against in to to
someone the illegally the against by the legal the the union must right have the a judicial research
a extended europe with a strong competitiveness must based are the  principles
there is a broad political support need for the right the the individual the judicial research the violations
a area with million people can otherwise not function
the charter is a balanced and sound basis for the enlargement
there there many misunderstandings on the material content and the consequences that
this misunderstandings must be investigated
those the this need the have council i the to the statements in article to read and also the law to study the the both  the linked are the the charter
the charter will the judicial development in the eu influence and probably gradually the still more support to
i am the opinion that the court the must let influence by the provisions on the freedom the exercise the appeal entrepreneurship and the property
to finally like i our occasionally leader méndez the vigo the i thank
mr the president the proposal and the approval the the draft the the fundamental would a very broad consensus must find
the seems i that only opponents the the european union a on have to opposed to are the have we here heard
i understand the criticism not the those the find that the charter not everything includes what they the included had want see
probably there there for everyone the something the charter can because not the mirror the one party are but must the common reference forms for everyone the the a european citizens feels everyone the the differences and the pluralist society respects
could the better
i think the the already was the but because not everything what i i proposed is adopted
is the than better nothing to do
this charter not good to approve
certainly not
this charter i say the still agree makes the the union a community the is a step in the process the the constitutionalisation the the union the is the first international document that both new rights new political economic if social rights contains in agreement with the principle the the indivisibility the fundamental
i understand those not the say that the no to must that the only but town and fine words are
who that says know the history the the institutions not also explicit explicit  are fine words but they are the foundation the many normalised in us europe
the on the formulas if this articles have our courts in the during the times our fundamental guaranteed
let we the assertion that only power and money counted and already the other only words are the cynical  leave
no the words the our principles our values our fundamental defied have power and force if we they ignore if instruments the us social life
let we the charter therefore approve and the words seriously take we should not allow that they be banalities devalued neglected
if we want that governments they in eight take and judges they guarantee must we our rights seriously take
the sv mr the president i i long globalisation
the charter contains positive parts but also parts where i principle any against i
crucial was for i a call the the fastest growing progressive movement the europe the french  the the charter as if a instrument the  social a instrument for social step
 is to the conclusion that the charter a step back means in relationship to the already existing legislation the the member the un the european council and the international organisation
 is also to the conclusion that there simply the the the rights the the unions and is the opinion that the fact is to the ratify the the free movement the capital
if the fastest growing progressive movement from the country the the first democratic revolution france the not suspected can be the only form the scandinavian scepticism or something in the spirit as strong protests against the draft can i impossible for vote
the da mr the president i i further where the mr gahrton into is
i think the problematic that the the social rights alone and universal as and same consistent refers to national legislation and practice in the chapter that solidarity is
that  exactly the universal and affirming accompany the this rights the
this was a content aspect where i effort that had
i i however also effort with the construction the we now the established to
if we the human the european level want strengthen than must we energy invest in the strengthening the the role the the council the europe and must we the eu the treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the corresponding treaties on cultural and social rights let ratify in place the little the little a competitive system the to build what now happening
the council the europe represents because very europe all european countries
we are still but with fifteen
to finally is there the problem that the a constitution like make without support the the population
this will the number vote the the next european elections not do increase
mr the president the charter that the approval for us is is a work which we proud should are
for the first since the up the the european union is here the basis the a constitution a constitution for the supranational structure the the union is
the is to us believe a good document a document which we also if christian can say our standards and values are here good in back to find
the right the human dignity and the human integrity the good expressed
that applies also for the respect the family and life and the way which the rights the children elderly and disabled are formulated
as offers this charter a additional protection for the most vulnerable fellow in our european society and that is good
the charter offers also balance
addition the social rights the good are expressed find we now also the right the freedom the entrepreneurship and freedom the appeal back in the text
as is a good balance found between a number rights the usually by unions be stressed and rights the more by confederations and central and small be expressed
a third comment the i like make is on the rights the citizens from third countries
also this have we articles the citizens protect against discrimination example the the market
also that was a wish the our group
than the most strong part the the charter that is article the large antidiscrimination
that prohibits discrimination the sixteen areas
i consider the if the krone the this charter
this article will still often need will if we look to the developments and to discrimination racism and xenophobia the we in our member see
president the was a large honour to that to should work with the colleagues from the parliament and from the national parliaments to this charter the to to
we thank roman herzog and inigo méndez the vigo for their excellent leadership the the convention and we hope the i that this charter in nice the approved with the signature the our president nicole fontaine
let we especially hope that our european citizens often use will make the this charter if their rights be the
for the citizens is the for and we hope that they the in gratitude will accept
president the december i i in nice show the european  and the ngos have this called
only already from the  be people expect
this  is not demonstration against the charter
there seem also in this circles people to are the that think and the that perhaps would want but the have there nothing the understand
the demonstration is for a social and democratic europe for a europe the the citizens
the charter is a part the the change this to to the the dynamic to a strong and social europe
as you know have especially the social and economic fundamental my warm attention had
addition the echr must also the social charter the the council the europe if source and soil for the eu apply
know you what i from when previous week the report with the to the enlargement by prodi and verheugen was presented
that  this watchdog on the ratification the 
if you this a  addition the the the current member than that that they in any case the the point the the revised social charter the the council the europe worse score than the countries
that think i however very embarrassing
the new charter will also if the still not binding is are legal effect have
that has the court the justice the october in the last  clearly and ready indicated
the institutions the the charter now solemn to sign must the however not only the the judges leave
to to start must they a reference in article the the eu into
there must a road be ones to the binding inclusion the the articles the the charter in the treaty and there must  to  independent experts and 
the council the europe has addition the court for the human also many experience with such forms the monitoring where we the can build
already with already must clear are that nice not the point is the the charter but the beginning
fundamental the heart the europe the  the secretarygeneral and  remains the next time very topical
this to we in nice the streets for the
president social fundamental individual rights and environmental be in the existing national constitutions not mentioned or take the a to modest place in
some those the a european constitution or the a charter if step the way round see the the possibility to the behind in one blow way to work
there there also other those the a european constitution
they want a  that especially the current european union describes and future developments to one european superstate justifies without that the inhabitants the europe there any new right the can sense
the first intention support i the second i i the
the draft the the fundamental the the european union is a unclear compromise between the two conflicting views which the second prevails
for some rights means the even a step back
therefore is this document not ready for decisionmaking
the short term is the many important that the european union the unites the the already existing european treaty for the rights the the human the the council the europe
the draft can time must if a interesting freelancing for parties unions environmental churches and many other groups in the member and candidate the the union on the future the the cooperation between the european peoples
the the mr the president ladies and gentlemen power requires control
the european institutions have power in the important the the citizens must we the power to
the existing gaps in the european protection the the fundamental must urgent be loophole
on the question or the union not just if the member to the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human must join the since many years discussed
the am i that the union that to a number reasons not has done
from the text the the charter that we today the hope with a large majority will approve that clear that this charter for more and modern protection the the fundamental will ensure than accession to the treaty to protection the the rights the the human would have done
scarcely a third the the charter there from guarantees the from the treaty to protection the the rights the the human are adopted
the the part is further the the area the the political rights the the citizens the the union the economic and social rights and burden but not least the for the future important issues the the environment health and consumer
to really effective to are must the charter european right be
today do we only a few step the a still long way
the solemn  charter must binding european constitutional right be
we do today not the first step to a european superstate
that we for fundamental the the union and constitutionalisation the the treaties stand means not that we to the united states the europe besides
there must however as quickly possible a constitutional text for europe to which the citizens clear and comprehensible statements on europe find the must are what rights the citizens have what powers the union has adopted and what powers also in the future by the member will be exercised and how europe are tasks with all guarantees for a protection the the human according the principles the the law will role
the the task must we robustly
the way must we to
mr the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner the first join i i the the the  congratulate my congratulate the all participants the the convention and with particularly the the mr méndez the vigo and my mr great berès
with your if would i also with any feeling the proud the active and committed participation the commissioner antonio vitorino want emphasise
i question your attention for three points the here already in the during the the morning by my colleagues are mentioned
in the first place deserves the commendable method the this convention follow
the however formula must in the future further be needs especially with the view the the revision the the treaties the the european union
the second must the charter necessarily a binding nature have
the european citizens would but difficult can understand that europe more work makes the the market and the currency than the the real implementation the their rights and fundamental
the third urge i that the as others here before i have done that in the conclusions the nice and with particularly in the revision the the treaty in article member a reference to the charter the the fundamental the included
the enough not the charter to sign and with many house the to announce the rights must also really in the practice be the
hence our call to the presidency the must the before the are colleagues in the council a educational function exercise
to finally i i still two proposals one am i the believe that the signature and ratification the the charter the the fundamental by the parliaments the the countries part must of the their acquis community
hand must the conclusions the nice a clear timetable to contain so the countries the in the future the presidency will modified the the charter the the treaty can move i i for that the relevant term interests with the ratification by the respective parliaments the the new revision the the treaties what in nice must be decided
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the charter that we today with the conviction the good europeans will approve is certainly a step forward in the construction the a political europe which we the believe
many have that out that this text not the legal status the a treaty has therefore must there more steps follow
the final objective is a european constitution a fundamental law for a union
the union must not limited continue to a common currency but must a political reality are with a really common foreign and security they must a equal partner for the united states be the the challenge the the globalisation tackles the will in the next years also the asian countries to start with china a role play
mr the president the charter is therefore only the beginning the difficult and them but same  task
the text the we today will approve is the fruit the a compromise and as president poettering has said he the us the some points not satisfied therefore must the charter the the forms for a broad debate on the future european constitution
the charter the the fundamental must the rights legal binding desperate and the powers the the union the member and the region programmes set also must the by the people be confirmed
that is the reason that the charter by this parliament and the national parliaments must be dealt and approved
the members the forza italia are there together with the european party the convinced that the europe the the future still more the rights the the person and the family must protect and must prevent that new forms the racism and antisemitism the it learn therefore will they for the recommendation the the charter the the fundamental vote
the da mr the president first and especially thank i the participants the the convention both the members the the commission if the the the parliament and the council
i think that they very certainly work have made
the charter that we today must approve strengthened and clarification the common fundamental and values which our community built must to are
the is a charter that the human in strong extent central the
i will few important points to the to
first and especially think i the good that respect asked the for the treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the court for the rights the the human in strasbourg
the is important that we the authority the both bodies not undermine
also think i the positive that for the the the the common values account must to be taken with the different cultures and traditions in europe
i think that the important is this for view to the to the necessary support the the european citizens for the charter to to
the charter contains still a very positive element namely farreaching provisions for the protection the minorities and the fight the discrimination
that think i very positive
i think the also good that the forwardlooking has thought and also new view in the text has included
i think example the the environment and the biotechnology
i think that the approval the the treaty the nice a strong signal will give to the countries and will show that the eu the respect the the fundamental rights serious assent
to finally am i satisfied that the charter in nice if a political document will be adopted
i think that the a good basis will forms for the dialogue on the future development the europe the we with the citizens must into
the the mr the president mr the president the the council ladies and gentlemen the is clear that if one the the groups in the parliament or one the our more than hundred political parties the charter had up the there the many points otherwise had looked
that is however not relevant
the was that the a european consensus to find the is now for
this is world the most document on the fundamental the deserves our appreciation
if i the good i has the convention from more than treaty achieved what if right in eligible was
the convention has also the fundamental values the the european union clarification i like the speakers the in the charter example the responsibility the the policy the god miss that point that in the preamble the that this text in the aware the the spiritual religious and moral heritage the the union is formulated
i i still a other comment
unfortunately enough was the not possible the right the minorities adequate in the charter the to take
the delegation the the european parliament wanted that with ethnic minorities account was taken in the convention was that however not feasible
the shortcoming must here to be the
i i also still a floor for our critics
the is usual that the policy by the journalists the criticised
that is also good and not not to change i like however agree the opposite do and against our critics the journalists say you you on the whole line fail
during nine months is in all openness the in the most transparent procedure ever the the this fundamental work the european journalists have however fail and the citizens not the the informed taken the what here was
mr the president i like not already to long consider the the consequences the this charter the different levels can have within the union know the european citizens now that europe the not only with economic aspects concerns
what the enlargement the can not only country now more think that the to the union can join if the are internal justice not way accordance the principles the the charter international given the europe with the charter finally a important signal the
the charter has however still other consequences with particularly for us internal justice
just if others am i the opinion that there in article referred must be to the charter also think i that this text the a later at included must to be in the treaties
who believe there moreover still in that the adoption the this charter by us parliament not legal consequences will have
the parliaments are traditionally the guardians the the public freedoms the method the here the applied is somewhat strange because in the parliamentary right a  not there
we will will officially and the very formal way this charter adopt to i hope with a majority majority in this parliament very what courts will their statements the this charter base even when the not immediately in the treaties the included
the adoption the this charter has moreover also consequences for our own method
i will you a example give
my colleagues the the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs have i appointed to rapporteur the the compliance the the rights the the human in the union must into course will the situation after the adoption the the charter not more same are if this
after this parliament the charter the the fundamental has adopted will this text the point forms for my research
i will all personal and intellectual resources use and optimum use make the the staff the i the available me to per country and for any right to into in what the charter in the fifteen member the the union the observed if parliament must we there because the ensure that the rules the we adopt be observed
our principle must the are that the human the not few way should be violated but let we the reality not from the view lose
the human be certainly not in all cases  we have here all the duty to into how we this violations the the human the the denounce can to
there must because a court are to the violations to condemn and a public administration to research from to to and to prevent that the violations the repeat this is in any case the  the your rapporteur will follow gentlemen members after the charter the the fundamental will is adopted
mr the president the problem with the european charter the the fundamental how noble the intentions also are the the be pursued is according i first the thoughtlessness that the document refers only to institutions but even the the areas the the jurisdiction which the eu currently not competence has with all possible undesirable consequences the this
to a example from the criminal to give europe would by the abolition the the right to extradition the  the countries the the death know a haven for american who can be
the set the the peut commission in for principle example would the british authorities in embarrassed to because this just decided has this principle the to abolish
the second problem is that the those ridiculous over are and easy can be abused
this rights open the door for homosexuals the want married and children want preparing and the clauses on discrimination the  would ensure can ensure that the in the united kingdom not longer must refuse  in service to take when this not english speak
the provisions and clauses would even a threat can forms for the thatcherite  the in the years s in the united kingdom took
the most worrying is the  scenario that article offers namely the suspension the fundamental if the interests the the european union the the stake are
we have already given what there happened is with the book the bernard  this critical book on the commission was by the court the first instance banned
will there a situation the which only political correct statements on the eu be tolerated
this charter is not only in instance harmful but also unnecessary because we already the available have on the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human that in was supported by the large conservative politician winston churchill and the articles and the the treaty the amsterdam
we are witness been the the hypocrisy in the parliament when the  not prepared was support to give the my point on  for the italian royal family
in britain be we already faced with the consequences the the court motto that the power the us national parliament does 
nonelected judges would this trend in european the still considerably further can stands
the only what the the is a competitive jurisdiction between the european court the justice and the court for the rights the the human also plays the there the  early that in the card or must i say in the europe
finally is the a ground for statements that the eu determined is a federal constitution from to to with the a charter if first chapter
mr the president the vote on the charter is a sign that we again the way to a european constitution in are beaten
the union is a  in the economy but if they without soul remains if the trade together with the democratic deficit growing growing also the risk that the competitiveness in conflict is with the solidarity and that a  market the  to the past encourages in social and geographical areas the the in their traditions and their safety threatened feel
the charter has many those but also many enemies we have the criticism heard the those the not political europe want
this differences make part from the the freedoms the in the charter itself be recognised
by the arguments the the enemies the the charter is not only the political importance the the charter more to the but also the legal gentlemen that the is not in fight with the treaties but strengthened the democratic perspectives
for some is the charter a to small for others a to large step
the members the the european party the christian roots have are that convinced that the appeal the the spiritual and moral heritage the europe the cohesion the a union which cultural and political diversity positive be as will strengthen
the method the has led in a transparent and open convention and the work the the mr méndez the vigo and the other mr programmes deserve our assent
now expect we the nice a strategy the the europe a union the economic social and political rights makes
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen members i will the speech the antonio vitorino not can exceed i will the therefore briefly the to the quality the the debate in this parliament to stress
a such quality good debate has also within the convention place i like than also the members the your parliament the the the work the the convention involved were praise my
the does i pleased that the in the during the this debate obviously a clear majority the favour the this text without also already must a number the you still be convinced some find that the text a to binding nature has and therefore to progressive is which the charter a number reforms destroying would can do
i can from this comments perhaps how that this text a reflects is the us europe that progress meeting by means the compromises between different views countries and traditions i think that the words and however moves they the galileo good the this situation the application are
i like here only like the a few remarkable points the in this debate to the are the
first mr dupuis think i certainly not that the here to a materialise text is
i am other just if antonio vitorino the opinion that he a joint vision the our union represents and that the charter in the words the the mr enrique barón our union the a real legitimacy provides personally am i that convinced that the here to a very important contribution is the the the expectations the our citizens meets
our citizens have because need the importance the values a the recognition the their rights
this text although incomplete and limited provides in this needs
this applies also for the needs the the citizens the the countries the expect to rights and values
i am that convinced that the charter as fully in the political community acquis will be included
course has you during this debate the discussion on the legal the this charter resumed
in my capacity the presidentinoffice president the the council can i you assure that your message clear the i is matter this applies in the particularly for the strong very the the mr enrique barón
i like here however again stress that if we from the beginning if demand had the that the charter a binding nature would must to you disappointed on the text would are been
the choice was because clear or a substantial text the although not directly a binding nature had or a text the perhaps immediately a binding nature would have but the in fact devoid would are been
also see the there to from that there the within the european council not majority without for a such binding nature
we build the a  political project and any stage counts here that
to the reason think i that we there sensible the do the basis the this charter to consolidate and us then the the next level for to prepare
i am that convinced that us  political project early or late the completed
the commissioner has just ospar how this charter was up from the view that the agree a binding nature would to
just if he am i that convinced that the both the the immediate term a unique the will have if soon binding will be
what the method the am i the opinion that the compromise the text not has weakened but precisely our agreement on the values and rights the we parts has stressed
there is said that the citizens not the the work are involved i think this criticism partly unjustified
never earlier in the history the the european europe is the stronger with so conviction and success applied there is listened to the european alliance the trade that million workers in europe represents
further are there hundreds ngos programmes consulted and have the citizens their contribution the the charter can make as has the convention a number proposals the citizens adopted
to finally the most aspect the the charter namely the content i i is the charter the not devoid since the the citizens what to offer has
we can even speak the a  and ambitious content the convention has ensure elected the fundamental the to to the the hand the the different documents the the council the europe the treaties and the constitutions the the member
the human the in the charter are expressed are the large importance
i think example the the immunity the the human dignity and the right the life that a ban the the death change
the charter is modern
the the account with ethical aspects the the new technologies and different and their consequences for the personal freedom
i think example the the right the human integrity and the right the protection the data with mrs great berès am i that convinced that the social rights not scrapped should continue
in the charter be the social values the the european europe confirmed and the the respect for this values within the member guaranteed
the this way will the confidence the the citizens in the union be strengthened
in the charter the also special attention spent the groups vulnerable citizens as disabled children and elderly
in the charter the also the strong way the equality the men and women the all areas stressed just if the principle the nondiscrimination
the union must i i proud are the the particularly strong way which already this rights are expressed
in the charter are finally the principles the the union included the fundamental freedoms the the community be in remind the and the european citizenship the still agree stressed
also the in the charter about on the right the properly administration what subject that the here to a ambitious text is
during this debate i i a number comparisons heard the there not to union as was the charter compared with a brusque that the the dog in this case the european parliament would 
also was the text as if considerations for the failure the a  french presidency with particularly what the the way which the leadership the the the igc i like moreover further not like the this strong sentences the i not always can support and which i hope that they rationally can be after the adoption the the treaty the nice
this allotted like i stress that the the summit the nice important decisions taken must be
we must consider the article but also the article i hope that we with the to this two articles important reforms can changes
the summit the nice is the large important but must not be as if the 
the summit is only a stage in the process the the european europe and i think that the charter a the the most elements the this stage will forms i look with pleased from to the options the your parliament will present
the debate is closed
the vote take to at place
turkey
the the the item is the joint debate on the next two reports
a the the mr morillon behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the periodic report the the commission on the progress the turkey the the way to accession com the c the cos
a the the mr seppänen behalf the committee on the proposal for a decision the the council on amendment the decision ec to the the a special action the the eib the support the the consolidation and deepening the the customs between the ec and turkey com the c the cns
mr the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the commissioner the december has the european council decided to turkey the status the candidate the the european union to to know and a accession in to to and one only financial framework for support the turkey if candidate the the meet the the criteria the copenhagen
in this light has the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence the before report up i like here already my mr programmes thank for the contribution the they have made the this report which concluded the that turkey currently not the the criteria the copenhagen meets as already earlier by the commission was confirmed
since the decision the helsinki has turkey considerable efforts made with particularly what the reform the the legal the to better meet to to the the requirements the the european union notably the regard the the respect the the human
this that under more from the report the the mr  secretary the the turkish coordination high council for the human which a has package for the reform the the constitution is included
we must however also see and understand that the awareness the the extent the the reforms for down has taken in the different political parties and the turkish public opinion
the turkish citizens aware that their accession to the union not only a painful reform the their institutions requires and a partially give the the sovereignty which they much adopted are but that also their habits and mentality drastically will must change
therefore has the parliament proposed a euroturkish forum to create where area is for a indepth dialogue between occasionally representatives the the turkish community and this appropriate european members
the accession the turkey is to important for the future the the union and the turkey itself to the decision to to take in the could the the cabinets without a indepth open discussion
both in the european parliament if in the national parliaments must this extended be discussed everyone recognises than also that the way to the accession long and difficult the
the up the the by the parliament proposed forum would the first obstacles from the way must overcome
us parliament must our turkish partners in the framework the this forum and during this debates clear make that they the european on not interference in their internal affairs must fear but that we their a still more the to through contract present in the framework the the accession and the the agreement on the charter the the fundamental
the is the them to this contract to accept or the to point
in the current situation is the also the task the us parliament to the turkish people clear to make that the the accession least three conditions are linked
in the first place the respect the the need the a own identity the our citizens in very europe still more show as they more the need feel to their identity to region against the new progress the the globalisation
europe is the that aware that the diversity are wealth is and is determined this need the a own identity to recognise therefore domains the the rights and also the duties the the minorities
in the same spirit like the turkey help to a solution to find for the kurdish problem
the second problem which clear as quickly possible a solution must be found is cyprus
no would understand that cyprus divided remains by a wall as there the last decade fortunately many other are cases example in berlin or sarajevo or more recently the wall between the both korea programmes
finally must the weight the the army in the political decisionmaking gradually be reduced since the fight against the terrorism if completed can be as
this are the three conditions the the important are
us parliament has the  genocide in recognised
some want if supplementary condition for accession that the turkish government this genocide also recognises
this wish would with the the letter and spirit the the peace that in copenhagen for all countries is the
just if all in bosniaherzegovina live communities i i too ago under the tragic consequences the the systematic references to the atrocities the used to to can believe that we a peaceful and stable future can build if we continue with the feed the the  from the past
mr the president mr the minister mr the commissioner we deal today two reports which the  especially political and my report especially technical the nature is
the council the for to turkey the the countries to add which loans the the european investment can be provided while the european union for the appropriations offer the
the council the unanimously for turkey to to add the the countries the guarantees to and the committee is the this unanimously that agree
unanimity the not in that we all satisfied would are with the democracy in turkey and the way which turkey the human respects that are we namely not
now turkey are application to membership the the european union has tabled is the certainly also good the the informed the the membership the copenhagen
now the european union in helsinki turkey has included in the group countries which on accession the negotiated can the situation the the human in turkey not longer a internal matter continue
with the  has turkey the european union the right given the with are internal affairs to interfere
the temptation to the the loans the turkey conditions to link with the to the democracy was large but what this report the were this not technical opportunities for
there is namely only there the a supplement the the previous decision ec the the council
if the conditions had want to had the that last year with the previous decision must do
when was the not that turkey by the positive development the the negotiations to the countries would to properly the guarantees to
also could there not conditions be the with only a decision the the european parliament
i draw the attention the the fact that the parliament little influence can exercise the the policy the the european investment and that the european union the activities the the bank on the general bad control
the guarantee the the european budget which the loans the turkey be guaranteed one to the compulsory expenditure and the council not therefore not account to the with the positions the the parliament
in the european parliament want we in the general conditions to the the by the european investment granted appropriations especially what the the environment and the social security the citizens from third countries and in the case the turkey what the the respect the the human
the current legal the the guarantee makes that however not possible
the cooperation between the european institutions must better be
the problems with the control the the administration the the european investment the also because in its administration only representatives the the member are and a part the them like prevent that the commission and the european parliament the with the affairs the the bank interfere
the european investment is therefore a the the last safe ports the the banking in the world
this has the not burden the the tide the the social discussion
finally draw i the attention the something where the commission the know therefore like i especially the attention the the council this draw in are the financial resources the the guarantee not sufficient for all obligations the are made
that is probably also in the case
if the the the obligations notion must the ceilings be review
that is the only point which the parliament passed is are opinion to give
the council the the the point more loans and guarantees to to know than what he passed is
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen rapporteurs gentlemen members you you indicated price to to the a debate on the links between the european union and turkey as you know importance the presidency the the council many gentlemen the the strengthening the this links
since there in helsinki decided is to turkey if candidate the to see has the relationship between this country and the union because a new genuinely been the debate on the report the the mr morillon and the report the the mr seppänen is exactly the the good at because the commission has us just two very important documents sent
if you i allow like i like start with the very interesting report the the mr morillon the has the the all aspects the the  relationship and in the particularly the the periodic report that few weeks before the the european council the helsinki by the commission is presented
in helsinki has the council respond given the the recommendations the in the report the the commission are included and has he turkey if candidate recognised to i believe can we all this the the affairs support
since have the union and turkey measures affected to the in helsinki taken decisions to to to in specific action
i think the course the the work the within the association are taken order the turkish legislation the to apply the the community acquis the mr morillon has this point just stressed
i think however especially also the the efforts the turkey the has made to the the to apply the the european standards and practices this applies in the particularly for the failure the the human and the consolidate the the law
we know that there still many work must be opposition but i believe that turkey now really the path the the reforms is path
the is our task if europeans to this country to hand the this very long and difficult way to accession
i doubt there moreover not the that any the us prepared is to turkey the where hand to offer the the process
who is to better in the than your european parliament
i am than also pleased on your proposal to a euroturkish forum for the human the to up so the turkish citizens fully can benefit the the opportunities the europe offers but the also aware aware are the the demands the europe the
course know i that there still always question be placed the the status the turkey has been if candidate
i  that there many doubt there not only within your parliament but also within all member
i i good note taken the the wish the excellent by the mr morillon is expressed to closely involved to be the this issue
late i very clear on this point are
i think that no the debate on this issue from the way like to contrary
there have many often difficult debates on this issue place in both the european parliament if the national parliaments the the member
i think however that this debates a give the had
the french presidency will certainly respond give the this legitimate wish to transparency information and debate
i i witness the  the your like to this process the preparation the the accession the turkey successful to let has and the the demonstrated the your whole legitimate wish for large vigilance on the still always very considerable reforms the this country still must changes
i like stress that we all find that the negotiations not the start should to as turkey still not fully has met the the political criteria the copenhagen
therefore i i good note taken the the suggestions the the mr morillon has done on the conditions the the the accession the turkey are linked
the parliament the presidency the the council and the commission are all aware the the fact that turkey the still the necessary efforts must make and reforms must changes with the to important aspects as the compliance the the human the fundamental freedoms and with particularly also the minorities the this points has turkey unfortunately still to little progress made
the commission has this point still in its last report on the progress the turkey stressed in are report stressed the mr morillon however she that we ensure must ensure that we to many new and also excessive conditions link the the applicant the turkey
turkey must the footing the equality with the other countries dealt be
this fundamental principle is in helsinki confirmed and must the  relationship help strengthen
general said think i that we turkey not the feeling must give that we back the our agreements and the the principles the ourselves in helsinki have the
to the reason must the union the also the the other promises the the they this country has done with particularly what the the financial assistance the french presidency has this point to objective become and i believe that we in this issue progress make
course have we your parliament several times asked the on issue from to speak
i think the the the meda and the regulations the the commission the financial area has proposed to europe and turkey closer the other to to and the customs to hand i think the however also the the aid the the eib the the large important are to the economic development the turkey to can hand and the business after the earthquake new life in to can revive
what this point the am i pleased on the conclusions the the report the the mr seppänen on the special action the the eib the support the the consolidation and deepening the the customs between the ec and turkey
france has during are previous presidency in everything in the work the to this agreement the relative the a customs to the to to
this customs is the january in force into we must however recognise that there less appropriations the turkey are granted than the union time had committed
especially the last year is there progress to there and i think the than also a good matter that the commission a increase the the appropriations for turkey has announced
the is the important that the financial resources the for turkey be budget part with the time legislation objectives
the presidency wishes that this special action on eib as soon possible by the council the adopted that like say already during the meeting the the ministers the economic affairs and finance the november next
i like this add that we all with interest look to the by the commission announced proposal for one few regulation the basis which all community support for turkey can be coordinated accordance the conclusions the the council the helsinki
course must the way the aid the preparation the the accession the turkey just if the the other countries be harmonised according the model the the phare
course will your parliament the to due time can express on this issue
as you know is this preaccession the turkey with particularly for to this country to help the objectives to achieve the for the future accession are down
the is here to a very important instrument in the framework the the preaccession for this country in its last periodic report stressed the commission rightly the important the this instrument
the competent bodies the the council will this proposal detailed study you understand that i if president the the council not the the affairs forward can are
without favour to do the the debate that this week the start is think i to should to that the commission a very constructive proposal has done which high demands be the the both the union if turkey
the does i than also pleased that this proposal with the the very welcome recommendations the the mr morillon
i think the the the intensification the the efforts the in the process must be done this applies in the particularly for the separation the powers and the lifting the the state the in some provinces the turkey the force is
the is the wish the the presidency that this proposal quickly the approved if possible already the november during the next council general affairs as i already i indicated must the the very closely defined decisions the helsinki to be observed
turkey must then the the hand the this proposal a national programme the to to the basis which the community acquis can be adopted and all necessary reforms with support the the union can be implemented
we are there us all aware the aware that there for everyone many work is to oppose in this long and complex process we must demanding and vigilant are but our promise the turkey fulfilling continue do and that confidence that this country further to the union like to
we must turkey therefore in the to to the necessary reforms by to to hand have we the fully right the turkey to expect that the this reforms also actually obvious
mr the president mr the president the the council ladies and gentlemen first like i the gentlemen morillon and seppänen you thank for their very constructive and political very sensitively reports this debate take the a particularly positive at place
as you know has the commission in the over week not only the report on the progress but for the first in the history the our relations also the proposal for a accession presented
the am i to can say that the turkish government this accession meantime if basis for the further cooperation has recognised we should therefore hope that we with us policy the reformists in turkey will can support and the reform with the view the membership the the european union a new impetus will can give
in the present resolution is the emphasis the our common objective turkey closer the the european union to to
the must clear are that the fixed and sustainable conditions the turkey in our values in us european strategic important is
we want that turkey a modern and open country the where democracy human and law in eight be taken and minorities be protected and respect
we can now already say that the  a number interesting and important developments the the has the
in turkey itself are the first signs see the a reform a process the fundamental and farreaching political reforms
the turkish relations are clear improve
few days ago still have the greek and turkish ministers the foreign affairs confirmed that both countries both bilateral if in nato confidencebuilding measures want amount and out
finally were in the framework the the united nations also the discussions on cyprus resumed
to now to have already five  place
that is the the already a important success
as the commission in its report on the progress very clear has said must turkey in the framework the the accession just if all other countries the the criteria the copenhagen meet
our attention is currently in the first place to the political criteria as this not fully is met can the negotiations because not there are
on the opening the negotiations can therefore only be about if we the that the political conditions fulfilled are that is today not the case
in the parliament have many often harks given the their concerns
we must us indeed ensure make on the inadequate respect the the people and minorities on the constitutional has role the the army the situation the the population the kurdish origin and the emergency in the four provinces in the southeast
as i already said has the  however also already to positive developments and results led
the most result think i that after helsinki in turkey a public debate on the conditions for the accession the turkey to the european union the the is has that debate supports and promotes the reform forces in the country
a example of is the report the the commission human in the turkish parliament on  in turkey but also the decision the the turkish government on the adaptation the the turkish constitution and the turkish system the the values the the european union
importantly is that everything what is announced and in turkey is discussed now also really in practice the the
the by us proposed accession is the best way to that easier to make and there also for to ensure that the european union the necessary influence the the process can exercise
we have said what priorities turkey the short and medium term in the framework the a national programme must out to the the criteria the copenhagen to meet the financial cooperation will this be between
in the political part the us document be the fundamental and farreaching political reforms described
the reforms include constitutional guarantees for freedom the expression right the sitting and freedom abolition the the death end the all  adaptation the the role the the army the the rules the a democratic community lifting the the emergency in the southeast the the country and allocation the cultural rights the all turks the what ethnic origin also
in my contacts with the turkish government i i always stressed that the european union expect that turkey the to regard specific steps to take to the intended reforms from to to
i am that convinced that the turkish government the necessary reforms determined like tackle
president  has past month in a speech for the turkish parliament clear said why there for turkey itself not alternative for the reforms is
i join i fully the the what the turkish president said has turkey must a real democracy be not only because the european union that like but also because the turkish people that deserves
that everything like say that we still very many work for the go have
that applies moreover also for the within the the economic criteria and the ability to the community acquis on to take
i see also here large agreement with the report the the mr morillon
you know that the commission in july a regulation has proposed the the legal for the accession is and this also a financial framework creates
this text is for opinion the you for
i like the this debate use to you to ask this proposal to support
without this legal can the accession not be approved and can the are doubt positive influence not let apply
we demands the turkey if candidate the the european union thorough reforms
versa must we therefore also prepared are turkey in that reform to support as we that also for all other countries with many greater financial resources do
if possible contribution this has the commission proposed turkey a credit the the european investment the eur the million euro to to are the must in the particularly the competitiveness the the turkish economy in the european internal market be improve
in the relations between the union and turkey the the implementation the the necessary political reforms a important perhaps even the most point
the am i that you next week to the the the joint parliamentary commission with your turkish mr programmes on the issue the mind will exchange
i welcome also the proposals in the present report with the to the intensification the the parliamentary cooperation and the greater role the the civil
i thank you for your attention
the es mr the president in the framework the the debate on the accession the turkey to the union is the report the rapporteur seppänen particularly useful
the is to the the the a special programme the support the the consolidation the the customs proposed the the mandate the the european investment from to extend so the cover the new loans the turkey the eur the million euro during the period something can the
the committee has with general vote its approval the the resolution adopted this special programme provides in a package for a amount the million euro
the a  the will a amount the million euro from the reserve to the guarantee must from there will therefore only there are the a  if not the commitments can be met and there a appeal the the guarantee will be done
with this loans the the european investment support we the investment the for the the turkish industry and the infrastructure in that country the the area the transport energy and telecommunications
a and another must contribute the increasing the the competitiveness the turkey within the customs and the the reduction the the negative influence the the dismantling the customs the the turkish economy has
the is therefore not much within the committee that there problems with turkey are late that especially clear are
the most problem the the accession the turkey is still still a political matter the to the competence the other parliamentary committees one
the customs and the loans the the european investment are affairs the already long the this way with turkey be regulated
we want now something do with the view the a possible accession the the country to the european union
serious problems do the only for if with the promised macrofinancial assistance the target the achieved in that case would the  for guarantees in and practical to zero are reduced
let we not from the view lose that the european union there important the has to in the framework the euratom projects the nuclear safety in third countries to finance
a naturally the the  can certain problems with the would for the financing the this investment
in the report out with particularly the negotiating between parliament and council the regard the the budget for the year in the view the european parliament like better informed and more consulted be if the union external obligations with financial consequences affects
that is the position the the group the the european party also the parliament has here in first reading for voted
we hope that a and another to a tripartite dialogue and conciliation lead
the the mr the president ladies and gentlemen mr the president the the council mr the commissioner behalf my group congratulate i the both rapporteurs with their reports
the is not simple a report on turkey the to to there are because very contradictory developments
positive developments are the appointment the the new minister the european affairs and the institution the a secretariat for european affairs the the prime the some areas is there however little progress in the preparation the turkey the the european union
nothing was taken to the death the to abolish almost nothing was taken to the rights the minorities and the human more in the legislation to law
regrettable is also that if president the a commission for the human in the parliament someone was elected the not clearly guarantees that the the human more important will be adopted
with the to the kurdish issue is the situation similar
also this was there a careful positive signal
there was said that the possible was the television and radio reports in the kurdish from to send and that the kurdish culture in certain extent could be recognised
hand were however a number mayors arrested and were there in the southeast in kurdish area problems for the prison
from this contradictions that that there in turkey itself a fight between progressive and conservative forces the the the is this last want not rapprochement to europe
i regret that the very
the mr verheugen has however right
we must and will everything do to the positive and progressive forces in turkey to support
in this the like i the also in all openness on the socalled  issue have
my group has in a sitting which i unfortunately enough not i can participate with a majority decided amendment to support
content is there also little against that amendment in to to already abuse many amendments on armenia and the bloodbath under the armenia to here indirectly fundamental any against the turkish membership the the european union to have what i regret and wrong and dangerous think
i know not what the result the the vote will are but request turkey urgent this issue serious the to summarise
we must open and honest are on our own history and what our  and states have done
turkey and armenia must together a new attempt take to by  to let into what there is happened to clarity to create and a clear position in to take
that is the best way to this difficult situation the to solve the is always difficult that the outside the to to
the is better that the involved countries itself clarity to
in that the like i the again have on what the commissioner has said he has said that the in us strategic important is turkey the sustainable way in the european values to law
therefore is the and turkey must that know
also already is this parliament critical perhaps more than the council and commission can are however hope we that turkey this way direction and that the as soon possible member the the european union can be
mr the president the european liberal group is the the i agree with the  we find the a doing honest and strong document
we will us oppose against the attempts which a number a quite  impression makes to the balance that in the report with so success to the is the objectives to make and than objective i with particularly the the amendments the the european parliament in the  try to places and on the past try to let judge
turkey is clear the place where a debate on the past must place and the in the framework the the general hearts with the to the fundamental
a such selfassessment is a from cultural revolution
we must there welcome that are that this process obviously a beginning has taken
the  and the accession force the european union to the candidacy the turkey
the is now the turkey to to let see that the member like be
the european parliament will are contribution make the the in the the the relations with political parties the ngos and the press but will also are difficult sometimes could relationship with the turkish parliament further build
the european liberals are certainly prepared that to work the the closer to the the turkish membership and the spread the prosperity stability and safety under all european peoples
the fr mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i like mr morillon congratulate with are report
unfortunately you you or better said are we there not in managed to all problems the to solve
the strategy to turkey if candidate the to see was now the right because as the commissioner just has said the debate that currently in turkey place on accession to europe not from can be given the the debate on the radical political reforms the in that country must be implemented
i objective here the the reforms the in the constitution and the other legislation must be implemented as must turkey example amnesty to to the are citizens the because a crime the expression in the prison 
turkey will now therefore to the practice must move
let we clear are as turkey the act not the the floor add will there not new stage in the accession can place
as the the exactly in the  expressed
what the situation the cyprus the must we turkey to let know that we a refusal the this country the decision the the european court in strasbourg to accept unacceptable consider
turkey is already several times condemned
the country must without respond to give the the decisions the the court and the the to give that the the by us and not only by turkey the international relations accepts
we are now now the a very important point
in this parliament and within the member there different strategies one are there the those the the turkish candidacy and the accession the this country to the union
this those want that turkey are society completely change to for accession in eligible to can to
hand are there the opponents the the accession they up the in the debate the the turkish policy and the the necessary reforms to the to show that turkey far the the union from is
the may clear are that in turkey same unlike means is
to the reason is the last obstacle the these must be as important namely the issue the the genocide in armenia
no in this parliament and myself already at not will deny that the armenia against the end the the  rich the victims are become the a genocide
further is the clear that turkey just if any other civilised society are past must accept how even the also been is
in terms the ideology and civilisation is this a absolute condition for accession to the union
there is still a another issue if there today voted the will the majority part the my group the resolution support
personally am i not convinced the the usefulness the the vote i see would that we there us for working that this debate in turkey place
i like therefore proposals that the european parliament a debate on the genocide in armenia the the brings and then this debate which the a majority will everywhere in turkey believe
the the mr the president i thank the gentlemen morillon and seppänen for their reports
mr morillon your report witness the expressed realism and responsibility
in the months since the decision the the council the helsinki has the turkish government indeed a number interesting symbolic action the
there is however nothing changed the the dismally situation in the turkish prisons the discrimination the the kurds and the turkish policy with the to cyprus
the endorse role the the turkish army the incompatible is with the law and the democracy is doubt the large discussion for the further relations between the european union and turkey the only solution is the power the the army to to
in my group are the opinions on the report the the mr morillon divided we will our criticism with the to the mentioned issues however certainly not temper
for other groups applies believe i same a compromise is almost always possible but in this case not
the most and most specific result is to now to the fact that in turkey a beginning is made with a debate and a certain political distinction
we must that recognise and active support
the is not only to the within the the criteria the copenhagen but also to the compliance the the necessary democratic standards
the the basis and not only from geostrategic considerations the the usa or the nato can the membership the turkey a enrichment for the european union and a important step to a single europe are
the european union would the in that case geographical to far outside europe functions to region programmes the from the view the safety extremely  can be mentioned i see that problem not on the head
i think the unacceptable that the strategic aspect the the european integration in the with the status the candidate the turkey and the current enlargement to the east by the governments and the commission never with the parliament be discussed the is my experience that there not alternative is for critical openness
i am just familiar with radical social changes if with the refusal time to recognise that the radical social changes essential are
something otherwise than openness would only in the card play the them the both in the european union if in turkey not want that turkey to the union sign
mr verheugen here understand i the by you presented report on the progress not more
during your visit the turkey in march and also today you you the problem the the kurdish population just if today least or the
in your report think i on nothing back
in compared with the report the the previous commission is that a unfortunate step
truth means agreement the the understanding with are reality
that was least georg  hegel
i see to now to not real progress in turkey already matters i the the for possible
the report the the commission is for i however a step backwards
colleagues you you please to are and your discussions strike
we are still always with the debate are
interruption the the mr ferber says you that however in the german
mr ferber that has not sense because there people are the their headphones not  and just if you the german not powerful are but bavarian speak
mr the president gentlemen colleagues in the explanatory the are report declared general morillon that the accession the turkey to important is for the future the the union and the turkey itself so the decision to can be taken in the could the the cabinets without a indepth open discussion
we are the this support agree but to the that the decision the the european council the helsinki to turkey the status the candidate to to know not was preceded by the necessary public and parliamentary debate which in the mentioned explanatory there is
what the applicant the turkey the were the opinions in europe always quite divided the surprised us than also that there still still not indepth debate is opened on the motives the the union to have movers its traditional reluctance the regard the this candidacy to let see
to to start with we the the a geographical problem
are we perhaps forget that only a particularly small part the the turkish territory to the european continent one
in what new doctrine on the european area with this new concept the external that from the integration the turkey in the european union resulting
currently there there peace the the external the europe if turkey the a day to the european union sign will europe however not only the flouted countries borders the will also be exposed the war and conflicts
think but the iraq iran syria armenia or georgia
also conform the many restrictions which the exercise the the fundamental in turkey subject is absolutely not with the by the europeans  and accepted common democratic model the existence the the death is of the  but long not the only example
let we also the kurdish issue not from the view lose the turkish the refuses the fundamental on cultural identity the millions in turkey living kurds to recognise
to briefly to to we miss a critical analysis the the demographic dimension the the applicant the turkey and the the problems the this by will to not only the geographical area but also and especially the the level the the the the already particularly complex balance between large mediumsized and small member i conclude as i started am i i you there with my speech the want attention that such indepth about necessarily must place in the framework the a democratic and good founded debate
as not than are we the risk the distance between the citizens and the union still to increase we know because all that many europeans the impression have that they the the european construction be excluded
the fr mr the president from the  to the large contradictions in the european attitude the relation the turkey clear to the
in this resolution be all can issues the the item the first the the text are illusions and  formulas the fortunately immediately by the reality be overtaken
the turkish reality is because not line with the european illusions and dream the witness the large naivety and complacency to to to that the europeans the turks can they to i quote a drastic change the habits and mentality
the european union the the the very arrogance the with its wish to the turkish people its own values institutional principles and political culture the to to
has the e century than still not enough clear made to what horrors the the any reality  ideologies if the  and the  can lead
the turkish people must the right have to are own future the to can to the people must the our peoples can differences and are cultural values the obviously completely the our values differences can retain
we must us let lead by the reality turkey is not european country are culture and values are not european
consequently must this country not in the union to be included
this like moreover not say that europe must culture the the develop the the economic diplomatic political and peaceful links the the with a free and independent turkey its
benefit the this clear position is under more that the turkish governments already our wish and demands not longer blindly need to accept and that we the turks not longer commitments do which we the a later at new conditions link
the european contradictions and the european prevarication lead because only but to lack and humiliation
we must not longer play with the dignity the the peoples
we will therefore against this report vote just as we against all reports have voted which for inclusion the turkey in the european union the favour
the the mr the president ladies and gentlemen this report concern i large ensure
the problems are as large that accession the turkey within future time whole is excluded
i speaking this three arguments the in the first place is the problem the the minorities in turkey completely not resolved
in the second place is the end the the  conflict with greece on the island cyprus not in sight
in the third place based the turkish  still still the the a western democracy act death and the  the the police
recently still were the the german television terrible pictures shown the detainees the by the police been were beaten
turkey has therefore still a long and difficult way for the which the our aid doubt need has
our objective is turkey to help a free and democratic country to be where the principles the the law in eight be taken
the council must the the question to or he not more evil than good has done by turkey the status the candidate to to
the the evil there the that in turkey hope the accession the raised while the political situation that impossible makes
the islamic forces will the disappointment doubt in political success know to to to
vote
mrs the president i feel the if my duty that to point that we the the treatment the the paciotti and other directives and regulations the us be presented asked be a powerful phenomenon to regulate the information
the data the data is namely not  there are different types bases decided bases bases the the legal police bases the the secret service a enormous power therefore
the monitoring on the european bases entrust the a  body seems i put the the human if person with all respect for and confidence in the supervisory body invoked must the the power the the information can back the a reference the guaranteed rights and freedoms
according i would a body in  better the the demand have answered
in each case must we us the next times that we on the power the the information debate achieve that there a  control need is a control the therefore more guarantees offers for individual people
the fr the paciotti is a first the to the state the the behind the the area the the protection the the personal privacy and data
in this respect is the up the a independent supervisory a good matter
but the issues the really the important are when the is to the protection the the rights and the freedoms the people be no explicitly the the item the and the text the in technical respect often unclear is can the give to different interpretations
also is the text many less far than the french legislation on  and freedoms
in the report lack few proposals declaration the the there the a database would in all cases compulsory the must be
side between quantities with particularly when the is to data on the personal privacy health social circumstances etc would banned must to be to to prevent that there huge databases to workers the  deal with data would the possible made must be the pressure the their employers to resist by a code in to to as a clause with the to conscientious as journalists the know
finally would all forms the  the the transfer the data allowed must be to the citizens in the to to itself their personal privacy to protect
the must independent institutions ensure for the 
this are few fundamental points the in eligible taken must be to protection the data actually possible to make
since this points lack have we us the vote abstained
i am the the i agree with this report and i will  vote
the european citizens make the concern on the protection the their privacy and the concerns is not unjustified
any day be enormous quantities data this sorted and processed
that applies for payments with a  the check the the  the store the who with who fehmarn the surf the the internet the processing the other data the example from are the earlier completed forms and such
the eu the the threat the possible abuse the data preventing with two directives namely directive ec on the protection the natural people in the with the processing the data and on the free movement the the data and directive ec on the processing the data and the protection the the privacy in the telecommunications
not the both has the the the institutions
and however must there a system the rules for the protection the data to because the institutions not only internal data processing as data on their autonomous activities the budget and assessments the workers but also data the citizens the be this the the exercise the  example the provide the subsidies the into the cases the competition public tender statistical research data with the to the up and implement the legislation
with this report the this omission for a part loophole
 a
mrs the president how would the party the the pensioners not for the charter the the fundamental can vote
this is the first document the world the a such important which a article does no with the title rights the elderly that reads the union recognises and respects the right the elderly to a dignified and independent life to lead and to the the social and cultural life part to take
last recognises a important international organisation the most the there is namely the european union and the most institution of the only the directly by the people elected the the european parliament that elderly if such rights have
therefore voice i like for the charter
the fr arlette laguiller armonia bordes and armonia cauquil have against the charter the the fundamental voted we believe that a charter the workers in a class which the power  are not fundamental protection offers
basic rights if the right the a decent pension a minimum acceptable housing and adequate health to in this charter not for
the text contains the a article that child prohibits as children still attendance are but that article know a number exceptions a negative matter if you involved that many to many children in different european countries work out exploited be and deprived continue the sound education
this text offers in not only respect additional protection but the the authorities and the propertyowning classes the additional resources in hands to in this type issues in the attack to to
even the strike the not fully recognised the the limited by the seek accordance the national legislation and practices
the charter the therefore not few obligation in for the countries which the social legislation behind the the few that in the text is down
other would the the agree a counterproductive force can have in countries which the position the workers the law better regulated is
the charter would a impetus must give the the human and the social rights but the working only actions in the hand the that at are the rights in to limit
mrs the president i i not part the the vote on the charter the the fundamental because i the not agree am with the procedure the parliament has any amendments not can deal not only the the text the the charter but also not the the text the the recommendation
we had not choice accept or rejects
with this procedure am i the not agree and therefore i i there the prefer the given not the the vote that to do
the charter the the fundamental remains far behind the the statement the the rights the the human the the un the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the the constitution the many member the the european union
the assertion that for the first a reference does to social rights true not this such references also already are included in international agreements as the international agreements
the way the indication mention we the next articles
article says that all right has the work the the however not all programmes right the paid work recognises
article recognises the and this is the first time that a international text this reference the makes the the freedom the entrepreneurship
article offers the employers the possibility to  out and exclusion the  the negotiations with employers
article the the door opening open for each type genetic experiments
article recognises although the right the education but interprets this simple if a possibility to the cost follow the lessons and than only still in the framework the the compulsory education
this is a restriction and not enlargement the rights and the to for the hand present reasons
those the the the like idea are has a charter the to to want only a  document have to their attack the the acquired rights the the  continue to can to which the workers year long have fought sacrifices have the and blood have spill if the charter during the the both having summit the nice the adopted and the does there little to or this in the treaties the included or the form the the a simple statement will this a but good development are
the is doubt the intention that this charter end the preamble the the a future european constitution the the are turn the krone will to the the federal development the the european union than will a small number mandate also institutional the competence have to the take the already the decisions and this decisions will than by everyone must be applied
the interests the the oligopoly capital the the european union must be strongly that is the objective
we know very good that the charter the certain points for a number countries progress means
for the most countries is this however a step backwards in compared with what already the international level there
we must however progress and not backwards
the european members the the communist party the greece have against this text voted this is not only no but even dangerous
the fr the adopt the the charter for the fundamental would justified are if there already a european the would there with a through the general right adopted constitution that is currently not the case
the rights the are included in this charter are already anchored in the various national constitutions and the the compliance that the already ensure by the various national parliaments the close the the peoples and their culture are
the charter is also a compromise that based is the the smallest lowest lowest and is if such a threat for the social acquis the many the member
as is the right the housing reduced to a right the assistance the for the housing while the right the work replace is by a right the access to 
the the freedom the expression the not few reduction the what means that criminal statements encourage to violence or to xenophobic in the future not more to a condemnation will lead
finally lack in the charter provisions the regard the duties the however the counterpart are the rights
there is in our view than also not few reason to today a text if this the to take or the must are that the the attention like how the the failure whole according plan the the intergovernmental conference and the european council the nice
sos  rejected the charter the the fundamental the three grounds
the first because the unnecessary is
the second because the undemocratic is
and the third because the the freedom the the peoples the europe earlier will to than promote
we give a short explanatory the above three any in the order which they were mentioned
the ratification the the charter the the fundamental and freedoms would a the the most ambitious action are the the european union ever has done
before we to a act the such extent move must we ourselves however the to questions where in western the human the such  way be violated that a document if the before need is
we have per finally the account to make with fifteen modern democracies not with fifteen 
any member has already obligations the basis the the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human the universal statement the the un and a large number less important agreements
why must the eu the than means still the this area really
no has still answer given the this question
roman herzog president the the convention the with the draft was responsible has in all reparations they that with the charter not new rights be created
if that as is seems the us strange that there such large constitutional revolution the creating if the as little will
the human are perhaps not immediately risk in the eu but the democratic system that based is the the make the aware the the certainly risk
by the charter affects the european court the justice involved the political decisions the different areas as law  immigration and family
the fact that the judges not elected are does favour the the principle the democratic administration
worse still the basis the the charter will the european court the justice the a number new policies compulsory are to national laws or even provisions from the national ruled relation to explain
since the court the basis the the many more text the the existing european treaties already a worrying trend to court motto some expect we here with particularly serious problems
even those the the there the that agree are that there a  in written form is would however their reservations must have the a number provisions from the charter
our the concern applies article that rules that the rights which elsewhere in the document the referred aside been can be where they clash with the by the union recognised general important
that brings the concept the the   back that the council the europe the last fifty year as industrious has tried from to racial
the right the a authorities to are own constitution completely arbitrary aside to it is the accompany the a tyranny
in  avoided the this provision example also this was the part the the socalled 
less dramatically but the not less important is the fact that the charter bad in other is
take example article this article the any discrimination with particularly the on the gender race colour ethnic or social origin genetic characteristics language religion or convictions political or other ideas the properly to a national minority ability birth a disability age or sexual orientation is banned
when the the literally the change the article that a socialist party conservatives the the candidate want to for their party not must against or that a  men the opportunity must offer  to role
how such vague down provisions will be used in a  court late the easy councils
the human be already respect in the eu and protected by national constitutional provisions in agreement with the different habits the the member
the charter offers a way to this rights to to or saying to it without even but the impression to give that there new the are
we europeans let us there in big numbers the stand that we free are to everything to do what not specific the the law banned is
and now must we than our rights to from hands the european judges
sos  rejected the idea that we for the obtain the our freedoms on are the the eu
or to with   to speak freedoms me you not the take you
the sv in chapter vii general provisions article member in the draft the the fundamental the the european union the this charter creates not new powers or tasks for the community and for the union and change the in the treaties legislation powers and tasks not
therefore has the not real importance for the rights the the people
the debate on this charter is enthusiastic received by  the the like see if the beginning the a constitution for the european union
us i than there however a large risk the this charter
the danger the work the the council the europe for the rights the the human destroying to do and to to lead that the human in the future in the european countries the different ways be dealt
we vote against this charter because we the all not welcome
this means not that we against human the the are
we are however the opinion that this rights guarantee can be by other bodies than the european union
we are the opinion that the draft a bad product is that saying been must be
in place of to we the eu the to the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human to ratify as other treaties on social and cultural rights
the charter the the fundamental the the european union that us european parliament today has adopted is a extremely important document
certainly this charter some still a number shortcomings both terms content if terms form
certainly personally had i wanted that the social dimension many better from the s would are has
certainly i had like given that the charter directly would be included in our european treaties
but that everything must us pleasure not blight the is not to deny that there good work is done and that we today a important result made have
the charter the the fundamental is a document that applies for all citizens the europe
now is the matter this text the large scale to spread everyone that in knowledge to to and so possible citizens to questions what they that find
and than will the charter through the justice gradually can our to all national and european law
we should speak the a very good result both for the french presidency the the european union if for us european parliament
course in the future will we the text must adapt and make
we will the charter the very short term in our treaties must into
in following this will we a european constitution the the on must relationship with the view the a democratic transparent and effective europe that close the the citizens the
but i i there today again the that there all reason is to proud to are the the fact that we this for europe as important leap forward made have
i i before the charter voted and i am the agree agree that we not opposed must are against the rights the the be mentioned
as i already earlier in the parliament i said opposition i i however against the binding nature the the charter
the government the my country see the charter just if i if a political statement
we must ensure ensure that there not favour the done the and not confusion the on the existing rights the resulting from the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and supported be by the decision the the european court for the rights the the human in strasbourg
all member have the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human signed and ratified in the framework which a considerably system the laws and rights is built also has the treaty proven that the the with the society that development
i support the charter which today the voted but i see the not if binding text
the sv in chapter vii general provisions article member in the draft the the fundamental the the european union the this charter creates not new powers or tasks for the community and for the union and change the in the treaties legislation powers and tasks not
therefore has the not real importance for the rights the the people
the debate on this charter is enthusiastic received by  the the like see if the beginning the a constitution for the european union
i i than there however a large risk the this charter
the danger the work the the council the europe for the rights the the human destroying to do and to to lead that the human in the future in the european countries the different ways be dealt
i voice against this charter because i the all not welcome
this means not that i against human the the am
i am however the opinion that this rights guarantee can be by other bodies than the european union
i am the opinion that the draft a bad product is that saying been must be
i consider the charter the the fundamental if a acceptable step forward
however i i i during the last voting the vote abstained because i think that some social rights less good from the s to than the economic rights
as the only indirectly referred to the right the work and the right to to strike
the citizens the europe have the right to work the opposite would also the very strange are and they have the right the to to for their social interests by collective actions to take with including the strike
why the the strike not simply directly recognised
i would also the prefer have given the a charter that not only the has the the rights the the citizens but also the their duties towards the society
article rules very careful that the use the goods the law can be regulated as the general important that requires
but there the with not floor reference on the social obligations the associated with the right the property
in the charter be the fundamental freedoms mentioned which my citizens claim must can make but no the about on the duty the any citizens to the rights the others to respect
a society the rights know but not duties the themselves a selfseeking society
the members the the austrian freedom in the european parliament deny the important the the fundamental for the citizens the the union not
however have we us the the vote abstained one because make the content problems the the charter as the ban the the reproductive but not the the therapeutic cloning the people the us impossible the charter good to approve hand have we the the doubts the the convention if instrument for future constitutional developments
especially however can the clear overlap the the powers the the european court the justice and the the european court the the rights the the human to picked justice lead that can a unequal treatment the the citizens in this sensitive issue to result have what in contradiction with the fundamental would are
also is the not sufficient national members the the matter to involve to the national parliaments not the the constitutional development to must involve
in britain has the especially criticism the the eu because the fact that they the powers the its were allocated seems to exceed both what the farreaching omitting if what the application the
within the conservative party into we ways to the competence the to scenes ways the in agreement are with the letter and spirit the the treaties and account the with the position the the member in the heart the the european political process adopt
when in a number member the together one  legal area forms the inalienable characteristics the the system which the rights the the individual be protected and the borders the the political process be set be mentioned and anchored offers this enhance opportunities to this as consider objectives to avenue and to achieve
the problematic the the charter the the fundamental is that the a  is not system the rights with solid legal roots but also not political code which legal economic and social rights in certain sense together be and that lead to confusion and lack the clarity
i voice against the adopt the the charter the the fundamental especially because i distance wish to take the a symbolic and strong the the media specific action the intended is to the large public a message the hope and recognition that to give while the message largely the decision appear based is
the the consensus specific method the the members the the convention has as usual is in situations which unanimity requires is a extremely little result has a  charter and a text the large shortcomings some and full the the generalisations
the point the the convention was through the the the compromises to a text to to the by the fifteen member binding made would can be by into that in the treaties
end that the simply deception to are the text lacks any  and is not binding
the citizens the europe have at not need the a formal statement on the fundamental the the be their already guaranteed by a number international treaties and by the law the their own country
i i will with what now achieved is no more important to to in the integration the the european union
let we there a progress under to
with the charter have we a bad turn made to many symbolism and to many unanimity are disease in the political
want we that the citizens the involved feel the the policy and the institutions the the european union than applies certainly for us members that we more insight must give in the crucial choices the different often contradictory interests and the strong different intentions the the economic and social protagonists the the european eventually
the daily events the transport meal the the the that the market and the can the many more rules and controls subject must to be and late see that a stop must be through the the current the profits specific upon
we have better european legislation need the increase the the quality the the life the everyone and the increasing the the solidarity in the society
this must our fight in the first place at to are because the the way can we ensure ensure that the fundamental not only with the mouths lip be but also in political action into be
the way had us a europe in the prospect the that more would are than a economic market a currency and a 
thanks a charter the the fundamental would the social europe last really social be
but nothing is less where
this charter means a step back the social area from the view the freedom and democracy and is many less far than the now the force having treaties
there is very many pressure need been to the  and the strike end in the text included to to
on women be only few general comments made also the only said that they the right have to  and a family to means and immigrants the can the undertakings know against collective deportation
social rights lack whole and already not right the work but the right to to work
not right the social protection or the housing but the right the social assistance and the assistance the for the housing not right the pension or the a minimum
not ban the resignation but protection against obviously unreasonable resignation in fact the the fight against social exclusion be to a form the assistance while this basic rights the obligations content for the employers and the authorities without more would must be credit
course offers the charter the all area the the right the property and the the freedom the entrepreneurship
reasons to on to this charter not the to take in the treaties the the union we can the text as the now before than also not accept
the procedure the elected is for the up and adopt the the charter the the fundamental offers the european parliament actually only two opportunities the charter as the now before to accept or the to point
if i must choose between the two extremes is my decision completely clear i i behind this charter that i i a step forward means already is the than a very limited step given the content and the scope the the text
late i first like the the followed procedure
the method the the convention at the the find the broad consensus is a interesting and productive instrument when the is is a text the to to but the not few way is to justify that the european parliament that the voice the the european peoples hopes the possibility taken the the text to change or the to complement
when the historic research would do to the way which the universal statement the the rights the the human or other similar international statements to the are has would the to the discovery to that the parliamentary debate and the right the amendment very many have contributed the the thrust the importance and the objectives the this fundamental texts the today the day still nothing the  groping have
time with the issue the the already than not adopt the the charter is also the institutional debate way and everyone the as i a european constitution necessary and believes that this charter if beef can must for the preamble the a such constitution would the demand must support that the european parliament according the normal parliamentary procedure that like say through consultation a believe can give on the content the the document
given the institutional debate is the the essential important that the charter included the in the  so the the  rights for everyone guaranteed are and so by the member or by the union itself the necessary policies developed can be to the rights actually the implement to to without favour to do the the existing law
we can namely only but the that the law the question and supply in the internal market the to strong does apply the expense the all other rules which the social rights and the fundamental often with being be into
score statements without specific result have we already enough given
our first priority must than also to are this charter a strong legal status to to
further is the now present text content given vague and inadequate he the a number points deficit
in the first place can the on the the differences between the german and the french translation the necessary question the be the the references to religious or spiritual values
itself am i that convinced that a in religious respect neutral text a certain  and topical gentlemen has
i regret than also the obscurity the the elected terms as the lack the a more reference to the allow nature the the text
in the second place the the right the work not directly mentioned
a any has the right to work everyone will the agree agree are that this a the very little point is
there is a large difference between the access to work not ban and action take to work possible to make
in the charter had the right the work clear formulated must be what fact also applies for the right the housing that also in very redundant terms formulated is which hardly only protection service can be
this charter must improve to be and us parliament must a strategy proposals the basis which the text recognition and enriched can be
i suggestion not that there in the charter things are which i can agree
same things are also already in the national constitutions in the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and in the european social charter
there the in the charter also many not despite the fact that this is the from the trade the environmental and organisations the stand for the human
this makes the charter to a unnecessary document
a  that the impression gives that there something constructively is regulated but that this in reality not does
the is also a legal confusion document which the powers the the european court for the rights the the human in strasbourg be  by the european court the justice in luxembourg
in this form is the charter not more than a  to to let see how good the is that there a european union there which any fortunately one to are
the or not the national powers the the member the but the add for the inhabitants the europe nothing to
without amendments the the emphasis more the the social fundamental and environment can i not agree with the accept the a charter
the charter the the fundamental the the european union is a important step to from to make what the general common values the the european union are
however i i i the vote abstained and the to the next reasons

in the charter are important fundamental included
in are current form meets the the important areas not the my demands on social justice
as is the right the work and housing there not in included
also the the social obligations the smallholders the property is not there
today was there already said that the charter the basis the a european constitution can are
more to more is the conditions the fundamental social rights essential

the charter is the result the the work the a public  and broad restricted convention
the the drafting the documents the such fundamental important is that doubt a step forward
however the the objective the the european union a union the peoples and their citizens to are the not achieved
if the charter expression must give the the common values the the peoples the the european union must the by the peoples also can be discussed
the must therefore by the european council the nice not be approved and become the summit must a european debate on the charter the the to
i see the a opportunity to further form to give the a europe the the peoples and the citizens the to involve

in the charter be farreaching rights formulated but lack the corresponding duties the citizens can the rights than also not claim
the pursued europe the the citizens must that possible make
to the reasons i i i the the vote in the plenary sitting the the european parliament abstained
i i before the charter the the fundamental voted if intent
the  are not the discussion and must by everyone to be supported
there will not shift place in the balance between the eu and the member
the charter is a  that the position the the eu views with particularly for those the to the greater europe want join
we must us however firm continue oppose against a campaign before a legal binding charter because such charter only lead to legal uncertainty
this document whether the clear not for a legal binding status because the not legal text is
pt i i i the the vote on the charter the the fundamental abstained because i first like know what destiny this document the the european council the nice to wait the before i the implies or reject
will the clauses in the future a purely  gentlemen have or will they other for the community institutions and therefore also for the european citizens binding are
we know the  the this parliament
the those the the european federalism as this  if the first the to a future european constitution which the national constitutions the the member must be adapted their attitude verdict there not to
they do their best to a vague and general text on fundamental from quality view a total other political interpretation to give the is also still but the question or this document all sense has in a eu the not serious deficits some or what the legislation the or the the area the the defence and the application the the mentioned rights
fortunately seems the majority the the national governments the way the the healthy sense to path the most favour namely for a charter with a purely political gentlemen without any binding nature
the large political debate on the charter will therefore first under the national governments be settled and only then in the parliament when the faced the with the decision the the governments this
hence that i in agreement with what i the the beginning the this vote i explained far not choice i i can i only but abstained
the sv the before text on a draft the the fundamental the the european union contains many important and for the principle the the human dignity essential wordings the we swedish christian the i welcome
because in the swedish hell and  councils many doubt there on the extent which the charter effective legal binding can be and the eu the all expectations can meet the the union says to can achieve i i decided to i the vote to abstained
in the debate that today here in the parliament the held on the charter the the fundamental the the human has the representative the the commission said that this charter a first step was to a legal binding document
the few exceptions after has a whole series speakers report made the the need the a europe that blessed is with constitutional rights
this words confirm the fear the in my country live that this charter intended is if prelude for a european constitution
our  the mr ahern has recently clear said that the european charter the the fundamental the the human a political document must to continue and not legal document must are
members the the irish government have recently questions the on a possible threat the the irish identity by brussels the mr ahern has the again stressed that the eu the ireland the essential important is for the prosperity and the economic success the the country but he has the also strong opposition against a rapid shift in the direction the a more federal more centralised europe because this many further is than the most europeans currently wish or prepared are to accept
given the position that ireland if country its and accordance the wish the my electorate must i than also against this charter the the fundamental the the human vote despite the fact that the charter the this at a simple political statement is is there proof to on that the intended is if prelude for a european constitution the more weight will have than the irish constitution and the like the the irish people
i i very very certainly against the charter the the fundamental voted that us is presented
i i that in the first place done to the antidemocratic process the discussion to to which this document the result is
the the beginning to the end has the drafting the this text the given to a series unexpected dubious decisions
a dubious surprise the semantic nature was us immediately already the beginning the the process to wait when sought was to a name for the body which this charter from is
the the summit the cologne was a forum set that the later itself has designated to convention that is a very unfortunate elected term the does think the the year and the acts the during the french revolution in name the a other convention are committed
the a unexpected dubious decision can we also speak when the is on the role the the national parliaments
the obligations the are down in this text which the final version is up by a obscure effectively unambiguous will by the european court the justice the the citizens the our countries imposed be without that ratification by our national parliaments has place while the however on a exclusive competence have the the area the the human
and what the members in the european parliament the their is not only the right denied amendments in to must to the the the text the the charter but also a choice behind between adopt or reject the the resolution in its whole what counter against the most basic rules the the democracy
reiteration the and very worrying the is finally also the decision a number fundamental from the text way to let
as is the very basic and very fundamental right the the child to to life the are father and mother not in the text included although this emphatically is the by a number 
also the not less fundamental and not less totally combinations right the the forms the a nation is no
any reference to the religious legacy the our nations is removed although the legacy however expressly mentioned the in the most constitutional texts which our national normalised based are as the french constitution which referred the to the  in the original text the the charter was this religious heritage the mentioned but the is with particularly gave as seems the for the pressure the representatives the the matter level the few member the the completely irrational grounds the the itself justified demand the neutrality have as if a ban the any religious reference the the area the the public services
this type processes always the always from the jiggerypokery and that has there end to led that the the understanding religious heritage the europe same gentlemen is granted if the the concept free entrepreneurship and the promotion of
and the is not difficult to councils what the both concepts the prevail will to
the rule the consensus can in this type situations not taken be applied that that the from the  choices the the this principle the result can are
fundamentally has the text the the charter nothing what own is the europe
in this form would the document by any country where also the world adopted can be
the is inevitably the this type processes they fill always from in texts the necessarily are between the the the lowest lowest
this whole operation has not only a illegal nature the the european union has because not few competence the the area the the human the but is also content given fact hardly the important because the freedoms the the citizens in europe already therefore guaranteed be by the constitutional texts the our nations and by the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the fundamental freedoms
a dubious procedure exclusion the many the areas confusion on the nature the the text the the is already with already a rather shocking picture which the heralded visible be the a new totalitarianism that the is in the heart the the european integration
this a
mrs the president this document the the mr marinho is the beginning the the future european criminal
the pensioners are those the a strengthening the the criminal not only the national level but also the european level crime is unfortunately not more only a matter the our states but also the people the other nationalities
pensioners and elderly are more than other groups the victims the crime not the largescale crime and the laundering the money that of from is that combat we but the the the arising small crime the us the life as difficult makes especially that the elderly
we have us night into on four drafts the the have the the fight against the organised crime on the whole taken are we welcome with this texts already is there the necessary the to things the the reports and the amendments the the european parliament
in two respects to this texts with other line
in the first place complement they other the because they all the have the enlargement the the powers the europol institution the a provisional unity for judicial cooperation improvement the the mutual assistance between the member and tightening the the rules the fight the the laundering the black money a practice the the result or precisely the cause is the many the very serious offences or the in any case a essential link is
in the second place are already this texts based the initiatives the member they the the or with the third pillar or with article the the treaty areas which the initiative the the commission not exclusive is
moreover would i what this the still want say that in the during the this partsession in total seven reports dealt be the are resulting from national initiatives from that the that this system this where the the application is very productive can are
also lead the to a form the cooperation which more respect there for the national interests as that from the initiative the the french republic on the mutual assistance in criminal the subject the the  the which a good balance is found between mutual assistance and respect for the fundamental interests the the member
this initiatives have we in large lines supported except this where the by the european parliament tabled amendments the texts a to strong federalist nature agreement to to
we regret however the very the committee to the commission the a fifth text the  on the two initiatives the the french republic the at are the the reduce the illegal immigration
the arguments the the european parliament has forward are completely misleading
our sitting like the simply all that interfere and has simply a if the this type decisions while the however the core forms the the responsibility the the states have when the is to the protection the their peoples
to the at which the treaty the amsterdam fully in force into will are has the european parliament fortunately not more than a consultation role the this area but however see the still again opportunity a wrong fulfil to give the the role by the good decisions to block
i i i this year already expressed on the proposal to amendment the the directive the on the laundering the money
after the european parliament earlier already the attention had located the the shortcomings the this directive is the commission recently with a proposal has which account taken the with the the and comments the the parliament
the common position the the council is officially not know
the report which we today debate is in the longer the the agreements the are made during the european council the tampere in october on the fight the the laundering the money a scourge which annual between the and the the the global gross domestic product involved is
the french presidency has this issue if a the are priorities the the political agenda the by means the a package legislative measures seeks the french presidency than also a sufficient over legal framework to create to the crime the the laundering the money the to tackle
one the proposed the powers the europol from to extend to the laundering the money karamanou hand the a series measures recommended to the international cooperation the the area the mutual assistance in criminal to promote 
both reports are today in vote the and in both cases i i for voted
what the this the that has the the the in the common action  in established principle the the mutual recognition the national measures at the identification detection freeze adopted and common the resources and proceeds the crime in the report the proposed this principle also the application to explain the decisions the viewed the the legal procedure with particularly to the the competent authorities possible to make quickly to act order evidence to data and simple on to to helen in up to take
this speedy measures are completely essential to with success the fight to can fairly with this phenomenon that in extent remains increase and more and more a international nature the
the laundering the money is closely out with the organised crime
laundering must be eradicate where the the also happens conclusion the the european council the tampere
i i than also a voice issued for the this and i am the my support from for the efforts the the french presidency
although we the fight against the laundering the money support and the need that recognise that the on authorities on the necessary instruments for this objective can have can we not for the this vote
since this report just if the  and  the today also in vote be the a coordination the the national criminal procedures presupposes for the the the a criminal framework for the laundering the money the the indirectly the step to the construction the a common european system with courts police judges law etc this development can and want we not support
the fight against the laundering the money happening in each case the different levels and in first body find we the the the a criminal framework the the level the the union for this objective unnecessary
the is doubt sense and necessary the laundering the money to combat
the opinions on the way which that must done are however divided
as caused the the the  in this framework basic problems for the law
the the the  is contrary with the good reasonable national systems the the the provision the the punishment a margin offer
the penalties must between be adapted but not uniform made
against the background the fundamental considerations on law and democracy must the determine the the penalties if core the the national sovereignty the the member be left
i am the the i agree with this report
in were in tampere already proposals done for a special approach the the fight against the laundering the money
in the aware that tax and duties the serious forms the crime still more a role play has the european council the member asked full mutual legal aid to to the the into and prosecute the this type crime and to to to harmonisation the the criminal and the procedures on the laundering the money
there was the based that the principle the mutual recognition also must to apply for legal recommend the be issued before the actual process with particularly for the recommend which the competent authorities quickly evidence in safety can to and up can to the easy  property
through this initiative the the french presidency for to to to to the adopt the a framework for the harmonisation the the criminal and the procedures on the laundering the money as detection freeze and adopted the money
the adoption the this report and the french initiative will doubt a tool are in the fight against the laundering
the border between affairs do and  is often difficult to draw
drug arms illegal landfill the waste surprise the consumers with products the bad quality secrecy and tax make doubt a contribution the the often discrepancy economic growth
however to they clear in against the interests the the humanity and the conservation the us environment
the right the property seems almost sacrosanct
that was a century ago as and after the what was number is the now again fully back
therefore is everything what the better possible makes to language the illegal financial practices to  a step forward
time the this subject opportunity for strengthening the the european police
sometimes seems the the if this objective important is than the fight the the 
such cooperation would in the practice the agree mainly can be used for other purposes than the fight the the laundering the money
that has negative consequences for the rights the citizens the the not guilty make the this form the crime
the best solution is therefore full public the the make the banks and other companies and the develop the a democratic control on the economy
i wish my socialist mr the mr marinho congratulate with are excellent report on the up the the fight against the the international scale laundering the money and against the organised crime
crime is a the the affairs which our electorate the many ensure make and a large number the them take that there but one place is where criminals belong behind finally and command we must the crime and the causes that hard tackle so our citizens the all in europe the manchester to madrid safe know and optimum against criminals be protected
the laundering the money encourages the trade in drugs
the existing eu is clear not sufficient to the electricity money the each year world the laundered the to apparently is the here to a amount the billion dollar the to with
we are the than also the i agree with the initiative the the french presidency that the address the the improvement the the cooperation between national authorities the responsible are for the approach the the laundering and the formulate the uniform penalties
all member must the laundering the money to deal if crime which a  the four year prison the
this week will there in the european parliament voted be on still a number other measures the taken be in the framework the our approach the the international crime
we would like the fight the the heavy international crime included see in the tasks the europol the european unity for cooperation the the area the the police
we want also the legal barriers lift the selfindulgent work the the extradition the alleged criminals the be accused the laundering or other this runs offences the the have the the illegal possession the money
this is a important instrument which criminals in very europe can be tried
this reports are the large important if we the internal market not  for criminals want let be
the last what we want is that the internal market a such nature has that criminals this market unprecedented through the back can 
this by socialist meps drawn measures are a important step in the fight the the international crime and i urge there than also strong the the parliament the the this reports to support
karamanou a
mrs the president i i for the karamanou voted that a another important objective in the fight the the crime voices namely the up the a european police
i beginning however to doubt because a few days ago said a pensioner mrs   against i my  is stolen when i the streets was
close looked i a when are with european when the are  and i early him why is you not behind the  the the my  has stolen
the when said i but we have the principle the  in the national powers the subsidiarity
the  was italian therefore a italian when must behind him the
i am the future european when
i hope that that not reality the
who will the say
although we the report will support have we british conservatives with particularly reservations the a number aspects the the report to know enlargement the vote the qualified majority what europol the will the council act with a twothirds majority accordance article the the relevant treaty article member paragraph b amendment centralisation the the power the europol the court the justice will the over have to judgement to do the a dispute or conflict between member on the interpretation or application the the agreement article member paragraph d amendment
although i the reinforced cooperation between the police the the member both between if through europol welcome part i the ensure the the rapporteur on the fact that europol deficiencies in democratic accountability
now the laundering the money all the world huge forms favour is the clear that europol the ability must are to this practices the combat to a european strategy to develop for police and judicial cooperation
the is however the large important that the national parliaments and the european parliament access have to information on the activities the europol to the political accountability safe to to and ensure to ensure that there a role is play for the european court to the the way the judicial accountability to guarantee
 a
mrs the president i i for the  voted also this is a document that the crime like combat by the  the to apply
what that the must i say that there last saturday in curno where i live a long list elderly and pensioners for the bank was where they any month their pension to collection
a the them the last in the list while i and early i why the here as such long list
i i to information asked and its the next answer given with the new standards must they control or there money from is the illegal activities
that makes i not from said the women legally or illegal i take my  however the the
i hope not that the implementation the this document such consequences will have
the parties the i here represent the eusko eusko and the   the with are fully behind the  on the improvement the the mutual assistance in criminal in the particularly the the area the the fight the the organised crime the laundering the the yield the crime and the financial crime
we support also the future adoption the a agreement the simplification the the fight the the organised crime and the laundering the money as the various measures the are proposed to the objectives to achieve
the idea to a area the freedom safety and justice in europe to the to to is course a to that we fully parts
the strict reduction the the motives for refusal the mutual assistance to fundamental interests the by the member be forward which the now current concepts if sovereignty public item and national safety saying be been is according us although a step in the good direction but still not sufficient
with particularly because we the still unacceptable consider that a member a general important can invoked to judicial cooperation in criminal to refuse
this shows agree to more the that the member still very what must learn the the area the the shared sovereignty
if representative the basques and  must i there also the point that there the still the the the cooperation between member but that the from the view the lost that there in the european union also other police active are the not under the the the
this report and the european area the freedom safety and justice in the general to that from that the democracy and the rule a mainstreaming in the european union are
on the future the the judicial cooperation in the european union concerned the i than also very that some countries  want introduce the borders the a violation the the human
the will you all know are that the spanish government a  in the has the which the penalties for certain types crime be disproportionately
in this special legislation be example  the ten year introduced for children from year to the other measures but to silent
ladies and gentlemen we are that convinced that europe the by us as often discussed area the freedom safety and justice to the must to
we are if first prepared our shoulders include to to
i i however the the  the in various countries example in spain where the party party the the power is be introduced now there a certain situation crime anniversary this reforms are a from threat for the europe the the freedoms and the democracy
i am the the i agree with the report the mrs roure on a another initiative the the french presidency the up the the cooperation the legal area to ensure to ensure that there not obstacles be raised the prevent the the extradition the alleged criminals the be accused the laundering or other this runs offences the the have the the illegal possession the money
in the draft the proposed not to to are that the secrecy the used if reason to refusal the a request the a other member to information on someone the the suspected the involvement the a financial crime
also is the the intention that member the request detailed information give on all accounts the suspects
the objective the the new treaty is the member to force action to take the suspicious transactions
 a
mrs the president this document where i for i voted like step for step and little the little a common european judge up
there the indeed a time team up that there from representatives the the judges or the the  with a legal function from our fifteen member
i had however hoped that in this team also representatives the the lawyers from the fifteen member would be included the is a good idea to not only the judges the sworn but also the lawyers with a long experience the this area a voice to give if there a new legal institution must be up
and i say this not only because my daughter just with excellent figures its training to lawyer has concluded
the reject intention the the  to the judicial cooperation to institutionalising and to  by the up the eurojust is based the a problematic point
there is not one but there are fifteen different cultures and fifteen different legal in the eu
the integration the this different legal in the caved will lead to a  and obscure system that nor the problems which the member faced be will can solve
we are also strong opposed against the ambition to the the eu a rule to make by the up the bodies which the legislative executive and legal power equal and independent addition other there
also in the future must the member if reconciliation the core the the european cooperation to forms
therefore vote we against the report
 a
mrs the president this is the only report where i against i voted
i i no said against this document because i surprised was in the explanatory the mrs langenhagen to read that the the implementation the this programme that million euro has about not the correct procedures are applied
unfortunately the the that few members the the committees the responsible were for the allocation the the european  in the sectors hunting and fishing itself interests had in this into
i think therefore that we many better must careful how us money for research the spent
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
turkey continuation
the the mr the president if member the the joint parliamentary commission euturkey matters i i close with the accession the turkey are
in the particularly like i today the emphasis to the the request the the mr morillon to the  forum the the parliament in to to also like i the national parliaments the our member ask a public debate on the accession the turkey to to
that is important for turkey but in the particularly for the member itself and for our citizens
in helsinki have our governments agree agreed turkey prospect the accession to give
that decision has the population surprised many have there still still not understanding for
also the own citizens the because not proves is the the without knowledge the affairs and without knowledge the the different the the decision the helsinki on this subject about
as the a  the the union the with the view the the many turkish immigrants the already the us live and the growing xenophobia not can and not must afford
my turkish mr programmes from the large turkish parliament complain the also on the fact that obviously no the the national governments or parliaments but also almost no the the european institutions with them like talk
course are there informal discussions official contacts are there however almost not
the seems the or there a type  programmes agreement there that on the accession the turkey only all the about
why the fear
was the decision the helsinki than however hurriedly
the initial euphoria the the council and the commission is clear has
the the area the the political criteria has turkey the intent made but not fundamental progress made
almost a year after helsinki is the now more to important that we the in our national parliaments and with our citizens on the  the turkey have
that are we both turkey if our own population owe such a debate can perhaps also contribute the the integration the the the us living immigrants from turkey
the sv mr the president if turkey member would are the the eu would the after germany the member are with the most inhabitants
the would the first member are the geographical the gap with asia  and a mainly islamic tradition has
unfortunately is the country not only large but democratic given 
already this factors show the that the request the turkey to accession to the eu a the the most issues for the future the the eu is
the periodic report the the commission on the enlargement late progress see but also large shortcomings what the the democracy the human and the treatment the ethnic minorities as the kurds
turkey is still not as far if the had hoped
torture take there still still place and the military play a many to large political role
also the role the turkey the cyprus is unacceptable
my task is the represent the the  in the commission control
than is the course on the economy
from economic view are poverty inflation and a deficit general problems as the such social distribution the the economic growth
the this area are structural reforms need
the  is on the enlargement the the powers the the european investment and the mandate for investment in turkey
institutional given is this issue based the the customs where turkey already reasonable long to one
the customs must however strengthened be with through the a special action the the european investment because turkey what the bank the still not to the group countries one the preaccession can to
we find the the large important that the eu through the eib the development active supports so turkey soon a specific process can start to to meet the the criteria the copenhagen
therefore must the demand for democracy and human also to expression to in the financing the the eib
in the practice means that the possibility to to loans to provide the projects in turkey to a amount the million euro
turkey is in different connections although already in eligible for loans but now like the commission the up the economic growth with particularly what the the infrastructure to the competitiveness the the country to increase
i like addition the formal aspect a principle comment make on the procedure
the is a procedure the consultation but a codecision would course more are because this decisions to can lead that the budget adapted must be
this applies with particularly in this stage which we gradually still more resources the the eib use without that we the taken economic risks fully cover
if the eib loans provided the countries outside the member must there consultation committed be with the parliament on the priorities the the must be the this part the the activities the the bank that mainly the the by the foreign policy
the budgetary problem is the this at that the margin the remains in the reserve the the guarantee danger to disappear
we extend the tasks the the investment from but we increase not in equal extent the reserve for the guarantee the loans the the budget also have we the the us taken to to finance if a loan not repaid can be
the remaining  is now as low that the union the eib the agree not longer if instrument danger to can use if there new events place the such investment need make
despite this concern the the commission control however for that the parliament the proposal the the commission approves
we are however behind the critical position the the rapporteur that there currently a effective assessment there the the loans the the eib provided and that there shortcomings are what the the public and democratic control the the activities the the bank
we vote however for because we the important find to the to to the a more positive development the the areas which turkey still still deficiencies in this case with particularly the economic area
the mr morillon has a good report written which the stressed that religious any or geostrategic considerations the accession the turkey determine
if turkey like meet the the criteria the copenhagen must the not only the constitution but also are political and intellectual inspiration reform
in western have ideas on pluralism and different identities within a and same the led to the recognition the rights the the area the culture language and political and to decentralisation
turkey must this modern european concepts with the to diversity and the right the religious on to take
the ideology the kemal was modern in but is that not more in the year
hence my amendments on the need to a political solution for the population the the kurds
the is unacceptable that the commission in the document on the accession the not few way report has made the the kurds despite the fact that they the frustrated in a series regular reports also has the mr verheugen them morning mentioned
i hope that the parliament and the council this omission objectives will make
turkey and the european union are there not the both the might this subject the main cause the the bad reputation the turkey the the area the the human with a large into to were the the criteria the copenhagen the not met if there not solution is for the kurds
i i than also a appeal the the parliament to my amendments the to take the council and the parliament question i clear to to that a solution for the kurds the key is which the problems the the turkish within the the criteria the copenhagen can be resolved
the fr mr the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner if member the the delegation for the three countries the the southern caucasus the georgia armenia and azerbaijan the endorse i the full the report the the mr morillon and in the particularly paragraph which the turkish government the called the relations with the neighbouring in the caucasus to improve
the relations between turkey and azerbaijan should than the good are that can the not said be the the relations between turkey and armenia the turkish government use its economic boycott against this country what unacceptable is now turkey the status the candidate the the european union has obtained
there must a end to the the dispute on the recognition the the  genocide so the diplomatic and economic relations day can be that is more to more the important this turkey a role favour in the plans for the instance the a  between the caspian sea and the turkish   the the mediterranean sea
turkey will in are plans also a place must implication for the environmental with particularly the the construction the large  and other similar projects the always the influence are the the water the the neighbouring
the el mr the president i like general morillon the i congratulate with are report in the extent which the circumstances him that  has he here a balance report the know to make
we know all how difficult the is to under such problematic circumstances the head to offer the political and economic opportunism and the all interests which indicate and rules not entitlements and which usually the method the two standards and two strident the applied
therefore i i appreciation for the made the from the  clearly although a what less  wording the certain paragraphs i i a more picture would have given the the elements the the the assessment the the turkish progress in the direction the accession a role play i i the with particularly the the conclusion in paragraph which the that turkey not the the criteria the copenhagen meets
let we not forget that turkey repeatedly is condemned because are idle the the area the the human and the democratic freedoms and more general because are international behaviour the european parliament has also this country repeatedly invited the to comply the the relevant european values
in the considerations g and h and the paragraphs and the although expressly referred to the flagrant violations the this values by turkey and by with particularly the turkish occupying the cyprus that turkey kind asked the back to draw the but we had there i i however better the done clear the historic and current responsibility the the denounce to to the turkey bears for many problems i mention here the absolute stand the turkey in the issue cyprus which a desperate situation is the
than would we because a many clearer message have sent the the forces in turkey the to to real modernisation than would we them have help the the creating the the for their european to necessary conditions and would we possibly also those on the progress have can draw the now still with serious arguments the  the this to deny
the el mr the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes as the presidentinoffice president the the council morning already said is this a extremely topical debate this is because together with the presentation by the commission the the reports and the with particularly the report for turkey and the proposal for a partnership with this country
this is the first serious step in the accession the turkey this is the first step for the practical application of
us i must we this welcome that are
how otherwise turkey also may are than many european country turkey is and remains a the part the the european reality
the old syria can not just a progress to by the turkish presence in the life the the european countries
if europe the fails turkey with very are religious to accept and welcome in are central the to take will the i i a enormous political and cultural leap to the make
than will europe proof that are values universal are and not torn the destruction the other identity but the incompatible and respect the other views and identity
incompatible presupposes however the there the a common soil
our rapporteur has in are indeed excellent report which i him the i thank this common soil under words the and presented the turkey this common soil is democracy
democracy presupposes free expression and for all equal human and political rights irrespective ethnic origin democracy means training the a government after free elections and if i say free elections mean i real free elections real free elections are however incompatible with the there the autonomous power very certainly when this power the are in the military structures
if there something is which we more had should expect the the  is the the this issue
we had perhaps with more clarity can say that turkey never a fully working democracy will are or never will can join as not short shortcomings be made with this even constitutional the military superpower
democracy is incompatible with institutionalised political functions the the force and is course also incompatible with interference the the army in the political life with or without constitutional considerations
course must the the a democratic country  behaviour expect towards are neighbours very certainly when this neighbours future partners are
therefore the rightly the bombardment the  by the turkish force condemned and the the turkish government there rightly the reminded that they compulsory is without previous conditions the negotiations between turkish and turkish to promote
we are concern on the fact mr the president that we or the turkish authority or the turkish media encouraging noises in the direction hear
rather see we that the the my marketing i hope that turkey this matter still agree seriously will look and will recognise that the obligations has
mr the president the is regret that us debate here today the  by a small number hostile amendments
this are tabled by the tdi the group and others
i think they inappropriate respect and wrong and also to they the the wrong at i think this because there in this amendments three words be used genocide muslim and asian and the the a racist  discriminatory way the to lead that there harmonize and as obstacles be raised against the turkish accession to to union
muslims are those the a the the three developing which  a important role plays
the islam is the brother the the christianity and the 
asian is in this context a unfortunate racist term the as quickly possible must to disappear
what the genocide the turkey is not responsible for the  bloodbath
if we find that turkey the responsible is to we than the debt for all crimes the the  rich the the turkey the now
the convention the was because not mandate to there the  tragedy under to let the
to the far is believe i not that this parliament the otherwise must the to to
i welcome the cautious progress the turkey the way to accession to the union the i to and i support the commission and the 
the fr the accession the turkey to the european union is more than ever a topical issue
i am not to those the religious motives argue to this prospect the to point but i think the that this issue more is than a simple mere
i objective than the the recognition the the  genocide in
now france presidentinoffice president the the union is has the french senate recently last half year after the french second chamber the important step to recognition the
recognition the this genocide means however not that the current turkey a pray country is
contrary a country can there only but better the be when the are past under view dare to see
but how credible would europe still are in are condemnation the statute including genocide which governments all the world the guilty make when the turkey with open poor would received and the acts from the past would 
further is the downright disgusting and completely unacceptable that the kurdish people still still not recognised the and still still the persecution being
the member leyla zana the who the sakharov is granted is in imprisoned the only and only because they in the turkish parliament in the kurdish about had and they is still still behind the bars
us parliament has repeatedly the this affairs out and there is not few reason to that now not to do
the sv mr the president in paragraph the the  the the that the european parliament the turkish government to stated to are still from northern back to draw
i i this wording itself written by means the amendment that the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence the october has approved
i like i in the particularly up to commissioner verheugen the responsible is for the enlargement and to the french presidency
almost the cyprus is occupied by foreign troops that like say turkish soldiers
you is today the day since the fall the the berlin wall the only split capital the europe
the island the  paul and   cyprus is in the history never earlier into been but is that since year by a foreign invasion now the
the four freedoms the the eu can if result the the divide not for very cyprus apply
can turkey all with the negotiations initiate without that the four freedoms also for cyprus apply
must you not one city are and cyprus one country
must the still not way
in previous speeches is the genocide in armenia mentioned
the was only year for hitler and the second war place when hitler the destruction the the jews in the created
he referred time itself to this genocide if a forget chapter from the history
turkey must the truth under view see
the the mr the president ladies and gentlemen the mr morillon has in are report in recital d a important indication given which i believe that they in this debate a important role must play
according the mr morillon must turkey try the european union not if a exclusive christian club to see the turkey like out
versa means this that the european union expressly must say that we not exclusive christian club are the turkey the on the religious or  arguments like can or must out
we must expressly say that a the with mainly islamic inhabitants and a  constitution the supports the freedom equality and tolerance the values which the european union itself is develop a enrichment for the european union can are
the union supports not the religious but the values the they the the enlightenment to thank has the values find whole independent the the religious choice the a human or a the and are inhabitants commit in the constitutions the the member and as today during the debate on the charter the the fundamental is has in the vision the the european union the the fundamental
if democratic law with intelligibility and fundamental values as we they know is turkey a enrichment for the european union
from the report the the mr morillon that however also that turkey far the the demands from is
i give to that the criteria the copenhagen economic criteria are however have they the the the points
the question is in what tolerance democratic law intelligibility and respect the intelligibility in turkey reality are
as also from the report the the mr morillon that is that not in sufficient extent the case
the necessary progress is still not made turkey must the further make
the el mr the president we discuss not on the way which the european union in turkey will be included but on the way which turkey in the european union will be included where i the personally fully that agree am
i i the the report the the mr morillon the way the ways the into can done
therefore address i i to the commissioner and the presidentinoffice president the the council and i like their questions why they not inspiration from this report draw the they say however that they the there fully that agree are the to the text on the partnership the to complement the the because with not floor reference on the need the a content debate with turkey on issues as the kurds cyprus and a men society a society without threat the the neighbouring the turkey
what the issue the the genocide the the armenia the am i the there fully that agree that this not condition must are for accession
here discuss we however on what what we want say and what we us remind
turkey will only really a democratic country be if the has learnt with are past to to to as the democratic germany to has must learn to with are past and where we time also to had asked
the the mr the president i thank the mr morillon for this report the the demonstrated the insight and is clear
the mr morillon makes clear how turkey still the the within the the criteria the copenhagen from is also lists he the additional conditions the which turkey still must meet
as have we the issue cyprus the role the the turkish army and in the particularly the the national security which the power contrary is with the democratic principles but especially also the kurdish issue and not in the last place the heavy conflict with greece that also the initiative the turkey must be tackled
the mr verheugen has here said that in the first place the political criteria must be fulfilled
you know all that our group very sceptical the the allocation the the status the candidate was the am us however that now the status a fact is turkey to reforms must decisions to the the conditions the the european union to meet
turkey is itself responsible
i think the the high inflation the more than had and today still more than is there is the high debt if result the the congestion the the  by military expenditure and by the military conflict with the pkk
 prime anap anap expect that turkey already in the the criteria the maastricht will meet that is according i already to optimistic
turkey must there the the aware are that the way difficult is that the sovereignty must give and that the the must make
we want the the the way hand the not assignments and especially our financial obligations fulfil
the fr mr the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes i like in this debate the floor to in my capacity the rapporteur for the accession the cyprus
now turkey and cyprus both candidate are for accession to the european union the the components more that the cyprus a domestic political problem the the be is
commissioner verheugen has confirmed that the cyprus a important role plays the the negotiations the currently with turkey held be
that can also difficult otherwise given the political and military influence the turkey in the northern part the cyprus
we must our rapporteur the mr morillon there grateful for are that he the solution the the cyprus a the the conditions has mentioned for the accession the turkey
no as writing he would understand that cyprus in two shared remains by a wall which there the last decade fortunately so other cases are
the  wall must indeed down be and this must turkey without the resolutions the the security from to to which the country called the are still back to draw from the northern part the the island
in paragraph the our resolution the this request explicitly formulated
the is high time that turkey listening to the turkish powerfully the in large majority the disputes from the past want  and the together with their  citizens want with the europe
if turkey however food remains give the the to to independence or even norms the the  regime the northern will that to result have that the negotiations failure and this will the turkish government responsible are
the medium term would a such drafting a impossible own are for the accession the turkey
the a the the three in the  mentioned conditions a condition the by the european parliament certainly adopted will be would in that case still still not are met
as the regime in ankara presented that the status unacceptable is for europe and for the rest the the world will there long progress made can be the unity the the island will restore can be and in the near future will a comprehensive fair sustainable regulation to the the can be the in agreement is with the international right
mr the president this resolution on the turkish progress the the way to accession to the eu contains many commendable elements i objective here with particularly the the call the the commission to the preparation the the accession sufficient resources the available to to
but where remains the thanks reception the the decision the helsinki to turkey  to to
where is the recognition in the resolution the the considerable efforts and i quote here from the explanatory the the resolution the considerable efforts the turkey has made to better meet to to the the requirements the the european union
what is the fact unfortunately that turkey not during the debate on enlargement the the eu together with the other candidate is discussed
course should peoples the kurdish origin and other cultural and linguistic minorities not subject be the political economic or other discrimination course must they the possibility have to the freely to express but this expressions should only but place the peaceful way and without intimidation and terrorism
we must not forget that the cannot the turkey the the western fact a at the the disastrous the time the the cold war was and that the pkk was supported if instrument to this policy giving to give
where in this resolution the the demand that the representatives the minorities the violence must 
peace between the citizens between is a condition for investment and economic progress
the terrorism has a such progress in the way been
we must there also not doubt on let there that the solution the extremely difficult problems as cyprus a solution the asking to the permission the all inhabitants the cyprus not step closer is when turkey the frustrated in are 
per finally the account is turkey together with greece and the united kingdom a the the  the cyprus
i  a increasing  in the parliament where the is to the possible effect the the turkish accession the the union
this can i the to that there also a growing nervousness there under the citizens the a large number the the current member on the pace and the intensity the the political integration within the eu and the left premises in the tissue the this development the still more visible the
how  and  would the not are to to to to a liberal community the nations the freely with other trade introducing and united action the a limited number political areas and how easier would the than not are to a country if turkey in such system a place to give
the el mr the president we can impossible for the  vote we are there namely deeply the convinced that in unlike to what many the also in turkey the say and hope the accession not improvement will to in the living the the peoples
contrary this will fall
what the actual objective is the the resolution that without more from the references to the gross domestic product the turkey to the important part the the turkish trade that for account the the european union is to the liberal economic reforms which the interests the the people be damaged and to the rules the strengthening the the free market the recently by the turkish parliament the insist the the international monetary fund are adopted
a sign the the mandatory is also the pleasure the in the resolution to expression is on the intention the turkey to military potential the available to to in the framework the the common security and defence
with other words turkey will still more be subject the the economic political and military objectives the the big in the european union
we deny absolutely not that there also good comments in the resolution are i think example the the reference to the human although the here tricks the the turkish regime late continue for progress and the fact ignores that there still or political prisoners are in turkey
also think i the the reference to the issue cyprus to the request to withdrawal the the turkish occupying to the need the respect the the statements the the european court as in the matter  to the need the a political solution for the kurdish issue and to the bombing the iraq
we fear however that the the for the another time to pious wish is
why are already this things namely not in the report the the european commission
for us remains the  means in unlike to what many that has turkey with the in decided customs and the in obtained status the candidate for accession the life the are population not can improve
i am that convinced that with the accession and the final accession the citizens their managed will see fall especially the economic and social level
i am there also the convinced that the financing the the accession in what form than also used will be to the repressive mechanisms to strengthen and the current regime the to encourage to continuation the are policy
we refuse also the changes circles in the european union the role to to know the defender the the human their action to now to testify earlier the the opposite
therefore wish we driven by feelings the solidarity with the turkish people us to oppose against accession with other words we are against the reports which this a favour the down
mr the president gentlemen members mr the commissioner as different members today already have stressed have we a long and difficult way to to to the accession the turkey to the european union
different speakers have their ensure expressed on the respect the the human the situation the the minorities with particularly the the kurds the role the the army in the political the system and the death
that are all very serious affairs and we parts this ensure than also fully as moreover also clear that from the last annual the the commission
the the other on believe i that we not a already to hints picture the the situation must give
there are progress made there are encouraging signals visible
the government has a whole series reforms announced and president  has announced the personally to will working for the unity the are country
i i must we the turkish authorities than also encourage everything in the work to to to to meet the the political criteria the copenhagen that is and remains a absolute need
same must we that to to see that the announced measures also really carried be
i believe that the report the the mr morillon exactly this balance recommend
the strategy the in december the the last year in helsinki is the has a new genuinely given the the relations between the european union and turkey
the basis the the balanced approach must we without hesitation continue the the way the lead to more rapprochement between the union and turkey
just say i than also let we demanding continue let we vigilant continue let we our conditions clear express make but let we the also again not subjects
mr the president the the end the this debate like i that point that there course a the there between one the report the the commission on the already than not progress progress in turkey and hand the accession
different speakers from criticism the the fact that the commission certain problems not has the
i can only say that the speakers the report not have read all here mentioned problems the by the commission not would are the be in the report dealt
the is also not as that the kurdish issue not the name the mentioned
where the to the kurdish language culture villages or parties is the course the floor kurdish used
who says that the floor or understanding kurdish not does has clear the report not read
here the the impression raised that the report the the area the terminology the the report different
that is not the case
new is the accession that accession includes a very important provision namely that the candidate the with all issues must deal the in the report on the progress be dealt
there is therefore a the
the accession is a very balanced document that the the conclusions the helsinki supports
i must there the parliament the point that some speakers obviously the wrongly the impression have that the accession already reality is
the is to a proposal i can you today not say or this project ever more will be than a proposal especially not if the parliament comes the certain proposals the here morning and afternoon are done
the is not the i the parliament council to give or to criticise i i that also not
i must you only point the the consequences the certain decisions can have
if you the in cohesion with the accession to the european union on the  issue you the i repeat the  issue in cohesion with the accession to the european union than will the project which we the today have not the start to
also if the conclusions the helsinki with the to the solution the the cyprus the the here by few speakers desired way be amended if more the the solution the the cyprus if condition for accession the the will the project failure
we have the condition in the over year with broad assent the the european parliament let the
the turkey can we only expect that the the serious way everything in the work the to to a solution to to
we should however never forget that there in the search to a solution for this problem two parties are
therefore can the turkey not more be called than serious constructive and credible efforts the solution can you only expect the them the the joint the solution the the problem the objective have the
finally must i there still once the point that we turkey with the  a supply have done
now is the is the first step the the  to achieve i think the unfair the strategy to deal if they now already is failed also already is even the first step still not done
the is there now to the first step to take if members the the european parliament must you decide or we the first step can do or not
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
euromediterranean conferences to marseilles
the the item are the oral questions the the council b and the commission b­ the the mr brok behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the euromediterranean conferences in november to marseilles
who the the questions has tabled the mr brok would normal about the first the floor to but he is in sitting with the president and is as
because we as tight in our time are would i the mr moscovici want questions answer to give the the question before this formally the the because he know the content that
mr the president gentlemen commissioners gentlemen members i will indeed answer give before the mr brok is returned the are sitting with the president because i will itself also still a sitting with its will have
we have us now once to the the a very full agenda
i thank president brok for the fact that he i the opportunity has given here the the the affairs with the to the mediterranean policy the the union to to explain as you know the namely the fourth in marseilles to the conference the euromediterranean ministers the foreign affairs for the door
you know that the french presidency very many gentlemen importance the strengthening the the mediterranean pillar within the foreign relations the the union a subject that the last months also a the our priorities is been
that is also the reason why we that the have that the balance drawn would be the the first five year the the implementation the the process the barcelona the basis of can we in marseilles because the necessary guidelines the
moreover has commissioner patten the i here welcome in are communication new opportunities for the process the barcelona in this the a number interesting mind to the the
the mr brok has referred to the in june in feira adopted common strategy for the mediterranean
the strategy is a important and useful supplement certainly but the and in this respect from they the the euromediterranean partnership that the fifteen member and twelve countries in the southern mediterranean includes the they is especially a type tool the increasing the the internal discipline within the union which the cohesion and the coordination strengthened can be between all community instruments and national policies the the the mediterranean at are
the presidency has the regard the the implementation the this common strategy already a number priorities the the in september on the the council the ministers are presented
the presidency has the in the particularly used to the areas to determine which the union and its partners in the south their efforts would must up with the view the a smap the the process the barcelona the is the with particularly to deepening the the dialogue the political and economic area increasing the the effectiveness the the community support introduction the subregional formulae strengthening the the  and enlargement the the number initiatives the the area the justice and home affairs
the process the barcelona again the the to that is also our objective for the conference the marseilles
the presidency is that from during this  meeting with everyone aid this process new life in to can revive
the seems i unnecessary to here in detail in to to the the political context which this conference place but i am really the opinion agree that in the light the the current problems in the east this euromediterranean dialogue more than ever necessary is
the is than also not because the problematic situation in the east that the expectations the the conference the marseilles to below must be recognition
course am i not that the current context not only effect will have the this meeting
i think than with particularly the the charter the peace and stability that the is been to made discussions between the partners and that probably only adopted will can be when the upon in the region is 
the mr brok the he is now also present the has precisely the this delays in the negotiations the necessary question placed
but is the the to delays
the there not doubt that the a long and sometimes sensitive discussion is the i would even say that is normal certainly given the political situation in the east
the most is i i that we the work continue and that the project not off the
the regard the this charter believe i that the partners determined are this text the to take as the circumstances that allow
let we not forget that the process the barcelona only five year old is
and when we in the partnership  were we us aware aware the the long way the we to to had
the was the not course as strong the other different partners the the one day the the other together to to in the however what unusual cooperation the the process the barcelona certainly also given the the are least said often odds political context
and however are we the managed the dialogue in the to the also the such sensitive areas if stability terrorism emigration and human
you can there certainly the are that we the plan are the this way by to to
this cooperation the the area the political and safety also the the first component the barcelona mentioned is the essential important already aware we that the here to the sensitive issues is the the most time questions
but we must also the other components the barcelona not forget the economic and financial component one and the social cultural and humanitarian component hand
this brings i to a fundamental principle the the mediterranean policy the the union to stress and the give i also directly answer the the question the the mr brok
i objective here the the cohesion and the balance between the lines ways the three mentioned components the parallel develop the cohesion is the basis the the objectives and the unique nature the the process the barcelona the cohesion must we than also maintain
and the must than where are that the economic component how slow the the also development the best work the most is that we the cohesion not from the view lose without the cohesion would the process the barcelona be be to a ordinary development to a new trade which the a political or humanitarian vision for the long term not there is
and that would unfortunately are because our mediterranean partners are our closest neighbours with who we very what common have a heritage a past a culture all contacts and interests
and the mr brok has there already the out there the us a number challenges to wait the the area the racism intolerance and xenophobia itself we joint the fight must draw
there are also many the opportunities to cooperation the the area the the fight the illegal trade in what form than also and the areas if migration and strengthening the the rule
we europeans can us let stand the the necessary experience in this the
the is also in us important our partners to hand the the structural  the must lead to a higher economic level and more competition
the impetus the we in marseilles the the process want give will therefore based must are the all political and economic components the the process the i say the still but agree other make and hand with other linked are
the is where that barcelona a ambitious process is a ambitious partnership that asking to resources the appropriate are the the objectives which the at is
the mr brok touched also the point the the financial resources the
course are the never enough
in the light the the extent the the challenges and the seriousness the the needs the the southern countries will the resources the the union available the always inadequate seem especially this the external obligations the the union the last years excessive are has
as you know is this point repeatedly subject the discussion been in the council and i believe to should say that the also the core is the the reform the the initiative the commissioner patten in the is the
this everything the not way that the council the with particularly since has effort the mediterranean wider resources to to know the more in agreement are with the objectives the the partnership
already in has the french presidency the this used with particularly during the european council the cannes where we the managed are the for the mediterranean policy granted resources more in balance to to with the resources the be granted the the countries the central and eastern
with the idea in the mind is the programme meda i the start has which the appropriations for the period billion euro belonging
now must the  for the period down to be and i can only but hope the figures can i in this stage still not give the that the enough will are to the objectives the the mediterranean policy the the union to achieve
you know that we currently us best do to the fifteen member the one line to to if by the short term a additional meeting the the council in marseilles to the
the this at have we already agreement achieved on the financial provisions the the meda 
i i will we in the future can have on a more more profile and on the whole taken credible instrument
the management the the programme will simplified be and the procedures the the back and payments will up be
further are there course still the loans the the eib the the essential important are for the development the our partner and in the particularly for the large infrastructures
i i will we with a mandate the a few billion euro for the mediterranean for the period in the are the the expectations the our southern partners to meet in the next years what also a absolute need is
now the the eve the the conference the marseilles would the french presidency course like see that this mediterranean priority the the union confirmed the including the financial aspects that
in fact is the not more only as in to the achieve the a balance between this priority and the support the eastern but also to a preparation the the future enlargement the the union
we must not forget that barcelona as all issues the the area the the foreign relations the the union from the nature the matter part part the the acquis community the would than also good are that the countries the mediterranean countries to as if suffer partners because the are the suffer partners the us joint europe
that is a large challenge for the europe the the future which the both the to the east the the continent will move without that the south of adverse consequences must affected
the seems us a reason to more to the important the the mediterranean policy the the union to emphasise the union like because all the world a role the importance can play and the mediterranean is and remains for its than also a need sea other in the come a mare mediterranean
the the mr the president the force the the president the the council that from the fact that he questions has answered the i at still not i the
i thank the french presidency the the council that the trying the barcelona a new impetus to give
this is indeed a extremely important matter i say that if someone the from central is
in central must we recognise that the debate on the barcelona in us common important is as we the  ask to understand that also the enlargement with central and eastern states in us common important is
if we that recognise and in practice to are we the the good way
the is is in us common important the the one on the european union from to extend and the the other on good neighbours to to
the european union like this the necessary budget available to
we questions us course the how the process further must be financed in the framework the the current financial perspectives and account bearing with the all creation growing because the doubt or we that the long term can insist
we hope course that the concept the the mr patten fails and that the commission this projects more can out than in the past the case was
extremely important is that we the benefits the the barcelona recognise the the way can because also in the countries with our aid the necessary economic and social development the the be the to the people in the region programmes perspectives to give
that help also emigration prevent
the term must the in the whole mediterranean the just if in the european union the not done that people from social need must emigrate the wish must the result are the other considerations
we must this a contribution make
if there such economic and social prospects are is the in the countries also a important condition for the respect the the human and the democratisation fulfilled
for us security is that everything course very important
the is not only to more trade and movement but largely to our safety that must we our citizens clear make to them that to do accept
xenophobia mainly and another terrorism have this also that to make i hope that the possible is item the affairs to to
i think also the the situation in some north states which we us in the past large ensure have made and the us also now still concerned i hope that we the succeed all north countries the the process to involve
from the current situation in the near east that still more what measures in the framework the the community policy and the the cooperation need are
i concerned the this opportunity use to the hope from to speak that not the both partners the currently in the near east in a conflict terms are this week a unilateral step does the the extremely difficult would make in the next weeks to the table back to times
we must try to the to to the people in palestine a opportunity the a own development future and the to give that must by a agreement with israel and the basis the guarantees for the the israel done
i hope that the european union in marseilles will decisions the  further to promote i hope also that we together will can ensure for what the mr moscovici rightly mare mediterranean has mentioned
the is to the mediterranean sea the the words which the three large monotheistic developing are the which there now two in a conflict terms are
we must also the the very fundamental basis again with other in discussion can to
the european union has here a important role to play the states and the people in the region programmes wait because the the political influence the the european union the this balance and credibility can to
i hope that the fact that this the expect that we influence exercise and our role play to will contribute that of in marseilles work the made and that we with the necessary credibility the the peace in the region and the our own stability can contribute
mr the president there is as you know a english saying that reads a kind without it is if a bn the  without first deathknell
during the temporary but whole comprehensible absence the my gentlemen friend the the beginning the this debate was i just in the temptation to to say that this a  without innocent would to be but the does i welcome that he now in us central is arrived so he with are large wisdom and large dose healthy sense a contribution can make the this very important debate that place the the initiative the the gentlemen member itself
as the minister just this already said the euromediterranean conference in marseilles the this week take place against the background the the persistent crisis in the peace in the east
we hoped all that the situation the now would have improve and that was also almost managed
many the us were pleased surprised even by the extent the progress the last summer in camp david seemed to be made and we were are praise on everything what president clinton and are government had done to the process again smooth to draw
we were there as near and that makes the problems the tragedy the the last weeks more to sadder
the press the morning and afternoon let still always a far the positive picture see
the problems the now would for us the must are to our efforts the promotion the the cooperation in euromediterranean framework to double
no will try to deny that there a the there between the barcelona and the peace in the east
the breakthrough in the euromediterranean relations in barcelona was partly possible made by the breakthrough in madrid and then by the agreements the oslo
the is also where that the barcelona is delayed by setbacks in the runup to the peace
that is a fact where we unfortunately that must life
we must however not forget that there in the barcelona the last five year the progress are made and that despite all problems in the east
one thing is clear
we should the barcelona not obstruct the the peace in the east
barcelona has are own force
the has are own objectives the whole and already means continue
we have there all important the to this week in marseilles  and ambition the the day to to
the commission know the encouraged by the on the general positive response the our proposals to the barcelona new life in to revive both in the european union if under the mediterranean partners
perhaps must i a short explanatory give the few  from the strategic approach the we have proposed and the to i hope in marseilles in good earth will the
the first is there the up the the negotiations on and the ratification the the agreements
first with egypt but also with algeria syria and lebanon
we have our negotiations with egypt almost months ago concluded and i hope that we now quickly can move to the york the the agreement and then to course time to official signature
i would also like see that we a beginning among with more serious negotiations on agreements with the other countries
we have said that we the sensitive subject the the trade in agricultural must tackle
we must for ourselves look what there need is to ensure to ensure that the agreements the the end the the period fully in agreement are with the standards the the wto
we are before the up the the  by the signature the  between the partners to encourage
in this the is the commission the plan technical assistance to to on important issues if  and 
we want a combination the policy on the internal market and agreements to accumulation the origin in to to addition the subregional  for all partners the a  with other into and the harmonised protocol on the  accept
we want that the region also attractive the for investors
addition the economic reforms will also the recently in the life established  the  bodies and the  the sense help promote just if the introduction the a new regional facility for capital
the achieve the a agreement on a new regional programme for judicial and home affairs including migration in the broadest sense the the floor the fight against the organised crime and cooperation in  is also a subject which we with success the mind hope to exchange
also is there the subject which we in this parliament the several occasions that know i but already to good have can debate the improvement the the implementation the meda
the revision the the  and the already announced reform the the system for external aid the the commission will contribute the this improvement and will there also to lead that there more human resources available to
by the decentralisation the the aid will we the partners many more involve the all stages the the process the policymaking and 
we have there all important the that meda only the objectives our the the must achieve
we want that achieve in close coordination with our partners and that applies for all stages the the process
but we can not across to the fact that the partners the are faced with the problems the now once inherent are the the process our most support deserve
what the human the to we a structural approach for which we look how the countries the there during a certain time the method
but also here must we honest are
a country which the serious doubt the the reputation the the area the the human the democracy and the function the the system a country that also not prepared is this affairs clear to discuss will not easy are place find in the new  and will the the longer term probably less good thriving
i like still just one comment make on meda and the reform the our external aid and this comment is relevant for the debates the the members elsewhere to
to in the mediterranean area and elsewhere in the world more aid to can offer have we as the members will understand more resources need to our programmes in good jobs to lead and the commission has with that objective a number sensible proposals the table the
there are members the find that we this additional resources in reserve must the until certain other objectives are achieved
gentlemen members i believe the honest if i say that there a at is which you us must confidence and us the opportunity must give to us work to do because we our plans with not possibility more the implement can to if the people the we need have to they in good jobs to lead only available to if we have let see that we indeed more can work
the is crazy to that the us to expect and therefore question i all gentlemen members the this influence can exercise if the reform us all seriousness is than must you us however the possibility give to to let see that we our words where can make
can we that not than must we this the consequences the accept and will the commissioner for foreign relations this to course time the consequences from draw but i question you put us not in a position which you the objectives accepts but us only the resources the if we have proven that we the objectives also actually can achieve
a such inevitable is totally nonsense
the is a subject that particularly important is for all countries the the mediterranean sea and i hope them this week reassure to can to that we the the plan are us life what the implementation the our programmes the considerably to clean
i hope that all ministers the in marseilles meet will recognise that this a series realistic proposals is the deserve to be adopted so the barcelona new life can be dialogue precisely now the east with such serious problems to camps has
i will the parliament like the the first opportunity the the happens the the highest to the the results the the meeting in marseilles
we have in the past very many financial resources in this partnership into
we have this resources not always to properly managed but that does nothing the the the informed that the the again how priority the parliament the commission and the council give the the strengthening the the partnership the our 
the next years will the success the this partnership important are than ever and i hope than also that we this week in marseilles and in the weeks then ensure can ensure that this project still more impetus and still more energy the than the in the past
mr the president five year after the conference the barcelona is the time the balance the to make
the european parliament has in march a resolution adopted which the policy and the instruments the the partnership critical were investigated and few substantial corrections be made
the council has in june in feira a common strategy for the mediterranean the and the european commission has recently after the approval the the revised regulation a document on the new start the the process the barcelona tabled
from that everything that the aware that the to now to reached results not sufficient are although the measures to my opinion not adequate response the the situation forms five year is also certainly not many for such complex processes
the process that in barcelona the start is has and that based is the the three pillars the political economy and culture is still characterised been by three restrictions the now general be recognised and the also  in the speech the commissioner patten
the first is that the prefer the given the trade linked the the liberalisation the trade and economy over common development economic integration social policy cultural dialogue training and a good use the the human capabilities
the second reduction the the form the the relations between the european union and the partner in the mediterranean the still often bilateral are something what negotiations difficult and ratification to a longterm process makes
the danger the economy the this countries still more on to be the the trade with the union what the development the  wish also because the partner difficulties affected the the establishment the mutual cooperation
the third reduction the the not involvement the the social civil in europe and the mediterranean the this process that still still to many is centralised and almost whole by the governments the dominated
i i this aspects stressed because the the key is for a new start the the process also must the political agenda the barcelona be extended
the is unthinkable that the agricultural the flows and the debt now not central are in the euromediterranean partnership
i remind remind that the parliament has committed in the spring the a conference on the agriculture to will organise
by the dramatic  the the peace in the east is the scenario in the region completely changed
unfortunately had the european union its whole policy between the a successful conclusion the the agreements the oslo
the common strategy the the council pointed indeed in the direction
the euromediterranean conference the ministers other the tomorrow in marseilles start the faced with a serious situation which the role the europe in the region still  the and the union the encouraged a greater role in the israelipalestinian conflict the the to take
that the partners least to still to have committed in marseilles meet to to is the the already a sign that not everything lost is also already am i the at agree with commissioner patten that the euromediterranean representations not the hostage the the peace must be
i would even say that this in the past a excuse is been for cowardice not only for europe but also for the mediterranean partner
therefore believe i that the debate that we today into also useful can are to us to achieve that this policy central is for the whole union
mr the president ladies and gentlemen we are very welcome with the initiative the the mr brok to this debate for the beginning the the meeting in marseilles to to
as commissioner patten has said undermining the lack the a consolidated peace in the east the whole process that during the euromediterranean conference the the is the in the particularly the correct application the the appropriations the the meda
the group the the european liberal and democratic party supports course the actions the the commission the for the the mediterranean policy that five year ago in barcelona is ones we hope that this policy consolidated can be
during a series meetings the the economic whom recently in barcelona has the secretarygeneral the the council the mr solana that out that our neighbours the first priority the the external action the the union are our closest neighbours are the mediterranean countries
we know but already to good that the source the any conflicts if result the demographic growth income  cultural differences the the medium term also in this countries is
our attention must than also in the first place from to to to the achieve the peace and safety in the mediterranean region we must already the possible do the promotion the the cooperation with the mediterranean countries and a effective application the the appropriations the the european union not without interests has committed
from interests must we generous the relation the the mediterranean region are we must because the by the european citizens the european society as urgent desired stability in the region to guarantee
mr the president beginning september have we the meda presented the on which we although a number shortcomings have can see but that also and especially the is been to loud and clear the euromediterranean ambitions the our sitting and the the commission from to speak
mr patten i i the article the your hand in le through the today read and i endorse the fully
i i heard what minister moscovici just has said the is fully line with what you itself has written
and what we here with a very large majority have adopted vote for with hardly vote against shows the that we the there all completely on agree are that this euromediterranean process renewed and enriched must to be
the the eve the the conference the marseilles would i a number points to the want to to there certainly the to are that we in this issues a answer will to the has because little sense still what to continue repeat which we the however already with other agree are
specific steps are need and precise answers must we to
moreover i i thursday a and another still discussion with the mr  the french minister the with this issues responsible is and i i understand that the french presidency there the full that agrees to the process a new impetus to give the the way the we stand
in the first place would i few words want turn the the budget
how the the the
there is about on a amount the roughly billion euro for the period but that amount seems quite to varies
what is now exactly the budget for
there is least billion euro per year need but that amount is far not granted further is there there the a amount the million euro that transferred would must be from a flexible postal the the has the the appropriations for kosovo and serbia
very clear is the all not
the is here not to the question what the this needs the most is the is to the question how we new resources can find
i am the fully with commissioner patten agree when he the that specific actions only the correct way taken can be if for the actions also actually appropriations are granted
i i a urgent appeal the already our mr programmes to a estimate to make the the necessary appropriations so we indeed to action can move and the dossiers in treatment can take
in the second place would i want say that the decentralised cooperation new life dialogue must to be because the is there properly bad the to
this is a important point the concern for the local communities and for the nongovernmental organisations as the  the november in marseilles but already to clear has made
also must the financial framework the for the the regional cooperation mandate be so crosssector between the region programmes can the and regional trade to the the can be the would also opportunities created can be for environmental fight the terrorism and drug emigration integration and the by us discrepancy progress the the area the the human
we questions what measures the commission the plan is to take to projects with participation the the social civil the the on to to and to more grip to to the the treatment and the followup the the dossiers
that are the important specific questions the i here the the item wanted to i thank the mr brok for the fact that he this debate possible has made precisely before the presidency and the commission in debate will act on this issues
the fr mr the president mr the commissioner i join i the the the here concerns wish as quickly possible the euromediterranean partnership again the the to to
the those itself to the also already the the process the barcelona is deadlock the as is the formulated the presented is what this the very what less far than the expressed ambitions
the peoples in the south are often quite critical and make the ensure on the failure the this process
i part their feelings the impatience and even disappointment and anger the not only to make have with the slow which the affairs regulated be but also caused be by the shortcomings the this partnership and the harmful consequences that the now for the first the the light act
in the very unequal relations between the both  the the mediterranean sea is not change has which the peoples in the south still still in a extremely critical economic and social situation situation the dominated the by poverty and unemployment with particularly under young
the way to the area the shared prosperity has therefore far not more has than a number agreements the only based are the interests the economic and financial nature and which with the needs the the population completely not account the taken
however being the population already the consequences the the debt the fall the the  and the imposed structural adjustments
the trade would this lack the balance the agree considerably can increase while the this at precisely urgent need there the more cooperation to the the needs to meet
the think i with particularly the the public services and more in the particularly the affairs if water education health public transport and housing
this partnership has only future if the close cooperation includes with the representatives the the involved citizens and their organisations the ngos programmes the unions and all other association
further must the wish the peace the both sides the the mediterranean sea heard and as quickly possible fulfilled to be
the ensnare the violence in the east and the war the israel with unprecedented stridency and determination the against the palestinian people that still still the right the a the denied the forms a threat for the future the the whole region
there is a emphatically request the the palestinian leaders the table which the european union called the without only reserve in to intervene to the arms the silent the to to a sensible dialogue the the to to and the active in to to for implementation the the resolutions
the conference the marseilles had to a the can give
the failure the now yes in certain sense failure the the the charter the peace and stability late see that the safety the europe not achieved can be by the south sidelined to to and the borders to the
i i the last days in marseilles can the that there the different sides vote direction to a call to do the the ministerial conference to the debt say to cancel the trade to replace by relations the based are the cooperation and solidarity
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president the issue programmes the the euromediterranean dialogue must to my opinion from social political and cultural view be as in the spirit the the process the the euromediterranean conference that in november in barcelona is started when there for the first is about on a euromediterranean policy despite the difficulties because the complex nature the the subject
the world pact the the a as gradually irreversible globalisation in that framework must we us in large blocs organise the if  that can do in the large  the the global competition
the the the europe the the national states encouraged to the in a political economic and commercial block to unite a market the more than million consumers to create and the to link with other markets
this must suitable structures be created the same political and economic can are
to to start are however political strategies need the the bureaucracy not area or time let
europe is  the large values peace freedom social progress values the still any day defended must be precisely because they the fruit are the acquis the so sacrifices have called
the economic growth the europe the the discussion the by the globalisation that the the at way is the risk is large that us continent by the challenges the the crises countries the where the costs the work but a tenth are the the in europe the the usa and the japan in a recession ends
the policy the now the by a heterogeneous the different interests and perhaps a opportunity the stabilisation and must therefore different aspects include development the initiatives for the maintain the the peace but not only that according i the up the disregarded where north and southern the involved are precisely because the mediterranean not area for dialogue tolerance cooperation and guarantee for peace and stability can be without a strong political like sustainable and balanced social and economic development the less prosperous peoples and social development the the  so the employment improves
we are there therefore the convinced that the policy the the union account must the with its origin the in the mediterranean is they must ensure ensure that the mediterranean a project the without to forget that the rights the a people before the the individual people to already was the but because conflicts between countries end the life and the development the individual citizens among
the aggravates  the  the  cultures the the words the the mediterranean sea the years hostile the other have been have now the opportunity a common way to choose the with through the the dialogue and political like real opportunities for economic and social growth will that
mr the president as the european union in nice the balance between deepening and enlargement must find must they in marseilles the balance between its task in central and its responsibility in the mediterranean find there must priorities be the
europe must by the enlargement the from be built and in europe and the western balkans must a  the the be the the barcelona that since five year  must the not be neglected
we can hypothetical observations the on the question or the european union the balkans with a decisive and coherent all had can prevent and the the the way the consequences the the war had can save
the the eve the marseilles is the there however to ensure to ensure that the support for the balkans not the expense the the meda is or versa that must also within the in berlin agreed financial framework done
under the conditions must the possible are the the special council the marseilles to a agreement to to the not again only the above in the european union visible makes
the  programmes should also the the on the the commission certainly not by bureaucratic obstacles be delayed in the future must also the involved mediterranean countries more projects supply
that the mediterranean countries the the billion euro from the in last meda entail scarcely a fourth have included is disappointing
the that however also that the ability the the countries the the mediterranean sea to appropriations the to take realistic must be assessed
i welcome in that the the plan the the commission to the agreement to up the revision the the regulation think i very positive
i i in my speech to now to aware avoid the the to to between the  and the conflict in the near east
that the meeting place that israel and the palestinians want participate and the boycott by the arab league apparently not more than a threat was is the itself already a success
we hope that this conference in marseilles not platform for polemics the and that the mediterranean policy the the european union and the barcelona this a strong incentive will to
the es mr the president if tomorrow and day all countries the the statement the barcelona have signed the the euromediterranean conference in marseilles present are is that a large compliment for ourselves
a such success would demonstrate that the process the barcelona which in the spirit the the oslo a beginning is made sufficient is  and present to not by the  process in the near east to be affected
if the process the barcelona simply continues would we even already is the too a very considerable contribution can make the the resumption the the dialogue in the near east
however the the different uncoordinated the these days the opportunity the the  there the the process the barcelona be drawn is especially to the that only already the fact that the process simply continues and that there ministerial meetings are been with representatives the israel the palestinian authority syria lebanon etc us to satisfaction must vote
that is perhaps a voting comfort
the the balance the now the drawn see we however the that the strategic development the the euromediterranean policy course not must depend the the situation the a the at
the time will us learn what the results are positive results will end be measured to the extent the development the the southern countries in the mediterranean region
for the countries is the extremely difficult to the the level the the globalisation a certain extent the development and economic integration to achieve we must already the possible to do to ensure to ensure that there again balance is in a situation the now characterised the by a enormous distance between north and south
if the current trend the continue is there little reason to optimism for the future
today the day is a european statistical given twelve time as rich if someone from the  if we the reverse not know to times will he on ten year twenty time as rich are
therefore welcome we the proposal to a new impetus the the process the barcelona to give we are the fully agree with the two priorities the the mr patten in are speeches has indicated and the here afternoon still agree are mentioned
the procedures with the to the agreements must be now
with particularly must prevent to be that we on five year the the made the the balance with the to the use the the programmed must conclude that only of is used
that is however not sufficient i i must we also becomes for the medium term make
i think in this the especially the three issues the first a number european projects the form can give the a regional area in the southern countries the second a humane policy for the manage the with particularly flows the third fundamental and the seek to consensus with the to the development the a common agricultural in the mediterranean countries
without that policy will we the medium term probably not positive results make
mr the president the process the barcelona again shipping and direction give like say the not only deal with the free market with economic and trade but means also a new policy for cooperation development and protection the the human in the whole area up the means the necessary social reforms launch which the problem the the employment central the just if the need to the economy the the south again the the to to and to the debt to alleviate and say to cancel the means a economic cultural and political exchange the the to not only with the countries in the north but also between the southern countries between the means a greater role play in the civil
the has not sense to deny that the process the barcelona the in a critical stage is not only because the impetus there or because the european union less attention has for the mediterranean because the problems the the balkans or the enlargement the the union but also because the dramatic conflict in the area the the  advise
the palestinian issue the again in the centre
commissioner patten says that we not the hostages should be the the conflict between israel and palestine
that is where but we can there not choice
if we not as quickly possible the problem the the recognition the a palestinian the solve a the the addition israel can there if we not end make the the occupation the the western west and the gaza can the problem not be resolved
that is in the first place need to a end to make the the suffering the the palestinian people but also to the region stable to make
i hope that the conference the ministers the the union in marseilles a position will adopt that with the the still again in  very repeated statement that the human not violated should be
a new start is certainly necessary but we must the aware that we not to the central issue the the mediterranean across can
mr the president the the eve the the conference the marseilles can we see that there since the conference the barcelona indeed the a and another in the mediterranean region is happened
the is where that the next conference the taken in a context the violence and  if result the the conflict in the east the is however also where that this meeting the inflaming the the euromediterranean process consistently the and that the process not blocked if result the the dramatic conflict
the euromediterranean countries have a large number problems common illegal immigration poverty foreign debt human drought and terrorism which the life the innocent people and families in example spain algeria or the near east merciless the destroyed
more than ever must we now to have that only a regional cooperation a dialogue with the social civil economic and cultural exchanges solidarity and between understanding both words the the mediterranean sea longdistance can forging to a prosperous men region
the commission and the council must with the the urgency the agreements the feira the implement to to they must a common policy for the development the the mediterranean region up
we can and should us potential the people imminent industrial or small resources not sources let together with the primary products oil gas or new technologies forms they the  for the development the a mediterranean society the many balanced fairer and more competitive is than the current
mr the president back to the conflict in the near east still not two months ago have the president the the israeli parliament and the the the palestinian legislative council here hands were with the president the the european parliament in a call to peace and agreement
from the european parliament have we that gesture united with a  applause welcome if arms the place adopt the words dialogue and understanding than is there something wrong with the basis and essence the the democracy
than time the parliament and than failure we the european union must the many more the to to in the mediterranean region
the is a region the us european continent in historic and cultural respect enormous has enriched and increase the would a from mistake are if we now not what do what the history the us calls
hand am i also the opinion mr the commissioner that the geopolitical borders are intended to the free movement to deny the those the the the organised crime the trade in arms drugs or people and very in the particularly the the terrorism a way the life make the by all civilised countries the condemned
let we there with other for ensure that crime and criminals the the borders be  and that there not obstacle the raised for the development culture or aspiration the the peoples
the european union has need the a new  and a better control the the flows
they is together with the countries the origin responsible for the immigration the planning the the for the development the the region as necessary flows
the fr mr the president gentlemen mr programmes any day the board the in the sign the the current crisis in the east and any day the board shows us as that still need is that everything what the happening in the south the in the mediterranean the us directly affects and even us daily life may
when the good is with the south is there peace possible be there progress made the the area the the democratisation see we signs the economic development and the the uncontrolled emigration the
short the situation is than hope
but is the bad with the south than have we to make with wars violence and fundamentalism the also here the us in our supersede the and than late i the risk the a new crisis still but outside one
today the day must we again the the worst prepared are the pictures the television let on not doubt there
the this facts the by a number the our mr programmes since year and day constantly out
unfortunately are the southern countries by the enlargement the europe to the east and the crises and wars in the balkans since few years more and more from the mind the the most europeans disappeared if result of are there many delays in in the mediterranean programme programmes and policies
we see that the appropriations reduced be and especially that the still difficult the the appropriations in to to
the general negotiations are the negotiations on agreements are delay the and statute late at long the the wait
this lead to feelings the large disappointment the our partners in the south the political importance the europe the than also piling the while we despite everything still still the most source are the the southern countries
the now the the must we than also the several members have the afternoon already said the our political objectives shifting to the south the established appropriations confirm the the the agreements with the partner up and the charter for peace and stability again a central place give further must we us make to the partner the their development to support the debt the the poorest countries to reduce and our markets open to to for the products the this countries
finally must we on to to to harmonisation the our asylum and  for people the the in europe want draw
short the must there again the can confidence that europe actually objective to a where partnership with the south
everyone is the of aware and this is not only a quantitative but also and especially a qualitative effort need
both the commission if the council assure us towards to to
we want they like believe but the countries in the south have the what otherwise need than vague promises or fine keep and we must ensure ensure that they that also to
marseilles offers this probably the last opportunity
this conference is than also a the the large challenges for the french presidency
the fr mr the president the summit the marseilles must a step forward mean the the way to introduction the a trade a type internal market which following the the wto help the as you as good writing in le through the today mr patten
the emphasis is fully the the economic pillar
again seeks the european union the as during the asem  in seoul a month ago the its economic model and its capital to export
in marseilles were the a other summit however also staff the unions and political organisations from from the whole mediterranean meet determined throws this people joint to resources to to for in the needs the the inhabitants the their country
i i can a solution only found be by new roads in to we that like say by the debt the this countries say to cancel
very what more however is the fact that the this at while we here in this chamber in all upon our sometimes strong different positions the the exchange are palestinians killed be in still greater numbers
the european union must as quickly possible the because this is really a emergency the to to with a statement which the israeli aggression towards the palestinian people deserve condemned the the palestinians demands the completely legitimate grounds the right the to peaceful to can life in a own the and the the demand must as quickly possible result to be given
the es mr the president europe is sometimes the very opinions someone with almost is quite agree inclined something on the head to see
i note that in already this reports on the strengthening the the agreement the barcelona few things on the head be given
a the the things is that there the the liberalisation the internal market nothing ends if important aspects if people culture or education not attention to
if we the markets liberalisation and admit the the impetus to the markets expense what costs to into are we the risk that we end not cooperation but colonisation have individual
europe must the subsidiarity perhaps somewhat all and good aware that for increase the the level the the recipient countries considerable support need is the support is intended for men and women for education but also for a minimum level that in europe for all citizens course is
we can than also not only on products and organisation talk also the citizens must the necessary attention to to
in the second place think i that we also still a another important subject on the head see namely the environment
europe has not policy developed the the area the desertification or  in the mediterranean countries we must think the the develop the a mediterranean environmental which account the taken with the location the natural approach and the climatic diversity the the mediterranean region
the policy that today the the item is been can in many countries in the south the the mediterranean region not be applied
we must also the fact under view see that if result the the tourism in europe citizens from the north a enormous pressure to the the south the the mediterranean region
if result the the barrels the raw oil will there still more pressure the the mediterranean region to
that result in space and a completely unacceptable environmental
we should not the the european citizens expect that they aware with the environment deal while we meantime the environmental in other countries the our flout committing
to decision the the debate i i a resolution accordance article member the the rules received
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow wednesday to at place
aid for reconstruction
the the item is the joint debate on the next reports
a the the mr lagendijk behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the amended proposal for a regulation the the council on the european bureau for reconstruction com c cns
a the the mr westendorp y cabeza behalf the commission industry external trade research and energy on the amended proposal for a regulation the the council on the assistance the albania bosnia and through croatia the federal republic yugoslavia and the former yugoslav republic macedonia and to amendment the regulation eec no decision ec and regulation eec no com c cns
president commissioner the has just took before the commission with a  was for the aid the the western balkans
there was as know in may already a proposal but we have to september must wait until there a final proposal was
that had everything to make with the discussion the in the commission held is on a other way for the to the foreign aid
with other words the proposal that there now is reflect the discussion and is also according i a first example the how the in the future would must
that means also that the the wait worth was the the new proposal the the commission because that proposal both for what the the overall regulation on the balkans if the proposal for the agency in kosovo clear and clear the how the european commission in the future think its aid to to
perhaps to the a little  to say is the also the a type new beginning the the aid based the the extremely bad experience in bosnia but also based the the good experience in kosovo
there is now a regulation the in my view the european union in the the to the a efficient way and the time aid to to and  the a good way to to in the countries the the western balkans
the and that is very important i come this will still the back is a good balance found between the responsibility the the commission one and the need to the member there the a or other way the to involve hand
a balance the in my opinion and i think also in the vision the the commission in the past the agree find was which the member many and many to many did a finger in the responsibility to to the the aid
the proposals the there now are this is the balance many better in
course and than come i the the reports the myself and the the mr westendorp are there improvements possible
everyone the the proposed reports see and read will see that there a number improvements the parts be proposed
example explicit attention for the construction the the civil society explicit attention for the support the media explicit attention for the important role the the education
i was chance previous week the a conference in zagreb and than that agree to more how important the is that future generations the will i but say small  not preparing be with the old accusers and  and that there also the that area a renewal place
i think the important that in this regulation the down that the european commission also in the future as now for that type projects money the
i like there however two political main from to
the first the and the sorry i that i the commissioner this again difficult that must the the finance
to the but very state to say if we today and tomorrow the succeed to a good opinion to give on this regulation than have we one part the us work done i would the mention the first half
than the the paper how the in the future would must
if we this in december however not the resources add to the regulation from to to than are we today are with a debate on a emptyhanded hollow
that is not accusation the the commission
the commission has can see that i explicitly to call to the assessment the the costs the the commission made has the famous billion euro for the next seven year explicitly the to take in this regulation because we otherwise to the but state to say hypocritical are are
we can here not in the parliament a regulation the meddling that the resources the ensure need are to the from to to there not will are
hence that this part one is in the work for a good aid the the balkans
part two is in december if our colleagues the the committee but end the whole parliament will must choose for a down financial justification the this regulation
in the sense is the unfortunately that the mr moscovici the this at not here is because i see with particularly a responsibility the that point are for the council for the member the prepared must are to recognise that what they want and we want with this regulation money costs and that that money found would must be in the budget the the european union
the second point the general point on the aid is the balance the there found would must be hence a amendment the that point between the the one on the need the visibility the the european union the the balkans and the the other on the need to also smaller projects to support
the is now once as and everyone the the the balkans been is can that confirm that the united states there extremely good in are the impression to give that they with many less money in the are many more to do
that the european union in fact many more money paying but many less visible is has the many people to the conclusion led that the need is to the the balkans many profile present to are
with the assessment am i the agree
that means almost automatically that there many money will to to the large projects to the roads to the bridges to the projects which you a european flag the can to
again that is need to the visibility to increase
but that is my warning the must there not to lead that the the ranking all smaller projects the we to now to also supported have the victims would be
hence my call to within this regulation a good balance to find between visibility that like say large projects the the one on and the the other on permanent attention for  for projects the to make have with safety projects the often not as visible are but the more to need are to stability the the balkans to guarantee
than the agency in kosovo
in a positive  think i the agree and hope i the agree that the agency as the to now to successful has and the the way which the in the future would function a example would must are the how the the would must with the aid the the balkans but also in other parts the the world
my experience after different visits the the agency are as positive because this in my view with all again with all mistakes the this also made be the clear the a new good way aid the granted
if we the than have on strengthening the the effectiveness the general objective the this regulation if we than that involve the the agency in kosovo than can strengthening the the effectiveness nothing otherwise mean than the reduce the the role the the member
very specific the reduce the the council the administration the linked is the the agency
there is in the past also by us many criticism expressed the the way which the european commission aid its that is often to bureaucratic
the is often through to complex procedures but we must our view not the and also not want the and i hope that the member that also not do for the role the they the played have
many to often have the member tried a finger in the responsibility to to the the to the aid
many to often has that led to delay to inefficiency and to the defend the national interests
what i the and that is a the the central messages in my report on the agency will the member in the future less often and less long their finger in the responsibility to because proven is that the aid this the delayed
finally president and commissioner a last point
there there the a number the my colleagues the tendency to the work the the agency still further from to want extend than to now to already decided is
the agency is now in kosovo and the council has decided what i the rightly to that from to extend to serbia and montenegro
i think that we the that at also will must put because from the work that the agency now does physical reconstruction a lesson learnt can be to same the a good way to do in serbia and montenegro
aid the the balkans in the framework the cards in countries if croatia albania and macedonia requires other details requires other capabilities
i would than also want say late the agency do where the good in is and that is physical reconstruction
the will very difficult are to that the same good way to do in serbia
let we us this to and us not  in the enlargement the the capabilities the the agency outside the borders the the former yugoslavia
the es mr the president mr the commissioner i am i that aware that the balkans not the to optimism the give
however think i not to optimistic to are if i say that the european union the this at the results acceding the a coordinated continuing action
after the tragedy that the the the balkans has place were there few months ago in croatia than however free elections and is the in that country prepared the human to respect in belgrade have the citizens confirmed that they in peace and freedom with other want life and that they to the european family want join
we must their expectations not  more than ever have already the countries now our assistance need
we must the region the to are in that stabilisation the countries must be  for a perspective the the longer term which they end part can of the the european institutions
the to we our credibility and our own stability course the the stake if we them however want help will that the a more efficient and coherent way than to far must to done
as the mr lagendijk has said must the european assistance especially also visible to are the european union the the most money the the balkans from but is many less visible than example the united states
the united states can almost immediately respond the any need the the but leeway that is even far that i when i during my residence in bosniaherzegovina a visit the a village was to enthusiasm by the population was received with the right wonderful what the americans all for us do
the action the the european union had therefore all visibility lost
my report on the assistance the the countries the the western balkans is to the has in close cooperation with the mr lagendijk our respective committees the the also exemplary have worked the have the regard the the two issues the now the the item are a number restrictions noted
one are there geographical restrictions that the in that the action the the bureau for reconstruction not only to kosovo but also to yugoslavia must be extended
also are we with few functional restrictions faced
also the international organisations the the operations out example unmik in kosovo or the bureau the the high representative in sarajevo have our assistance need
other actions in the framework the the cards concern not much the reconstruction the the country but serve the from to education and training short the reconstruction the the civil society this actions find in close cooperation with the ngos place
the is the the the important that the ngos the this point with other work and their work coordinate only than will their action the efficiency win and all parts the the regions can achieve
also the important the the media must to be recognised
the media in this region are often responsible been for the tragedy that the this has place the media must completely independent are and act in agreement with the in our democracies current rules
also is the the the the important that there in the region a really independent justice is
there is also there the few functional restrictions this are also the cause the the lack the visibility
the are restrictions the to make have with the way which the assistance the managed
the the to the the assistance the sometimes to bureaucratic or to  in
what the the cards is the therefore the important that the management the to the large lines the the guarantees limited the is not the intention that there the day to day a these  the held because than to we again with same problems if in the past to camps
the important is also that the work the the  and that the the bureau for reconstruction in kosovo not by other are prevent must be that work duplication be done or other there
also must the role the the european parliament to be strengthened with the amendments which we probably tomorrow will vote can the european parliament a greater consultation role in the process the interinstitutional cooperation allocated to
to finally still a comment on the financial package
we know but already to good that the miracle the the  and the fish the today the day not will repeat with the few resources the us now the available are is the practical impossible to the all external obligations the the european union to meet
we must the efficiency the our assistance increase and this better coordinate question parts must so possible brought to be
finally repeat i the words the the commission that this two proposals the cornerstone forms the a process that there end to must lead that this countries the already with so problems are faced fully part to of the the european structures
i am there the the convinced that there for the balkans a solution is and that the evil the the balkans can be us this have they however already our aid the need
mr the president i think that president westendorp the content the this important measure doing and adequate has described
we if commission culture the commission which i the honour i president to are have in our contribution us opinion the emphasis the the the important opportunities the the reconstruction in the balkans offers to this area in europe if whole to into same have we amendments proposed the the the opinion a cultural dimension and a cultural importance give not in disappointing or general terms but in terms the solidarity
this amendments are in the commission industry good received i believe that they contribute the the economic civil and  the the reconstruction by areas the as been affected are again a civil life to offer but they offer also the possibility the cultural and institutional with emphasis institutional solidarity so the areas the with europe linked feel also the the level the the civilisation the cultural initiatives
that this amendments opinions the the commission culture are adopted and there a unanimously position to the is has is to my opinion a important given i hope that the parliament there attention the will to and the will take in are assessment
president gentlemen colleagues mr the commissioner for you the here a fortunately man a fortunately man if rapporteur for opinion because the majority part the the amendments the the commission control by the commission the committee are adopted
this can we therefore only but welcome to are
us work has any result has
but i am also a fortunately man because i believe that the parliament by course pressure the managed is a situation the originally not as good was the good to times
rapporteur lagendijk has there rightly the out that the the original proposal the the commission fact not learn is drawn from the past not learn from the comments the the court already made had not learn from the experience the the european bureau for reconstruction not learn from the comments the we last year already could read in the report the mrs pack not learn from the results the the hoc considered the we to kosovo had sent and the under leadership the doris pack and  wynn very important recommendations has formulated
when i my report in july  had i immediately by that this original proposal not good was
i i when the commission asked the proposal back to draw
i am welcome that they this has done and with a new proposal is has
since october is for us a new proposal a proposal which we now work
i think that we this thanks the pressure the this parliament welcome to should are
where is the to
we must that ensure that with the for us present regulations the taken that the by the european union  aid in the western balkans the a rapid flexible and  way the ground the the in cooperation with the population and the authorities the ground
that is not enough happened in the over years
we have this a flexible means need a light structure a not bureaucratic structure
the is unfortunately that the presidentinoffice here not present is
the is especially the council the are especially the member the the the over years if the were if  have behave in a large machinery
they have impossible made what possible had can are
i am therefore welcome with the for us present proposal
behalf the commission control can i you say that we all amendments support
we are course also very welcome that the amendment on olaf is adopted
the is indeed as that also the  the full its work in the western balkans must can do
finally still a small comment more from personal name than from name the the commission control
i am the this at are with a report on the spending the the financial resources in bosniaherzegovina
a  the a special report the the court
colleagues in the  will we that must ensure that there sufficient money for bosniaherzegovina the allocated
the task is this not the there is this still a long way to to
the is a fragile and continual the
let we that especially good in the view the in the future
the sorry i that we the debate with the groups must start in absence the the presidentinoffice president the the council
they have i however assured that he here each at can are
the the mr the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen the the fact hand with other linked reports the the gentlemen  and westendorp on the bureau and the cards support the the experience the we with the previous obnova and the bureau for kosovo have gained
we know all that we only with  and more structures the good work the the bureau for kosovo the the last months can continue
we must there in the future for ensure that only the director the responsibility bears the the body that the programme programmes 
only if we the number responsible people to gaining the work the europe the ground the visibility
in bosnia is the the americans still again managed with very limited financial resources however the the come to act
the many places where we the most money have given and that still still do is our visibility limited the money disappears and the even not the one few institution allocated
also the double work the the   and management  and the unnecessary  meetings the their members while the responsible director however time necessary decisions must take must be avoid
i hope that commission and council the proposals the the parliament will accept
unnecessary expenditure for unnecessary meetings must really be avoid
the ground is the money more need the can better this be used
if the council now last from are mistakes would learn the what he the my report on the bureau for kosovo not has done would that course also the taxpayers the good to
the objectives the the cards were fact good
in that cards subjects however a very important objective the support the education and training in the countries
without education and training is there nothing the am i than also very that the members the all committees i have help to this amendment in to must
i i understand that also the commissioner take that this a important objective the the cards must are
also the council must that however find
i hope that the french minister the education the mr long ensure can ensure that the french government the the the next meeting the the committee the permanent representatives not against the inclusion the the  in the cards opposition that would counterproductive are
i am that convinced that the mr long everything will do what possible is if the mr moscovici this would are would he that perhaps also do
i thank therefore all mr programmes the the important the this objective have recognised the am i that we in the future also the this area more content the the countries can offer
president i wanted today a number general comments make on what i would want mention the political reconstruction the the stabilising
the mr swoboda will behalf my group what more say on what i would want mention the reconstruction the the eu  as the today also the the item is the the hand the the reports the the gentlemen lagendijk and westendorp which my congratulate
the the are the developments in the balkans the the last year if positive to country
in a year is there many progress made and the internal dynamic in a number countries strengthened last the role the the international community that while the kosovo still fresh in us memory is
kosovo is and remains the tread
the result the the local elections was positive
that is he course always when  win but the internal situation remains odds witness also the recent murder the four roma the if refugees from belgium were returned to kosovo
course prevails the question what is the future the kosovo within yugoslavia
we the pse are against fantasies on a independent kosovo
we wait therefore with tension the first meeting between president kostunica and the mr rugova the
perhaps can the european union the still a intermediary role play
we must us however not only the kosovo sharply
there are especially also positive developments
i would they if a although slow return to the normal want probably
the last year was the in the sign the the nowadays the the real democracy and the politicians the refuse exclusive nationalism if political vehicle to use
they were and to in the place the three politicians the the is the bad on the the former yugoslavia the the years s represented
i i the than on tudjman milosevic and 
in zagreb is a government the with us  on the future the the region the actually investment in democracy and stability
tomorrow received we in this house the new president the yugoslavia
they are what i the the new wideboy the the balkans and they are course also more than welcome
croatia must now quickly are links with the european union can strengthen
addition slovenia is the according i the first country the the former yugoslavia that the term in eligible is for eu
serbia deserves the this at especially material support as quickly possible
europe must clear show that are support a difference part already before the elections in serbia
the do is this week what i the however to the leader the the social in bosnia and between only to the population the slovakia the not  in the  the the opposition for the government had up but that is a another chapter
in some reports on the elections in bosnia read i that the  have won the the elections in 
that seems the the first face as to are especially in the   and in the croatian part
in the rugova part the for the first the position the the nationalists the
this start in any case the changes in croatia and serbia a influence to to
the social have the this remarkably good done
that is in europe and even in the balkans not as particularly but what the remarkably mentioned must be is that this party multiethnic is and this openly from and associate
the recent meetings in sarajevo established the leader the this party   in were the serbs croats montenegro  and other representatives from the region the concept the the reconstruction the the spirit the he he the the core
we must especially invest in the physical reconstruction the the former yugoslavia but the has only sense if there also something change in the heads the the people
politicians the the this openly working deserve not only our admiration but especially also our support
they are the only the the nationalist  can down
the stability the the region will depend the the extent which new leaders the national spirit in the bottle can the and a other mentality can develop
their political fate will also depend the the success the the aid the the european union
the reports the the colleagues westendorp and lagendijk contain the building for a efficient approach of
the da mr the president the liberal group supports the reports which we now a debate the and we support the attempts the the commission to the difficult actions the the union in the balkans within more to let has
the aid was to still to to bureaucratic and to slowly because the management in the commission to  and the a to high level happening
the into the too in details and the parliament is here in certain extent responsible for
the into the the bureau in a headquarters in  and a operational centre in pristina was a unfortunate decision itself we us still opposition have
now has also the court the this decision criticism expressed
the is positive that in the budget the this year million euro for kosovo and million euro for emergency the serbia are included
the is however very unfortunately that the resources for the  in kosovo for the baltic region and the rapid  if reserve are built
the is wrong that we not security have on the available resources for serbia next year
the is especially unfortunately because the serbian democratic elected president tomorrow here is
the is also wrong that a whole series programmes in the socalled treaty reserve  is together
i know that the parliament the commission the like force the better to behave but the is wrong are own children to ransom
we would the commission better free stake give so they its work more can out and if this not manage than must we us the right reserved the commission to criticise
we should us not complicity make the the disadvantage the by us desired programmes
late us the commission more resources give and the possibility offer its tasks to delegate so the easier the rapid decisions to take and as need the direction to change
late us the visit the the serbian president tomorrow celebrating by the commission the opportunity to give our aid the a new and better rail to to
the el mr the president the before financial forms a the the many mechanisms for foreign interference in this extremely sensitive area the europe
the international imperialism know but already to good how the the tactics the the classification and the root must apply how the  with humanitarian aid and property with reconstruction must 
the final objective is the people the the peoples the the new item
i question i the how precisely those the so damage have caused now on reconstruction dare to speak
where to the who the small children and defenceless citizens the  courage from to their victims lesson in democracy rule and human to give
what the imperialist forces yugoslavia owe are are not humanitarian asylum but loan
behind the events the few weeks ago in yugoslavia behind the socalled uprising is the least hundred million dollar find the was paid the support the the socalled democratic opposition
the can best are that by this events a climate the euphoria is the in the changes circles the the imperialism itself know this however but already to good that the the opposition the the yugoslav people and the other peoples not is down
therefore to they also mobile military units and police the the mislead
fr mr the commissioner gentlemen members we are us there all the aware that the western balkans a important challenge is for the european union and for the credibility the its foreign political that is both by the extent the our commitment in the region in human political and money if by our wish there a stable region the to make by the balkans the to build to develop and end again the to take in the european family
this year is positive started with the democratic revolution in croatia the result the the produced and presidential
then was there a other important event place the victory the the democratic forces in the federal republic yugoslavia and the fall the 
we hope that the year end with a strengthening the the democracy the the elections in serbia the december next
as you know has the european union the affect used to its contribution to make the this historic changes
the union has immediately responded the the new situation in croatia by the process in the to to that the november during the summit the zagreb will lead to the opening the negotiations on a stabilisation and agreement with that country
with the promise the the serbian population has the union directly after the election the president kostunica the you tomorrow will received the necessary measures affected lifting the the sanctions against the federal republic yugoslavia million euro emergency as decided by the european council in biarritz and integration the the federal republic yugoslavia in the international community order the strengthening the the process to support
i would like still what more back the the priorities the the presidency the costeffectiveness the the western balkans
with the view the the summit the zagreb has the union the aware concentrated the the strengthening the the democracy and the the deepening the the stabilisation and process
as to we a double objective after the first the development the the regional cooperation and the second the implementation the a effective political the rapprochement between this countries and the european union
in cologne had the european council their the membership the the union in the prospect the
in feira are the countries the part the the stabilisation and process if potential candidates for accession regarded
we want this supply confirm the the summit the zagreb but also further to we want namely for each country set what obstacles there the the way to the membership still taken must be and what reforms still must be carried
finally want we from the union a strong support develop to this countries in that process to hand
the proposal the france will the the summit the zagreb for the first all state and government the other to the the european union and the the countries the participate the the stabilisation and process albania bosniaherzegovina croatia the former yugoslav republic macedonia and the federal republic yugoslavia
the this summit will we therefore the the highest level the consequences can draw from the decisive democratic so in the region and  still agree the that the way now for all countries in the region open is for rapprochement to the union in the framework the the stabilisation and process
that we intends are this process so possible to use may will from the fact that we in zagreb the negotiations on the first stabilisation and agreement with the former yugoslav republic macedonia will finish or that we still take the a the the situation the each country appropriate approach and we as i i said the perspectives for all precise in card to
the summit has still other objectives the strengthen the the democracy in the federal republic yugoslavia the support the the believes between that country and the neighbouring and the encourage the cooperation the  between the countries in the region
therefore will the union that point that they the the five on countries expect that they already from now agreements for regional cooperation conclude without to wait to the stabilisation and agreements in force act
this agreements for regional cooperation the within the stabilisation and agreements and must according us the next points cover the up the a political dialogue a regional trade and a close cooperation the the area the justice and home affairs in the particularly to with through the a strong independent justice apparatus effective the to can act against the organised crime the corruption the laundering the money and any other form the crime
the rapprochement to the european union is indeed in the view the the council the inseparable linked with the development the the regional cooperation
the treatment the the  and  on the proposals for regulations the first for the framework and the second for the european bureau for reconstruction the us the opportunity still agree back to to the the large extent the the support the the union the the western balkans like to give order the stabilisation and process to hand
this two reports to in the good direction
the  shares your concern that the framework the principles the the reform the the management the the aid the countries outside the union in practice must to less procedures more coordination the ground less behind the commitments obligations
also want we that the sphere the the european bureau for reconstruction that are encourage in kosovo has earned the extended to the whole federal republic yugoslavia
we want that the bureau the programmes the the by the commission the life more effect
the  the the the objective agreement to achieve on the proposals for the regulations on the  and the bureau for reconstruction in the council general affairs the end november next week therefore so we this the november in zagreb know can make
i repeat the most priorities the the  institutional strengthening with if objective a democratic rule economic development and regional cooperation
thanks cards must the programme the the union in the region more cohesion to and more and more be
in the council budget the july on were the member the there unanimously on agree that the the discussions on the total allocation for cards for the period the the amount the category the the the the european council the berlin the financial perspectives in eight had be taken
the amount including also assistance the the federal  yugoslavia will the is the result the a global decision on the distribution the the within category available billion euro on the two  programmes meda ii and cards
finally has the council general affairs the september the initiative the the presidency unilateral trade approved the favour the the countries the the the stabilisation and process participate
by this measures enjoy agriculture and industrial products from the countries a treatment the imports in the community market
the has the union a an gesture made agricultural in the particularly can almost unlimited and free the duties be every
the council working now the enlargement the this measures to the federal republic yugoslavia
the french presidency had the ambitious objectives the with the to the western balkans we are now the the point the objectives to achieve
i mention the remarkable community measures the development the the stabilisation and process the the the the  and the adoption the the trade
the long victory the the democratic forces in croatia and the federal republic yugoslavia act the european union course many further to to therefore must we the the summit the zagreb a strong political message give a message the up the the hope the peace and reconciliation the the countries in the region in the democratic revolution have located
the is the the european union to the countries to say yes your place and your future are within the european family
mr the president my first impression the president kostunica is that he in are political activities very pragmatic to work is has since he in the federal republic yugoslavia the the power was
he has are victory consolidated but is also describe been in are relations with other leaders in the region
he has already a visit the the sarajevo he has a informal regional meeting in opinion attended and he has moscow visited
the european union has completely rightly positive responded the the adoption the the power by president kostunica
the  are now and the  and the  are now lifted
the fact that the commission for million euro the the by the ngos to to the emergency and assistance has committed is laudable
i hope that president kostunica and the people to him across their position if new democratic leaders the the federal republic yugoslavia the all political levels steadily further will consolidate
the elections for the serbian parliament are planned for december
i welcome the to that president kostunica the important the cooperation with the tribunal for war in den hague presented
president kostunica is if the new president the yugoslavia invited for the next summit the zagreb
the this summit will not the democratisation the croatia hailed be but will and that is inevitably the performance the president kostunica in the  be the
the is the the the important the other  that to assure that the return the yugoslavia in the international community the their by the european union granted support the not few way will reduce
there must sufficient attention are for the sensibilities the all countries in the balkans they must the security have that they in the general euphoria on the  the president kostunica not will be forget
the the summit the zagreb must also the next affairs the the agenda to are the announcement by the eu the its programme programmes for aid reconstruction democratisation and stabilisation the for the the western balkans a confirmation the the gradual creating the a trade between the european union and the western balkans and a promise the the countries in the region to to to to regional cooperation and to a  between the countries between to create
the debate the now cut and to at resumed
mrs pack has a point the item
i hope that the indeed a point the item is and not continuation the the debate with the mr moscovici
the the the mr moscovici could unfortunately enough not present are when i the floor was
i would like the him know or he favour is the the supplement the the objectives the the cards with a additional objective namely support for education and training in europe
that is a important new objective in the cards
the commission is this favour the i would like know or that also for the council applies
this issue seems i interesting and seems the support to have the the commission
we will its in the council deal
time council
the the item is the time for questions the the council b
question no the h
the  why is this proposal not formally discussed under the french presidency although the predecessors definitely the the subject have work
the commission has may on the committee the permanent representatives a proposal presented to a  in to to
the meet we the the expectations the the state and government as expressed the the european council in helsinki in the framework the the report on the develop the the european capacity for civil and military crisis they had to a regulation asked example a by the commission in to to fund for rapid financing order a up financing possible to make the the contribute the the european union the operations the other institutions and as need activities the nongovernmental organisations to finance
with the mandate the the committee the permanent representatives the this project further examined by the group advisers external relations the the council
the november has a first treatment place
objective is as soon possible a regulation the to to which the council course first the opinion the your sitting must hear
thank you very for this answer
when i this question very was there in the council there the a impasse and was there not discussion place and that was now exactly the reason for the submit the the question
i note however with pleased that there now movement in the council is and that we in the commission foreign affairs on a copy have the your most recent document which you outlines how the compromise look will to see
gentlemen presidentinoffice president you you know what the opinion is the the parliament and we have understand that you the plan you next month in december a decision to take
if i you say that the parliament on this subject in january debated you you than prepared the to wait what our opinion is before you your decision the
i can only the conclusion the my answer repeat namely that we us the objective to as quickly possible a regulation the to to but that the council this on the opinion the the european parliament must have
as are the rules
because the questions nos and on a similar subject to be they together dealt
question no the h
the the western sahara the and september were a delegation the the intergroup peace for the people the sahrawi the the european parliament which i part occurred a visit the the camps the the  in 
we have this the highest authorities the the democratic arab republic sahara  met with particularly the president  the representatives the minurso
this mission has good  done for the drafting the the finalisation before the the organisation the a referendum on the selfdetermination that in the by the moroccan government and  signed plan for a regulation the the secretarygeneral the the united nations is for
the delegation has the that the refugees under tragic circumstances life
the continuing postponement the the referendum and the failure the the negotiations in berlin the september commission have the the population large distress and disappointment bring the
we have can modified that the the european union definitely the expect that they the more commitment for a regulation the this conflict that the whole region 
can the presidency the the council inform accordance the request the the european parliament in are resolution the march what initiatives the intends is to take to a active role to play order to guarantee that the plan the the un fully the applied
question no the h
the referendum on selfdetermination the the western sahara the current discussions between the international mediator james baker member the the secretarygeneral the the un and the parties in conflict on the the the a referendum on selfdetermination the the western sahara are blocked
the the sitting the september commission in berlin have the moroccan authorities mentioned the the possibility the plan to let see and therefore the to steps the the idea the a referendum
the president the the commission has for november a visit the morocco and algeria planned
what initiatives be currently by the council undertaken or what measures think the council to take the support the the plan so the referendum as soon possible the taken so the risks be avoid the the resumption the the conflict for the region with the that would to
what is the political assessment the the council with the to the current impasse and what are are principles for a contribution the a fair solution the the conflict
the council the the european union supports the process the the united nations
he supports the efforts the the special envoy the the secretarygeneral the the united nations james baker to for the western sahara a fair solution to find the for both parties acceptable is the mr baker seems i currently somewhat in up taken by other obligations but that is the on
the council is ready to to help a  between the parties to develop
a regulation the the conflict in the western sahara must contribute the the stability the the maghreb and the are economic and social development
but that the not way that this dossier under the responsibility the the united nations is and the the special envoy the the secretarygeneral whose perseverance in this complex dossier our support deserves
the mr baker objective with are mission since few months a most objective after one must the problems resolved be the the arise the the implement the the plan the approach that must lead to a referendum on selfdetermination under the population the the western sahara hand must there a political agreement be closed
just have the parties again four months postponement been see resolution to the the both fronts in to effort
the council makes the however ensure on the situation the the document the humanitarian and food the the  in tindouf
the active involvement the the european union in this must still the agree stressed be the european union is the most donor the humanitarian aid the the refugees in the western sahara by the 
we have million euro allocated for the period and there the now a programme the million euro for eight months per november
thank you for your answer
you clearly on a solution the for both parties acceptable is
i i itself the camps the tindouf visited where this very difficult situation already year 
we must unfortunately see that one the both parties i mean here morocco the less being to the implementation the the plan to guarantee while the that however signed has with the agreement the houston morocco is the diplomatic level a global and has on all resources the a the but can have
the country remains but talk on the issue the are territorial immunity this are the very the the king in the particularly in are last 
the is here however the to the  the a people and the a implementation the resolutions the the united nations
how the referendum also you independence or  the morocco the seems i that the democratic therefore effective procedure the appropriate way is to this conflict last the to solve
otherwise would a escalation the the current tension and a possible resumption the the armed fight a risk content for the whole region and that precisely the the at that we we had the there here just still on the euromediterranean partnership new life in want revive
how can we this again new life reclassifications if the conflict still 
we know all the close links between the european union and morocco and more in the particularly between france and morocco i would the mr moscovici the next question want to what are the content and the nature the your current discussions with the moroccan government on the western sahara
as you probably the know has the moroccan minister the foreign affairs the september the the end the the sitting in berlin a statement sent the confirms he still agree that he prepared is all resources in to to to a final and sustainable solution from to work
 seems now understand to have that are proposal not hour the the expectations the the secretarygeneral the the united nations and his special envoy and that the a proposal must produce that can lead to a  the a fair and final solution
morocco has therefore the october are minister the foreign affairs and international cooperation to new york sent so he in decided session by the security heard could be this after the the october the secretarygeneral the the  had heard
in are speech has the mr am  indicated that he in the next sitting the both parties under leadership the the mr baker a completely dossier with content and extent the the moroccan proposal will present
according the mr am  had morocco in berlin only a freelancing in large lines raised
the position the france is that the willingness the morocco in berlin has shown a first step is in the direction the a way from the current impasse the the find the a regulation
the is there still not basis for the avenue the a solution this will morocco a more exactly and content political proposal must do which all parties account can the
this say we our moroccan partners
the the mr the president mr the president the the council the influence the the european union in the maghreb would many greater are if they the more the the reform in morocco involved admirer
how the the with the agreement with morocco
you know that we on the agreement have discussed
also this must a solution be found
the issue the the agreement is however very urgent
question no the h
the safe transport the radioactive substances within the eu what consultation has place between the council ministers the transport environment and energy and the french presidency and the permanent group the experts for safe transport the radioactive substances within the eu before or after the german government in september has announced that they the crossborder transport the radioactive material that to leave in may was any like resume
the fr the transport the  within france shortcomings in agreement with the legislation the this area with particularly directive ec the the council the november on the mutual adaptation the the legislation the member on the transport the dangerous substances on the way and directive ec the the council the july on the mutual adaptation the the legislation the member on the transport the dangerous substances per rail are the application the the transport the  and contain a number technical rules on vehicles see and packaging
the organisation the the transport the  between france and germany is subject the bilateral consultation between both countries the this consultation is or the council the ministers or the french presidency involved
i can only inform that france and germany the and i am now not more if president the the council the this issues during a bilateral summit in  previous week the the item have the and that decided is to up the a group to the problem the to solve
the sorry i the minister to must inform that he fact not answer has given the my question
i early what consultation there place between the council the french presidency and the permanent group the experts
i proposed the question because approximately three weeks after the group the experts the the council the permanent group safe transport the radioactive substances in april a report had published which was pointed that the way which waste was transported not only risk for the health proved the transport contaminated were were as the minister know is
since the to apparently the the point the this transport to resume and the does i welcome to hear that there pressure the like must i one thing the the heart is the group the the concerns with waste still the credible
the group proposed that everything good in item was and then were the transport contaminated were
in this the question i you why make only representatives the the industry and the authorities part from the this group the experts
why is there not area for independent experts the have on detailed information the relevant would can are
must i the minister questions to a clear answer the this questions
the fr we have the i repeat the again the decided to up the a group
the the here a mainly bilateral matter you can there however certainly the are that we sincerely the plan are to results to make
the is there not to certain elements to delete but to this problem the to solve
question no the h
the initiate the initiatives the the eu in the conflict between armenia and azerbaijan the years conflict between armenia and azerbaijan has the economic development the the two countries paralysed the and has a serious impact had the their social tissue
the presidents the armenia and azerbaijan the mr robert  and the mr   have other during the last year least time met international herald gallery the
to now to is the eu a passive observer has the the efforts the the two countries and has they not only initiative this taken which they other strategic interests the area has left to their populist to to do
what diplomatic initiatives think the council to take for the rapprochement between armenia and azerbaijan the solution the the bilateral conflicts and the promotion the the cooperation between the two countries
the fr the stability and the development the the caucasus forms a the the strategic priorities the the european union
as you know supports the european union the current birdal to to to to a political solution for all conflicts in the region the basis the the respect the the territorial integrity the the involved states and the basis the a reasonable extent the autonomy
the union follows the discussions between armenia and azerbaijan to a solution to find for the issue nagornokarabakh than also the the footing therefore welcomes the union the meetings the regular between both presidents place and clearly they the wish from that this meetings will lead to a political solution
the european union remains that convinced that the group the  the osce a central role must play the the creation the a solution for the conflict on nagornokarabakh already are the various proposals the in and by this group are done rejected by both  if 
the union makes also use the all resources the its in the framework the the partnership and cooperation the available are the end a contribution to make the the improvement the the relations between the two countries
thanks the different  is the possible been a structural political dialogue the the to to the to objective has the contacts between armenia and azerbaijan to facilitate
same remains the union both countries in important extent equipment support by means the different programme programmes in the particularly tacis
the union has offered crossborder projects the common important to finance to the to to the the restoration the the good understanding between the two countries
the commitment the the european union is openly recognised by armenia and azerbaijan the have declared prepared to are to their relations with the union to up
the el with your regarding mr the presidentinoffice president but i am not satisfied on your answer this was a formally answer a answer that i perhaps the a public can expect but that in not case a political initiative to expression brings
for the stabilisation the the achieved are time initiatives and a comprehensive plan need
as i in the newspaper i can read has the european union the recently on a other go thrown what its strategy the to the seems too the the now more direction former soviet what this also may mean for this area
therefore can the european union not omit ensure how the situation the this development i i my question course not the to to say how welcome i am with the good the the affairs but because the situation i the certainly to give the
i i can this situation the point be for a integrated policy for a similar policy if we the last time for the balkans have discussed the european union would with other words the initiative must take to a new pact for the achieved a pact that to objective has the development the autonomy and the democracy the very the area to promote
the el mr the president i part the question the the mr souladakis also i would like want know what initiatives the european union think to develop to a solution to find for this enormous problem a problem that a rich area from from the situation to out which the the is to to are
a the the most causes of is the embargo that turkey has imposed the armenia therefore like i the presidentinoffice president questions or in the current negotiations and discussions with turkey ever they the than passing the lifting the the embargo that turkey has imposed the armenia the there is the
the fr i i understanding for the positions the both members to the have the on the action the the union as that has place i i nothing to to add
what the discussions with turkey the we have this recently a extremely important debate held
this the author present is lapses the question no
question no the h
the proposal the prevent the the hide the refugees the french presidency has few proposals tabled to tightening the the legislation the regard the people the illegal refugees transport or hide
the proposals apply for all the refugees conceals even if he this without profit does
accordance the proposals have the member the the eu also the possibility organisations the refugees hide the various ways to penalties and even to dissolving
is the presidency the opinion that this any harms also must apply for project organisations as churches monasteries and parties
the fr the tragedy the dover last june has embarrassing clear made that the necessary is to illegal clutches more to combat
the european council the feira has last june the council asked to up introduction the measures the fight the illegal clutches as down in the conclusions the the european council the tampere the october
the directive is at the the defining the the understanding aid the entry movement and illegally residence the decision has to objective the criminal framework to strengthen the end to can action against this aid the entry and illegally residence
this texts the for opinion are presented the the european parliament are currently in treatment the the this competent working the the council
the texts aim in essentially the fight the organised beings
objective is the criminal organisations the the this guilty make the to roles and to before
the question the the gentlemen member offers the presidency the the opportunity to certain misunderstandings from the way to overcome
objective the the on texts is not to potential refugees to prevent to their right from to exercise to the the territory the the union asylum the to questions
the gentlemen member will the with i agree are that a potential refugee not larger facto a illegal immigrant is
the on texts have nor to objective organisations without profit to among the the implementation the their tasks as they least the relevant law and legislation in eight take
the is therefore to the fight against criminal organisations the involved are the beings and not to the dismantle the nongovernmental organisations political or religious organisations and charitable unless this the what i i however not can proposals the if considerations would must for illegal practices
the da we are the agree agree that the situation in dover a response requires but they brings to my opinion also a another problem under the attention
in the danish media saw we a  afghan lad the his that the without the aid the a nonnational not can flights
he used literally the floor nonnational what that the how difficult the is for people the the the flight are to a area to flights where they asylum can applications that is according i the core the the problem
the the way to humanitarian acts more and more in the criminal atmosphere and i like the council like questions what are position this is
we are us in a difficult situation where immigrants and refugees often by other achieved be
what think the council
if we this area further criminalise than to we to the that only the unscrupulous  and the money agrifood people may
like the council there with are policy really to contribute that the money the poor safe people in the pockets the the mafia and similar organisations ends
the thrust the the european texts is i i that any member the measures must take the need are to the determination facilitate the by means the direct than the indirect aid the entry movement or illegally residence the are territory the a national the not resident is the a member the the union to can financed if punishable fact
this is the deeper idea
mr the president i am welcome with the answer the the council the the original question
i like only that the minister again stressed that this proposal the address the those the abuse make and benefit the people the the in a desperate situation are and not to objective has the immigrant or potential immigrant further to criminalise
the is is that awareness not longer currency can we from immigrants
and that is exactly what there in dover is happened
that there people in a lorry the death have found was the work the the organised crime the people the money the this people did to deserve and this must a end to to
i would the council also want questions and the this point am i the agree with mrs frahm to the member the to encourage a more distinction to make between asylum and illegal immigrants
the member make currently the impression not exactly more to know what their international obligations are
there there the certainly a international agreement that asylum decent and according certain specific procedures must be dealt
a number member seems currently asylum and illegal immigrants on one same to together
the fr i can the reading the the mr martin confirm objective is fight the criminal organisations the involved are the beings and not revision the the existing legislation the on which potential refugees the the territory the the union asylum should applications
only this is the to
the clarification like i there still the add that the there in this two texts mainly to is the criminal framework to strengthen to to can action against networks for beings
this is the type facts and organisations the we resolutely want combat
the sv mr the president mr the minister despite the explanation the i i been understand still still not why this  and partly  proposal all is tabled
would the not fairer and logical are that the governments and the council would give on the reason why people forced are to the illegal in europe to draw
i would the minister want questions the how countries the eu currently a abide demand are that there ten
are the there fifty or are the perhaps hundred countries
according the last data the i i is the to countries
true this figure
if the true take you this than reasonable and take you this a humane asylum
the fr i can here further not answer the give
question no the h
the murders in turkey any year are in turkey thousands women the victims the murders
although have women according the turkish law same rights if men but in the practice condemn many the men women still still the death because they are there because they  committed or because they simply its have with other men
men the this murders committed to rarely longterm prison sometimes to they there with not more than two year from
the new legislation the in turkey the prepared on a ban the  is necessary but still many important is that  the from the murders the matter against the islam counter
this are legislation and initiatives to enlargement the the discussion and awareness necessary
how and when intend the council the turkey effective measures to demands in the fight against 
the gentlemen member has the attention the the council located the the issue the the  in turkey
this practices seem in anachronism to are and to to apparently only still the the rural for
the council remains however concerned on this crimes the often place under unacceptable circumstances
the turkish government has reforms in the the the must lead to a more approach the this crimes the course in fight are with the national legislation
in the report that the turkish council the ministers the september on if programme has adopted be in the part with the legislative different projects mentioned inclusion in the turkish civil code the measures the must contribute the the actual equality the men and women the  area intensive fight the domestic violence more punishing the this violence by the supply the specialised judges and to finally a ban the the possibility the  for 
you can that assured are that the council strict will ensure the the implementation the this measures the the respect the the earlier length discussed criteria the copenhagen to expression to
 are in any case not specific turkish problem since they in a large number countries prevent
the council has than also the dutch initiative supported to this year in the framework the the third committee the the general sitting the the united nations a resolution against this crimes in to must this resolution is still in treatment
the council notes the that turkey this initiative also has supported
also already is difficult to understand how a pray phenomenon if murders declared can be is the in any case a fact that there any year decades turkish women doubt be killed by their brother father nepotism or spouses with if reason that the honour the the family saved must be
for the family and in the particularly for the men in the family be status honour and good name the by their property and this the the women families under
male families have according this way the competence and the duty to a female ancestors to the life to to the its gentlemen the importantly women to the a or other reason has reduced
the does there not to or that voluntary or  is happened that like say or they already than not there is
the is good that the council the the the initiatives the taken are
the is important to  to ban but the is still important to the general acceptance the murders against to to
i i the next question the the council you you prepared to strong measures to take to the  to break by example to demands that islamic leaders the officially the murders from
the fr i am the opinion that this crimes indeed with all possible resources must be fight and i i the that the council the the union the general sitting the the united nations and to i believe the turkish government to prepared are
this outdated practices must be eradicated
question no the h
the attitude the the french minister for european affairs moscovici the austria in a interview with the french channel france has the french minister for european affairs pierre moscovici the repeat a fundamentally attitude welcome against the austrian government
he was there further the convinced that the coalition the the övp and party handling was and that the party a racist and xenophobic party was
how declared the council that a official representative the the french presidency even after the positive believe the the point on austria and the subsequent lifting the the unjustified sanctions against austria a such fundamentally aggressive and of attitude its the a full member the the european union without that this the 
can the council explain or this statements the the french minister for european affairs also the attitude the the french presidency reflect or that moscovici this statements the personal title has done
can the council confirm that the statements and the attitude the moscovici not lead to disadvantages and a unequal treatment the austria in the framework the the important and large european projects
when is the council intends the openly to from the the statements the moscovici and with a correction to to
the fr when this question was the early i i indeed the what this french minister the european affairs has said when he and i quote the question against the austrian government the repeat a fundamentally attitude has welcome
he was there further the convinced that the coalition the the övp and party handling was and that the party a racist and xenophobic party was
the author goes how declared the council that a official representative the the french presidency a such fundamentally aggressive and of attitude remains adopt the a full member the the european union without that this the 
can the council explain or this statements the the french minister for european affairs also the attitude the the french presidency reflect or that moscovici this statements the personal title has done
can the council to finally confirm that the statements and the attitude the moscovici not lead to disadvantages and a unequal treatment the austria in the framework the the important and large european projects
when is the council intends the openly to from the the statements the moscovici and with a correction to to
afternoon not and since i the minister know can i you behalf the council now already a answer give
in answer the the by the gentlemen member set question the the presidency that that the political situation in austria and the bilateral measures the by the other member the regard the austria are adopted and then lifted not the under the responsibility the the council since the the to bilateral measures was
the presidency can therefore not january give on this issue
the clearly however themselves that the only penalising or unequal treatment the austria and are government not there can are since the measures are lifted
the personal title can i you however inform that the statements the the on minister the the channel france has done representative are for are views on this subject
the the mr the president mr the president the the council from your answer that that you personally the council 
your personal prejudice are contrary with the austrian reality and the report the the point and influence your function if president the the council that is during the preparation the the tour the the capitals the the french president and the french president the the council clear has
when will you your his whole to the spirit the robert schuman and accordance the content the the report the the point and the austrian reality exercise without you by your personal prejudice to let lead
the fr on this subject i i itself not prejudice as any another can i a political analysis make the the nature the the government
i must the say that the experts in their report the qualifications racist and xenophobic use least in the form the questions
for the other can i you in my capacity the presidentinoffice president assure that this views the not few way the influence are
repeat the the not few way
the austrian government is the legitimate government the a member the the european union with the composition the the government can the the the or not agree are
that there measures are set is moreover because fourteen other countries the with the composition not agree were
currently are the measures lifted and to we therefore with this government to as with any other government
in community the is this moreover still the case been since the measures bilateral were
i can you therefore support assure that the austrian government in community the the as if whole equal the the other governments the austrian government the in the framework the this presidency part in all councils
what the the tour the jacques chirac state and president the the french republic the will course end in vienna
i can this add that the president the the republic safeguard will be monitored by a minister the are government or by the minister the foreign affairs or by myself
next week take there the my invitation in france a sitting place the the european conference on the accession the central and eastern countries
to apparently will mrs  this present are they is the i welcome
this everything in eligible taken is the the important the affairs good from other to the
one is there the french presidency the the european union that the tasks the the has fully objectively effect hand is there the political view the a politician on a political situation must have and this i i the
the the mr the president i am the with the mr moscovici agree that  parties in governments not place have that would in austria also not possible are because the us are such parties banned
my question the the mr moscovici reads why are extreme parties in france not banned and how the the president the the council the  parties in governments
mr moscovici the you i a small comment to i connection the france i connection the the french and the charm the the french men is in the rule 
the at on france and the charm the the french men are all very the effort worth the mr moscovici must the question however if presidentinoffice president the the council answer
are capacity the frenchman and the political situation in france do at nothing the matter
the fr i early i the why you the words in the rule you leinen where the is to the charm the the french i am the opinion that the charm general is that hope i least
i wanted only but say that there not there was the discrimination the what country than also
to a example to give if in my country france tomorrow a extreme party the the power would to the and i am now in my capacity the minister the than would i want that against my country same type measures were set if against austria are taken
there is therefore not there the discrimination the what country than also
i am the opinion that the european union a number values has the the indeed bad treaties with the posts the certain responsibilities by certain countries
that is the political position
this i i clear want make mrs that i matters the austria and in are general the the austrians
the fr the the first question can i you a clear answer give
this measures have their force and their restrictions shown
they are set and again lifted and i am the opinion that there indeed a legal instrument in the treaties must be included
different countries including austria have with the view this amendments the article the the treaty on the european union tabled the to objective have a  in to to that the possible makes recommendations to do the a country which the make that the not up the the values the the european union which same to that country the listened
this is example the proposal the the austrian government
i can you assure that this proposal seriously in recital the taken and to my wanted conviction must we in the framework the the igc the treaty in this sense change
for the other i i the words leftwing and right not leinen since we us than perhaps would lose in a debate on definitions
when you reflect that extreme parties in austria banned are is this the the nothing against we can us however also ask what right is and what not
myself i the issue the the values the the item want to i i the had on the values as the in our texts be mentioned on the values as the are confirmed in the charter the fundamental and in the particularly the that must be recognised the on the fight against all forms the discrimination what the european legislation as high in the hold has are we must respect the this values enforceable
question no the h
the answer the the council the the letter the the turkish minister the foreign affairs i gem the my supplementary question time the september the question h was i in the opportunity the presidentinoffice president the the council to questions how are answer was the the question the the turkish minister the foreign affairs i gem the the fifteen ministers the foreign affairs the the european union has sent and which he tried are own explanation the the decisions the the summit the helsinki to spread
the answer the the presidentinoffice president that he not specific answer this had and are general reference to the summit the helsinki that this the common rule was were clear not answer in the the very specific comments in the letter the gem
can the council therefore inform how are answer reads the the point in the letter the gem which he declared that in the partnership not link can be the between the cyprus and the relations euturkey and that a such link a violation the the conditions the helsinki would content
the fr the turkish minister the foreign affairs the mr gem has indeed a write at the the ministers the foreign affairs the the other member the the european union
the council has this letter not received but course has the presidency the mr gem answer given the text the this answer is informed the all member
what the the partnership for the accession the turkey that you the the item proposed can i you inform that the commission its proposals the november on has tabled time with its reports on the progress the the thirteen countries have made the their way to accession
the council must the proposal now assess
the presidency remains to to adoption the the partnership during the council general affairs the november could this issue the the partnership than not also the the item be the in the answer the the mr vedrine the the mr gem
the presidency has the however the important the this partnership stressed if useful instrument for the formulate the the future national programme for the adoption the the acquis by turkey and for the implementation the the preaccession the the country in agreement with the letter and spirit the the conclusions the the european council the helsinki
i think also that the debate that we just on turkey have held clear makes in what sense the council and the commission to work want to
the el i thank the presidentinoffice president he spoke rightly on the proposal for a decision the the council on a partnership
this is indeed a new element therefore will i ownership the the text the the commission few very specific questions to
is the first for the council a text acceptable the although the application is the turkey but no the floor minority and the floor kurds contains
is the second for the council a text acceptable which under the objectives the long term even not reference the made the the position the helsinki in the with border between a candidate and a member the the european union
is the third for the council a text acceptable which what the issue cyprus the the little serious position the the commission does according result turkey the efforts the the secretarygeneral the the un must support would the not rather must say that turkey a solution must accept the on the the resolutions the the un
the fr what the the problem the with particularly the kurdish minorities think i that who just to the debate has listened has understand that this issues know are and that both the commission if the council this account the
the political regulation for cyprus the you as mr alavanos will during the discussions with turkey course the the item be the also have we us in helsinki this down
i i that that this political dialogue together with the future partnership for the accession a the the elements the the preaccession for turkey is what the the opportunity are down
the council general affairs the next monday november will to in detail debate on the proposal on the partnership for the accession that only by the commission is formulated and that explicitly and detailed refers to the conclusions the helsinki
in this sense want we to work to the presidency the the council will everything in the work to to to a good agreement to to
the el mr the president i am however the what surprised
we are with a certain situation faced and this would i like a answer want the the minister the first the in the conclusions the helsinki that the solution the the issue cyprus not condition is for accession the cyprus
the problem regarding cyprus is however not as but a problem
this problem was caused by a invasion by the occupation the a large document territory the a member the the un the a candidate for accession to the european union by a another country also member the the un and candidate for accession to the european union
say we now that the end the this occupation not condition is for the solution the the issue cyprus
how see you further the position the the mr gem the this has the mr moscovici not answer the given the according result the in the partnership the turkey with the european union not account must the with the issue cyprus
there therefore the possibility that this partnership and the accession be promoted without that a end the made the the occupation the cyprus and without that turkey the turkishcypriots from cyprus 
if that as is must the you not surprised that we the european union if a imperialist organisation as
the fr i was present during the european council the helsinki also in the chamber when this issues were dealt
i am i that aware that we the and the mean i the fifteen member including greece the the candidacy the turkey have accepted
this have we done by extremely detailed conclusions the to to which we now and in the future are bound
therefore and therefore only is the
the fr this is a 
i i not said that the where is that turkey a  regime has i i said that if the european union this logic accept the that like say the possibility that turkey one sign to the european union and hand a large part the cyprus occupied remains the the there not must be said that we not reason have to the european union if  to country
the fr in my answer was not there the a 
this the author present is lapses the question no
question no the h
the consequences the the agreement with morocco and the characteristics that can this agreement in the light the the most recent negotiations between the european union and morocco for end november to the be the
what characteristics will this new agreement have
provides this agreement in the most needs the the fishing and with particularly in the needs the the involved regions the objective
the fr the community objective to the negotiations for a new agreement with morocco as soon possible the to the
in this respect vote the recently agreed  the one sitting per week us optimistic where the the early conclude the this negotiations the
although in this stage difficult to for is what the final characteristics the this agreement will are seems the clear that this a framework for cooperation and partnership the the area the the fisheries must be created that wider is than that the the previous agreement while the scope also the extended to the whole fishing
the agreement will also account the with the need to a sustainable exploitation the the resources to guarantee and the to to the the development the the moroccan fishing
although the still to early is to to can the in what the characteristics the the future agreement will answer the the expectations the the fishing can the council the gentlemen member assure that the council the if are main objective as to the important that the community fishing has the a sustainable  the the moroccan waters safe to to
i can you assure that the council the very the aware is the the needs the all involved region programmes in the particularly the the region programmes which the economy in important extent on is the this agreement
the community will ensure ensure that in the agreement account the taken with this needs
mr the president i am the president the the council very grateful for this positive answer the is in a the respect optimistic and hope
we must good aware that the agreement with morocco many more is than only a agreement if we this agreement not the means that without more a deterioration the the relations between the european union and morocco
my question is or the french presidency the the next weeks is working to this agreement last to the to to
mr the president the the council the is certainly necessary that the french presidency the the to this  the commissioner fischler there the the they the the necessary mediterranean mythological to a agreement to the to to
 a   in the province granada will still earlier a port or even a greater port to than that commissioner fischler success meeting in a purely mediterranean matter
against this background is my question or the french presidency that the the necessary like and the necessary mythological has after eleven months the  fleet are shoulders under the agreement is to for andalusia and galicia regions the objective is this agreement a suffocated
for more europeans to country and the sea is the fact urgent necessary that the agreement there now last is
the fr i i not idea especially this on this agreement not the negotiated by a within the the mediterranean rigorous but by the commissioner for agriculture and fisheries the mr franz fischler
i doubt there however not the that he demonstrated will give the the necessary sensitivity
i i with my answer not excessive optimistic and hope want are but i especially want say that the presidency the the european union to objective that we a good agreement can conclude
what a good agreement is
a good agreement is a agreement the account the with the community views and with the interests the all region programmes within the european union
i i good note taken the your concern the the same possible makes to with morocco to agreement to to
this to we us in and this is the way the we will to
the es mr the president i i also a question to
a comment ex is that the mr fischler or from the area the the mediterranean sea or from the area the the atlantic atlantic from is also have we the does that the directorgeneral fisheries from the north the the atlantic area is and only know he with the problems in the fishing when he recently in the function was appointed
my question the the minister is in this the the next morocco the for the fleet the galicia andalusia the canary islands and portugal in the moroccan waters in principle to least a quarter back to to
the proposed agreement is for two in place the five year also want they that the european union the billion esp pays the they now also pays
the political like the the community negotiators in the practice not in theory have shown was absolutely taxable or in any case over not
i am than also extremely sceptical on the outcome the the negotiations
my question is the next take the minister that we can negotiate on the order  and on enforcement the the costs the the agreement with morocco for the european union with the of
the fr my answer on the nordic or mediterranean origin was a response the a joke the the president and was itself also if joke intended
the commissioner is behalf the whole european union responsible with agriculture and fisheries irrespective or the commissioner from is from the south north central or east
i can you only but the progress the the negotiations the the area the the fisheries give
commissioner fischler has the different occasions about with the highest moroccan authorities
there have two technical meetings place the july in  and the and september in brussels
during this meetings has the community delegation under leadership the directorgeneral smith measures proposed what they in the framework the a new agreement with morocco prepared was order the development the the moroccan fishing to promote
the community delegation has also tried a timetable for the negotiations the to to
we must however see that morocco the the opportunity not the the supply the the union is entered
since we the impression had that morocco the negotiations  early commissioner fischler for october a new maintenance with prime  the he had a meeting with king mohamed vi prime  and the new minister the seafishing the mr 
the seems that that this meetings end have led to the start the the negotiations and the october was there a new sitting with a moroccan delegation place that was therefore very recently
i am than also the opinion that there a direction must be down that there not excessive optimism the the day must be the but nor unreasonable pessimism
question no the h
the fundamental and  is the council the that aware that the circumstances including in the channel arrested foreign when in are are often not the the in the european treaty the protection the the rights the the human legislation provisions on arrest and the right the a honest process meet
is the council the the informed the a similar serious concern with the to the portuguese 
is the council therefore prepared all proposals on mutual recognition the judgments in criminal the to suspend until the minimum the the area the the human in all member fully be observed
the fr mr the president gentlemen member the is not the the council to the from to let on the by the gentlemen member mentioned actions what the the territory the a the the member are the and in fight would are with the principles the the by all member signed and ratified european treaty the protection the the rights the the human
since the the is to application the the principle the mutual recognition the judgments in criminal accordance the conclusions the the european council the tampere must the there the aware the to give that this principle not only must lead to a reinforced cooperation between the member but also to protection the the human
the principle the mutual recognition the judgments in criminal presupposes a mutual confidence the the member in each systems
this confidence is now precisely based the minimum the with particularly where the the procedures the the which the acceptance a condition is for the apply the the principle the mutual recognition
the member the the european union have with other common that they the bound consider the the principles the freedom democracy respect the the human and the fundamental freedoms and the the rule
by this in the treaty on the european union established values high to the can the council are work the the area the mutual recognition the judgments in criminal out
mr the president i i here for i a document are that from is the a the my electorate the person in issue has the sent been in the prison the  in the north the france three months after he this for the first was they the suspicion the a violation the the 
the document is the in the french and there were not translation or  available
this person is now now already five months in the butyrsky
i i also a letter in my possession the the point the a other their from my constituency which they my attention question for the fact that its brother already since march the similar when parody
such prisoners should not own lawyer choose
they to a lawyer allocated the their matter must defend
this lawyer the only rarely the effort to them to visits or from to to what the  is
the is here to citizens from scotland the country where someone the in the the charges is the after days foday disdain must be  disdain must be released which applies that the never more for same offence can be were
in the european union there not common law because the standards as major and the not few way the met the the standards from article the the treaty to protection the the rights the the human is the unacceptable to the proposals the the council by to to
the fr indeed i wanted only but say that a package measures for application the the principle the mutual recognition the judgments in criminal precisely possible is because we this sensitive are
that is where the to is
mr the president a point the item there are still twenty minutes the the time on there are very little members present and there there not risk that the time the exceeded
i like you than also questions permission to give for the to the two supplementary questions
supplementary questions must by other members be the
you has your question again formulated in agreement with the rules
question no the h
the the energy the the eu the energy in europe is a matter the not under the powers the the community regards but under the the the member the stated recently the commissioner for energy
the the beginning the the discussions the the intergovernmental conference was there a proposal done to in the treaty the amsterdam special provisions the to take the the door would open to for a common energy
this proposal was by the rejected as also already the case was been the the treaty the maastricht
course there there actions the energy as the paper the programme save billion euro in the the research actions for alternative promotion etc
that the not way that the dependence the the eu the imported energy gas oil coal and uranium in the future only but will continue increase as from various forecasts that
the is clear that the developments the the  a dynamic policy the the eu the energy require the what way think the council a reduced dependence the the european economy the introduced oil to achieve
are there specific measures taken  the the area the the  and a more energy to ensure to ensure that the economies the the member in lesser extent sensitive are for crises the outside with what resources and what priorities the short and medium term objective the council to a more and more energy
the council is the aware the the increasing important the the dependence the the european union the imported energy and the the gentlemen member the the conclusions the the council the may
the council its in this the the highest priority the activities the the next areas promotion the the exploitation the renewable energy  continuity the the energy and diversification the energy
what the renewable energy the the competent bodies the the council the the currently on a proposal on the promotion the with this energy difficulty electricity order during the next session the the council in december a agreement to can the if the european parliament against the time least opinion has given
what the  the has the commission during the session the the council in may on a action proposed
the basis the this programme would the council in december next conclusions on a list the priority actions must adopt the the hand which the commission the issue programmes can the which the member community measures or precisely only coordinated measures wish
the commission has in the communication on the  the the european union the they the october has adopted indicated that they intends is the the european council the gothenburg a programme for energy and diversification the energy for to to this programme would must contribute the a higher  with particularly in the construction and the transport
what the continuity the the energy the is the commission intends in the during the november a green on the future and the place the the different energy in the framework the a better continuity the the energy the the european union for to to
in this communication will both nuclear if renewable energy the the item to
after reception the the communication will the council this certainly the highest priority to
the presidency has also a conference on the continuity the the energy been what the november in paris taken will be
the fr mr the presidentinoffice president the the council i like not deny that i my question in the first place proposed to to know to to what projects and what timetable there are the you you given which you thank
i proposed my question however also to to see or you in the would are information or estimates to give the the council would can use to to to to a closer cooperation and a type communitisation the the energy as we during the recent crisis have can see to the member because  to work and compete they other both what the energy if the prices the
nor like i deny that i perhaps the find was to ideas
few mr programmes have proposed the and this join i i the the the to information and plans the to to for example a policy that in certain countries the euro if means for oil procedural
this issues the i and to i believe all inhabitants the the union are since the the not only is to quantitative but also to economic and financial dependence
the fr this are interesting suggestions the certainly a debate worth are but i can there behalf the council the this at not answer the give
i believe indeed also that we for the issues the energy in their general more with one voice must can speak the is the because to problems the within the european union in any case coordinated must be tackled
question no the h
the new  for a embargo against cuba not only the cuba but also in europe has the new marketing that now in the usa in treatment is for a storms the protests taken
under the pretext the the abolition the the ban the the sale the first includes medicines and medical equipment from the usa the cuba the the embargo considerably strengthened and be still many more obstacles raised for the trade as the strengthening the the restrictions with the to the travel the americans to cuba or according the international rules unacceptable regulations for the not finance the the sale by  and banks and the guarantee of by third countries or the payment in counterfeiting
what initiatives think the council to take to the approval the this marketing in the usa to prevent that a violation means the the rules for the international trade and what steps is he the plan to take with the view the the overall abolition the the embargo against cuba and the restoration the normal trade the this country with all countries and with particularly the member the the eu
the fr the measures which the gentlemen member refers be mentioned in the marketing for the budget that the october is signed by president clinton
the position the the union the regard the the by the united states  extraterritorial measures is unamended has
i believe that this position well know is the the members the the european parliament the union nothing any opportunity the to its position the the united states clear to make
we must unfortunately however the that the american government still not the obligations is fulfilled the they itself in the framework the the during the summit the london in may closed agreement is made
we to the american government than also the this obligations after to to since we the opinion are that the here a factor the the a important role plays the the solve the this dispute
the objective the the european union with the to cuba as expressed in the the december by the council the common position on cuba there in the encourage the a peaceful process in the direction the democratic pluralism respect the the human and the fundamental freedoms and restoration and improvement the the living the the cuban population
part the this objective is further the urge the the cuban regime to the cuban legislation and the implementation of the to apply the the international standards
during the vote on the resolution on the embargo have we in the framework the the third commission the the general sitting the the united nations the november on than also a appeal done the the cuban authorities to their full cooperation to to the international organisations the stand for the human
the european union is pleased to can report that cuba very active is has in different international and regional fora
the union recognises also that by the cuban government measures are taken for a better economic integration the cuba in the region
the union the the the need the a gradual and irreversible opening the the cuban economy for the abroad and declared cuba in this process to want help
to finally the the european union with concern knowledge the the findings the the offices and the programme programmes the the united nations the ground
the union regrets the negative and often dramatic consequences the the economic embargo the america has for the cuban population in the particularly for women and children
the el mr the presidentinoffice president i thank you for your answer
i i heard that you in your answer comment by the the assertion that the cuba the human and the fundamental freedoms not would be respect
you will probably the suspicion that i the this not that agree am apart of am i however the opinion that a such believe interference is in the internal affairs the a another country
basis the your position question i i the or there fact the a difference there between the final objective the the european policy towards cuba and the final objective the the american policy towards cuba
i i like the in both cases simply the socialist regime the the country from the so pop
the fr the is pleasing to see how there do can the because i i at not the impression that i that i said
i i out the the flagrant differences between the united states and europe in their views the regard the the by the united states  extraterritorial measures
i was pleased to behalf the council to can inform that cuba very active is has in different international and regional fora
i i recognised that the cuban government measures has taken to cuba economic better to into in the region and i declared that europe cuba in this process like saying the
to finally i i said that the european union with concern knowledge has taken the the findings the the offices and programme programmes the the united nations the ground have gained and that the union therefore the negative and often dramatic consequences regrets the the american embargo has for the cuban population
i i therefore as approximately the opposite said the what you just said
same must i you that point that the position the the european union on cuba as that the december by the council is the at is the the encourage the a peaceful process in the direction the democratic pluralism respect the the human and the fundamental freedoms and the restoration and sustainable improvement the the living the the cuban population
there the therefore not position welcome the regard the the nature the the regime most contains the position a number words and constant the improvement the the procedure the this regime
if you not the difference between this position and other positions see is that perhaps by a the their lack
question no the h
the violation the the sovereign rights the a member by turkey in the framework the a nato turkey has the facto the sovereign rights the greece the discussion the by the way to paving for greek aircraft the participated the the nato   by the greek fir not to the mile to to let and greek aircraft to against over the islands  and 
how assessment the council this of the the sovereign rights the a eu what the has occurred in the framework the the nato
think he steps the the turkish authorities to take to a end to make the this provocation and as yes what
what will the consequences the this steps are for the links between the eu and turkey especially in the context the the common foreign and security account bearing with the fact that turkey candidate is for accession
the fr what the the incident with the greek and turkish aircraft during the exercise   must to be stressed that this incident the has occurred in the framework the a nato between two member the the atlantic alliance
the is therefore the the nato to the measures to take the they necessary eight to such incidents in the future to prevent
this incident is within the council the the european union moreover not the the item the
in the light the the conflict between turkey and greece in the aegean sea the the council the the conclusions the the european council the helsinki which the the the a peaceful solution the the disputes accordance the charter the the united nations and which the candidate urgent be called everything in the work to to to their any border and other similar issues the to to
if they the not succeed than would they their disputes within a reasonable term must present the the court the justice
to latest end will the european council the still existing conflicts analyse with particularly what the their consequences for the accession and promote that they by intervention the the international court the justice be settled
issues on the solution the the conflicts between greece and turkey make on the general part from the the dialogue on strengthened policy the place in the framework the preaccession the turkey and in the framework the the partnership for the accession which the commission recently a proposal has tabled that the french presidency the the council the very short term like let adopt
the council is also pleased on the fact that the ministers the foreign affairs the turkey and greece during their meeting the october on have decided to in the framework the the nato and the bilateral level to to to the mutual confidence based measures
the el mr the president first is the for us absolutely unacceptable that as the presidentinoffice president said the greek government this issue not in the council has raised this is namely rightly enormous beside caused in greece
the second sent the council us if pontius by by to the nato and the he not only position in the regard the the provocative attitude the turkey that the sovereign rights the greece disputes
this time was the sovereign place the opportunity the  understand the council than not that this a extremely political problem is and are attitude the equal distance between victims and  unacceptable is
the is further a fact that turkey the greek fir the mile and the corridors over  and  disputes although this issues are regulated with the agreements the lausanne and  and with bilateral treaties between turkey and italy and between italy and greece
the you the third not account with the fact that the legal council the the nato the for the rights the greece accordance the international treaties has expressed from the the fact that the nato then under pressure the turkey the the last at the plans for the exercises has amended
the fourth and to finally would i want know or you not the opinion you that you with your answer turkey candidate for accession to the european union a heart under the answers its the the sovereign the sovereign rights the greece member the the european union you the because indirectly to that there border are although in fact everything is regulated with international treaties
the fr i i said what the council the or not done has and what the council had do or draft to must do
for the other think i however that we now a framework have which we this specific problems can solve namely the conclusions the helsinki
i like that point that this conclusions for us all binding are since they the course the unanimously by all member are adopted
the will the council account the the the assessment the this candidacy the today already subject is been the a long and indepth debate
gentlemen members although you but with few you i i you the formal communication that we there for the first during this term in managed are all questions to deal
i know not or everyone there just welcome that is but the is a historic given where we good note the take
the time for questions the the council is closed
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
aid for reconstruction continuation
the the item is the continuation the the joint debate on aid for reconstruction
the el mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes the commission must first its proposals adapt the the conclusions the the council the feira
if members the the european union and if responsible politicians are we all faced with a enormous challenge
i i have we now the historic opportunity to the to show that our action conform with our good intentions the regard the the western balkans
the for the balkans allocated sums must in quality and terms respect answer the a new plan
the must we the countries the the western balkans in the to a new beginning to make the  that this not third countries are but countries for accession to the european union if such must we them also deal
indeed the the european union often the accusation to hear that they the by natural affected countries although aid promises but its financial promises with many to many delay presuppose the gives they sometimes the impression the mind to change
sometimes is they however also simply to late with the money on the bridge
fortunately is there a magnificent exception the the rule confirms because the is the indeed to the rule this exception is the bureau for reconstruction that are seat in thessaloniki has but from kosovo swiftly
one up this bureau the the decision the the commission to decentralised work and hand can this bureau aspect the excellent results the the management the the reconstruction
for the the budget for are already contracts signed what a sensational percentage is
already the the appropriations for are paid and what still never earlier is been for the year has the bureau asked to less appropriations for improve
therefore i i for mr the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen that we this people the really sense have to the hands from the lending to to calm their work let do
let we with our forgive the the method the the bureau reduced and the even the responsibility give for very the federal republic yugoslavia and for each another area where reconstruction necessary is we can even further to and their ask knowhow the available to to the other bodies the as we but already to good know  and too work out and essentially nothing at
i hope the much i that we with this opinions something good can do for this been tried area that with such enormous problems to camps has
the the mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes the few mr programmes the the way yes to have found i must course first the rapporteurs and with particularly the here present rapporteur the i thank for their work and the good cooperation
the speaker for i had the i i rightly on a type plan for this area
if someone money the has he the political privilege the to give what political objectives he the like achieve that has the commissioner also always done
however like i evening again behalf my group briefly from the before do where the the for us to is
the first are we in this area unfortunately still still faced with a situation which the human and the rights the the minorities still still not sufficient be respected
that is simply a fact
therefore must we the first this help where we can help and where we a certain willingness see to in the future more account to the with the human and the rights the the minorities that must us first objective are
the second be in this area international agreements time again the the again the that is last still happened with the region
i remind i still the campaign in bosniaherzegovina which leading politicians the the urgently  not because they the plan were further to to and the more in to to for stabilisation but because they earlier the other on the on the tribunals from wanted to that was a the the most unfortunate ease the the campaign
this must we us clearly against oppose
respect the international agreements means course also and this applies also for urgently the that the together with the view the the the the tribunal the den hague  affairs
we must here with a certain tolerance but decisive action also against kostunica the we here tomorrow received and against the new yugoslav authorities
there are few signals the the good on take but the are there still not enough
the third should we not unilateral  cannot
that applies for montenegro just as good if for kosovo
also here must we a clear clearly position adopt
i like here immediately also say that we the new yugoslavia a opportunity must give and hope will yugoslavia the opportunity know the to intervene
i join  not from if the but not unilateral  are by who than also unilateral  are absolutely from den because
if the borders change than only through agreements
my fourth point is extremely important there be new borders built but there are there the permanent and with the the ease on this borders across job the criminal with their criminal activities
they know not borders crossborder illegal activities must we how than also combat or the the to drug crossborder cooperation or trafficking is
borders must be down but not by criminal activities the unfortunately also in this area crime celebrating and the nothing attract the the the other areas in eight to take maat
also that are objectives the we with our financial resources and the instruments the we now in the life to must see to achieve
i i want also the council and the commission that we in the next years very consistent money available to for such objectives
if we somewhere however lack the willingness see should we this in not case money go send
the el mr the president tomorrow is the new president the the federal republic yugoslavia the mr kostunica the visit in us parliament and a spoke the
are visit can a beacon are for us further policy
i heard however a number previous speakers their about do on the fact that the european union pays but america the highest floor the
that is quite  in bosnia were the because the united states the with the agreement the urgently political action fact and in kosovo were the again the united states the the initiative names to bombing and such
what means this for us
we must from learn that the political the the first plan is or that the political least equal increase must the with all other affairs
the must political objectives achieve and than the the the question what political objectives
the there not doubt that the institutional issues the right force the the democracy a absolute priority forms for very this area
with a right force the the democracy the themselves the conditions for respect the the minorities in the different region programmes
with a right force the the democracy the the situation themselves day
this are however the the right people need
let we the aware that during the transitional in very many cases people the the regime were the populist interests  and in fact not healthy ratified were the the political life in this area
therefore must we in many cases our opinion on people and situations review
my second comment the the with the strategy for this area
the there not doubt that the integration the the economic and institutional prospects in the to follow policy a good development is
good developments take however not long if there not strategic horizon the the
therefore shows the i i no a good service by again the issue to raised to the the seat the the bureau for reconstruction that a year ago with the report the mrs pack was break commissioner patten has enormous experience gained with the management the international crises which he demonstrated has given the large wisdom
he has a visit the the different areas the the balkans perhaps can he also to the seat the the bureau for reconstruction to to thessaloniki to the ground the to to how this bureau working
i am the namely fully agree with what mr folias said and i emphasise that the i
but now enough  let we now the good on look
the lagendijk is as the proposal the the commission a excellent document from the my criticism the a point the the the i i a framework outlined for political initiatives
this framework must however the further be key so also new views the postal can summarise
we must this area if a part the europe see not if a area which countries and national policies the europe or america with other in the hands to
if we think in this area other the challenge to can sails wrong we us
apart of however am i the opinion that we the good on take
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes to to start like i the rapporteurs thank for the excellent reports the they us today present
the parliament late with this documents a clear and firm message hear
i hope that the commission and the council the with the due attention will into and they the two regulations the adequate way will change
we are us that aware that the european support important is for the balkans
the restoration the a democratic political system in serbia means the beginning the a new chapter in this new stage must the union a role play they must not slow and passive observer are as to still to the case was
our economic and technical contribution must relevant and effective are that is the least what the union can do to the region and the whole continent a stable future to guarantee
we must us achieve that the way to the peace in the balkans still long is and that there still potential  are the the progress back can work
but there is still never so hope been for this region the most tried the europe
the almost  croatian regime is replace by a democratic and  regime
the vulnerable countries around the  the yugoslavia have the crisis can survive and that not only bulgaria albania and macedonia have also progress made the economic area
in the stake the subtle stated in the current balkans has the european union a large a enormous responsibility and if we the have on the european union mean we the member but also the european commission and the parliament
the member to wonderful intent the but the must be followed by specific financial commitments
the european commission must the responsibility take for the good operated the this programme programmes that is the first objective the the two reports which we tomorrow will vote
the parliament must regular be consulted and informed that is the second request the the rapporteurs and we must the all support
the the mr the president ladies and gentlemen as from the before text that have the commission and the parliament the war the by the nato only already in serbia is caused kosovo therefore not included the billion euro s the have they indirectly their material  recognised
the nato  in to intervene to worse evil to prevent by this war are however more people  killed and injured has than during the twelve supposedly decisive months for the mr
was this area not only really unstable by the 
end presented the more in the balkans if a legitimacy for the new practised and for the socalled 
now is recognised that war was caused and the situation by the nato was mindanao must ensure be taken that the payments not the half but the full amount the the taboo war cover
the eu must however especially not loans the available to but must the and this applies with particularly for the countries the european union the part of the the nato the payments out to the by its caused damage fully to for
thank you mr the commissioner

asem iii seoul and october
the the item is the statement the the commission on the third meeting asiaeurope asem iii seoul and october
mr the president the you i to the the one continent to the other to job
before report from to to the the third took and the results to evaluate will i briefly something say on the asem
the first summit in was taken in a time the large optimism the regard the asia the people had the on the asian economic miracle
the second summit in was taken in a time the economic crisis many said that asia are best time had had and that the expectations strong excessive were been
the the third summit are we returned to the reality
there was not there the a asian economic miracle but there have in asia many ethical events  and after the crisis the have the most countries the quickly restore
this where this with the most success is happened is this to thank the a combination the economic and political reforms
against the background the this developments have the  place
the challenge for the third summit in seoul was the deepening the the asem for both the participating governments if the large public
there had be demonstrated that there not dramatic events need are to a meeting the european and asian state and government to justify the objectives for asem iii have we formulated in our group
before the summit have we this discussed with the european parliament twice in the  and in the plenary sitting where if i i not mistaken your resolution the october was adopted
addition the adoption the three important documents have the leaders the the summit a indepth discussion held on sensitive issues if the rights the the human the  sea east and burma
they have solemn promised the fundamental rights the the human to promote and to protect and the democracy the rule equality justice and the environment to respect
there is agreed to the political dialogue the high level in the framework the asem to strengthen by force to draw from the diversity the are members and without any issue from to the
the leaders have agreement achieved on a enlargement and occurred the a framework for the  cooperation that the programme will are for the next decade
the need the joint efforts for the implementation the the protocol the kyoto was confirmed there was favour for a dialogue between buying and producers to the oil in the world to stabilise and for reinforced cooperation the the development the savings technologies
there is about on the crossborder crime exploitation the immigrants beings and drugs the unfortunately the same the the globalisation forms
the summit has a individual statement adopted for the peace the the korean peninsula which he the summit between the two korea programmes the june welcome both countries the to continue to build the the reached result and the important stressed the a multilateral dialogue with the democratic republic korea
with the to enlargement is a  adopted according what a candidate first the support the are regional partners must acquire before the request to approval the the other region
the final decision the than in consensus taken by the state and government
the asem iii is not on specific candidates about
the the area the the economic and financial cooperation are the leaders agreed to joint the challenges the the globalisation the information the  and the digital gap the to tackle by the research and university between the two region programmes to strengthen
the leaders have further confirmed that they voluntary reports will drafting on the the the the efforts to the trade as defined in the action the promotion the the trade way to take
the plan to as quickly possible to a extensive new continue to to work with special attention for the specific needs the the developing was s the all 
the social and cultural level recognised the leaders the vital important the reinforced contacts the the area the the education with specific initiatives the for the the mutual understanding as the promotion the the cooperation between universities and electronic networks between schools
the the related level the the human contacts was the principle confirmed to the asem to open to a wider employment the the civil already could the  for a social forum not be implemented by the opposition the few asian partners
i doubt there not the that the parliament will see that this results in the line are the the resolution the october where i the just on had
the rights the the human and the rule are in the process included there was a clear consensus the regard the the need the a early extensive continue but i am there not certainly the that this to far fully to expression is the in the  in national
although the proposal to a social forum in the life to to the not has achieved have we contacts the with the social civil and the ngos programmes and i hope much that there the this area progress will be made in the period to asem iv in copenhagen
finally was there under the leaders agreement to the strengthening the the contacts between members to promote as for in the framework for the cooperation
asem iii was course dominated by the extremely important developments the the korean peninsula the have led to the allcomers the the president the korea for the prize for the peace the career the this man the characterised by are commitment for the democracy the rights the the human and the rule and recently by are commitment for the reconciliation the the south and the north the the peninsula
this has us i i reminded the the important the the role the europe in asia not only the the area the the economy and the trade already must i this the the add that a the the factors for the restoration the asia the fact is been that we floor have taken and our markets not have closed for the implement from asia
the surplus the china with the european union will this year probably billion euro sums
the the area the the economic and  have we floor taken and that is a the the affairs the to contribute that asia us more will take
the is important to that to point that we also a political role must play in asia not only in the form the the promotion the the democracy and good administration but also in the form the a contribution the the korean peninsula and elsewhere the the stability and the safety in the future
the asem is a important process
this was a very valuable meeting
with the time development the process the further and the the more deciding i look already from to the next  in denmark on few years and i am there certainly the that we than will can build the what we already have achieved
the the mr the president mr the commissioner the fact that there as little mr programmes present are is according i to to write the the rapid way the the debates evening few mr programmes the the floor wanted to are still not present because they probably still the the eat are
i request you than also the low presence not to as if a gauge for the important that they the this issue attach
mr the commissioner i am the first with you agree that this asem very important is
the is both political if economic the large important
i had however the like given that both this parliament if also few the your mr programmes in the commission the importance the the relations between asia and europe in the right perspective saw and the also the fisheries the the union in the monitoring did i hope that my spanish mr programmes and also commissioner fischler i this comment forgive
if the the political and economic development in the multipolar world the long term look the the the that the relations the asia with europe and versa the large important are
therefore are we welcome with the summit the seoul where the a or two government after all government present were
that was very important
you had right in positive sense was the asian summit course somewhat in the shadow to are the the development in the two parts the korea
we must however all pleased are on the positive developments this
i am however as free to a comment to make the the to the the poor representative the the council the must your the was course in seoul a painful matter that while certain member the the eu  ambassadors with north from to want exchange other member that not were
we would there good the do if we least a common foreign and security want all fifteen countries a joint decision to let take to with north the same time and under equal conditions relations the to connection that is many better than different state and government solo to let out
i must however support admit that the agreement the could be achieved on the framework for the action cooperation a good matter is
you you mr the commissioner however understand how the content the this agreement in everything is
i i still still the the effort to exactly to understand what the for the next ten year has agreed
i believe that the for the parliament the also if now but little members present are but some will however the minutes read and we the few specialists will how than also the matter in the monitoring the the especially important is that we now involved be the the fulfil the the framework for the action cooperation
i think any that the parliament many to reacts is especially this we in you mr the commissioner a good partner have
we must than also for copenhagen and for the conferences place agreement see to achieve on the content we must if parliament suggestions do for the way which we the by you decided framework can fulfil
the am i the very that the european on the as clear has expressed on the human
we must however the still agree in all upon give on the consequences of on what this change
i i was this a good political make but not all problems are the the world from help
i believe that we if parliament to task have the and fortunately has the this the european on in the conclusions let into the the cooperation between the european parliament and the parliaments the the asian countries after the first  the we few years ago in strasbourg have taken new life in to revive
that is a important task and i hope that the parliament will proposals the second meeting next year briefly for copenhagen to the
this will in asia must place because the first meeting in strasbourg was organised
precisely because you the cooperation between asia and europe from the view the the human and the democracy look is the for i important that we with the parliaments the the asian countries more work and ensure ensure that this cooperation results sooner
mr jarzembowski what the your comment on the small number present if we the commissioner also entitlements is expand the the speakers present
that is however not bad
president we have a month ago already on this matter about and had when a very good discussion with the commissioner
are expected rightly us heart
a positive aspect is course the opening to north the achieved is
unfortunately that this the our on not the resources available are the the there fact the hear
moreover is what us the the result however what duplicating and that is still kind expressed
us problem with asem iii is not much what the is achieved because projects on the laundering the money hiv and aids food and such are course positive
there are even two specific proposals adopted with particularly the table on globalisation and the clarified  program  the orientation the million american dollar
that is course not nothing but this have we however our question the
this come i as the back
important is what there not is adopted
there had so more can done the the point the financial stability trade and investment infrastructure
a  was suggested
that were good affairs been
what we serious find is what there not is have the the area the human
there are things said but we find of nothing back in the projects the are agreed and even not the the area the example properly reserve that had however best done
that properly reserve has moreover also the something to make with the globalisation
we have agreed to us with globalisation are to the and with particularly with the negative effects the that has what us the has globalisation precisely positive effects
negative effects are there but we must however also look to the positive effects
the regard the the  program find we the incomprehensible that the secretariat this in seoul the located
 in singapore work excellent why is that this not together
we know that the commission asem extremely seriously the and we support the commission what that the also the i
the question for us is or our ministers asem seriously enough have taken
we think that they a had lack the ambition have shown and they deserve than also not applause
there are the progress made the the point the the parliamentary dialogue asiaeurope
perhaps can we if parliamentarians to the to what the ministers the this point not is managed
the european commission deserves our support because we are that convinced that they the good on the is
we find however that the ministers a many better result had must can achieve
i i seven motions accordance article member the the rules received
the debate is closed
the vote take thursday place
regional organisations 
the the item is the report on the the mr jové peres behalf the commission fisheries on the communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament participation the the european community the regional organisations  com the c cos
mr the president the regional organisations be still important especially in waters where there is the a shared sovereignty and for the management the migrant or crossborder resources
they forms a extremely suitable means for a rational management the the resources because they are between the the specific characteristics the a certain moroccos
therefore is the the large important that the european union has on the necessary mechanisms to a full and full participation to guarantee
the communication the the commission is only in the the aspects the to make have with the powers the the community and the member for the tasks the resulting from the participation the the regional organisations
this are important aspects but the enough not because we have a clear uniform and homogenous was need for the participation the the european union the the regional organisations given the diversity the the existing organisations will the participation the the community time must be between the the respective characteristics that but same based must are the same legal and institutional principles
the report the the commission fisheries favour therefore for a uniform labour between the community and the member the regard the all regional organisations
the the area the the community actions is a role play for the commission the guarantee the for the community important
the services the the commission will the not should to to the  what they the to now to in the most cases the lack the resources have must to in the future should the services the the commission not longer only if dressing act they must the clear and careful way all aspects in the with the participation the the community the this organisations for their account take both the the area the representation control the the being and examination the data and the participation the scientific fora short in the general the towards the the community policy and the control the the fisheries the in the framework the this organisations place
the control the the fisheries affects the the jurisdiction the the member and consequently in certain extent the the core the their sovereignty
this control must be transferred the a fully community body so the common fisheries the application is the all member and all ships and operators irrespective their nationality as can the barrier the the principle the equal treatment be avoid
therefore must the leadership the the control and gradually the the implementation that be life the the services the the commission what means that the costs that the funded the the community budget must to to
with the view the the legal must the existing mechanisms for the transposition the the community be improve because this to slow are
this speeding the the transposition in community the the provisions the are approved in regional organisations the the circulation the the community fisheries by the council and the parliament not in the way
because the increasing important the the regional organisations  programmes must the european union its full powers the fishing the the take this lot especially the the problem the human and material resources
the commission has to the problem the the resources to were elected for a thorough the the by the community and the member to out tasks without that the respective powers be amended
this approach the the way the transitional acceptable would can are would to serious institutional and  lead if they a permanent nature would to
in the by the commission proposed labour would the community a classed task to the high level while the representation in the scientific and technical committee programmes would be left the the member also the contribution the the work the the regional organisations would be entrusted the the member as the inspection and control
this would that characteristics that the role the the community if contracting party would be reduced to the the dressing
europe can not be built with commitment statements
as there a common fisheries is and the community the the area the the fisheries certain powers has must they the yes to behave and must they the the human and material resources provide the they for the implementation the its tasks need has accordance the principle the adequate resources for the common fisheries
also is the community contracting party the the  programmes and must the yes to behave and the its imposed role also actually to role
the application the this principle brings financial consequences with the that and requires further legal the and perhaps a certain truncated when the however favour for a the political  than must the also the resources provide which a such model can be achieved
mr the president today the day are the regional organisations the best if the only guarantee for the management the the resources in the world and in the future will this in still greater extent apply
this important has the rapporteur very good understand he has a excellent report developed which he the finger the the the real weak point the the communication
this is are good intentions the however only been can be if there there is the real political like
since there in the world but little coastal are with the economic legal legislative and political potential the the european union is the clear that we us the our responsibilities must discussions
nevertheless shows the community not commitment or initiative most responding they
but they responding with as little resources and foresees as little that the the seems if david that from the sent to the fight the to made with  except that david in the bible  what here not the case is
i am observer been the a number regional organisations and i can you assure that the disgraceful is to to see how two or three officials the the  towards by lack the sleep try to respond the problems the the already months could see arrive and this the extremely powerful delegations or because they powers represent as the united states or japan or because they the advance a intelligent policy have held and alliances are made
now the directorategeneral fisheries a process the restructuring place that can lead to more staff and better resources must we i i demands that here in the first place something the the done
this would in the first place mean that the community not more only but would respond the practices if the agreement the the  the clear the intention has to the territorial waters the four countries any from to extend what counter against the minimum the the international maritime or the arbitrary attempts to the community fleets to against while that however the only are the strict standards and legislation must failure
further is the not only the task the the commission to us the international maritime level to represent but also to the initiative to take
they would the up the new regional organisations must promote to to start where the community already present is as in the west and south the the pacific atlantic
with the view the the laid restructuring like i explicitly questions that there a unity for strong migrant types the up also the commission has the the need of achieved and has a number specific regulations for this types up especially at the under cheap flag nonmobile vessels a practice the to inexplicable reasons still more increasing
rest i again my support to express the the excellent report the the rapporteur
mr the president i like the rapporteur and the commissioner thank
the regional organisations and the participation remind the the community are the large important
this organisations cover almost all planet and forms a means for a active conservation and management the the resources
on this valuable resource like i the here have
we are now already for a tibets the resources the the fisheries in a crisis 
we have to make with overfishing pollution the our seas climate as we currently see the the conference in den hague and the change the the course environment the this promises resources under still greater pressure
a reform the the common fisheries is need but the is that the that we the right reforms changes
in scotland are the scottish  and the world nature fund met to the concept the  regional management for to to
this the in that all groups within a certain region be involved the a plan for the management the the resources
although the recommendations initially only a  nature will have hopes the that the project are efficiency will proof and in the during the the time a  will to
this development to a regionalisation the the common fisheries will the crucial important are to action the local level the the on to to
regional organisations play a role the international level regional or  management can the global the local level to
that will only really contribute to sustainable fisheries
mr the president i i but a minute to my support to express the the excellent report the mr salvador jové the rapporteur deals the the appropriate way a part the the common fisheries that within the union not the recognition enjoys the the deserves
the european countries bite the such the in the  the the community waters that they in the practice the global dimension the the fisheries from the view lose both what the conservation the the resources and the production if what the markets and the nature the the fleets the
certain countries the the union example the here by i represented galicia suffering strong under this situation and the the arising lack the human and material resources the the european commission to the common policy in the framework the the regional organisations the implement to to
the rapporteur inauguration rightly criticism from the this deficiencies he the same very suitable solutions for the we support support
the the mr the president mr the commissioner the resources situation on very the world in a worrying situation
that know we now all a the the reasons this is as we just have heard the  environmental by example accidents with  the the last time not the suit were
the most reason is however the exploitation the the resources the result the the excessive large  the the fleets
if we the important the the environment and also the important the the fishermen want defend must we to to sustainable exploitation the the 
before this objective can be achieved must the community however still few important steps to
this have we however not already to many time more
in its communication the the council and the parliament the the commission the lack the uniform regulations for the fishing within and outside the exclusive fishing the the denounce
the high sea applies always still the right the the law
this right is based the the changes principle the the right the freedom
the sea know not borders
almost not few fish has a fixed residence
i think the especially the the migrant resources
if somewhere overfishing place is a  to how stages the the equitable also deals the will all nothing type if others their economic interests by burdens and fits defend and the commandment the the protection the the resources with being act
on the whole as is the eu fourth the the place what the  the
this important position its the eu however not the right only for the measures to take this measures must conform with its international obligations
because this problem crosses is is international cooperation is to the most bodies the this area the and the up we the the basis for this cooperation the properly however with particularly the regional organisations
this are not only important become since the agreement the new york the but are principle the best in the responsible fishing to promote
only they have the possibility  regulations to to to and the to apply the the local circumstances
they apply statistical programme programmes to and are responsible for inspection and 
they are the most efficient if ensure must be the the respect the the rules
given the large importance the the regional organisations for a sustainable fisheries is the according i essential the eu a place to give in any regional organisation
than will last all one line draw
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes day will i leave to a the the regional organisations and the in longer where i if observer the this parliament behalf the commission fisheries present will are the does i particularly pleased that i here still part can take the the debate on the excellent report the our mr salvador jové that the position the our commission very clear voices
we support the regional organisations and we questions that there more regional organisations to and that the commission the a important role plays
when we the have on more organisations than mean we the south the the atlantic atlantic or the south the the pacific atlantic as here was said and that the commission here the initiative can take
i believe that the future the the fisheries in international waters depends the this organisations and the commission mr the commissioner can the this impossible to many working
to the position the the united nations to defend the regard the both the treaty the if the agreement the new york where here just to was referred must we active present are in this organisations to responsible  to promote
you can count the the support the the commission fisheries the this parliament also for the as here was said necessary additional material and human resources
we are the budgetary and i believe that we footing the document must the because there the in this organisations and in this waters many the the stake for the future the the fisheries in the next years
i like therefore stress that there in the european parliament essentially agreement there and that the commission therefore must know that we allies are in this constructive fight so they a greater weight in the scale can to and as was said more officials the
the is clear that the representation the the european union in compared with other countries low is mr fischler
further like i you say that we our strategy will continue to you the advance in our commission to let tell what the commission exactly will defend
same will we do with the fishing so we a fully picture to after end will you in our commission must back to responsibility the to to
to finally mr the president like i our rapporteur the mr jové again congratulate with are excellent report
to to start would i the report that we here discuss with assent want welcome the management the control and the conservation the the resources forms where you also look a large problem
we are us this all in the european union and outside aware the aware
the is also a source the large disagreement between one the fishermen and hand the scientists
if politicians are we us in certain sense between two blue
we are not fishermen and also not scientists and we try a balance and the truth to find between what the both groups us tell
this is a extremely complex situation which we a way must find
i would the parliament and the commissioner want say that we information need have according the highest standards and the the highest quality the we all can accept or we now scientists fisherman or politician are
therefore think i that there for the commission a large role is play to the fishermen far to to that they with its work and a solution find the we all can accept
the commission would account must the with the position the the national and regional bodies and the the sector
moreover was the commissioner when he previous month the my report responded geographical what in the they to are he was not or he to scotland ireland or northern was
i discovery suddenly that he to scotland and to the irish republic was but not to northern
hope will he there in the future geographical about better for are
i know that he know where northern is and i hope that he in the future the fishermen there will to visits
to finally still this i think that we us all aware are the the situation the us in december to wait the the the the the the total permitted fishing and the quotas
we must this affairs the a better way and the a debates time the the year deal with a longer preparation and more cooperation than in the past the case was
must i the commission ask to here note the to take
mr the president gentlemen members i like you first you thank for your support the our efforts to promotion and strengthening the the activities the the community in the regional organisations
i am the with already those agree the said that we more regional organisations need have i part the opinion the the mr varela and others that in this regional organisations the commission a appropriate role must play
i am the further with the parliament agree that control a cornerstone must are the the fisheries
i must here however again with urge the the position the the commission point we they not the only the the responsibility for the control in the regional organisations the the must take
the are the member the the also accordance our fundamental structure in the european union the in first body for the control must ensure
if  have they sovereign rights and the the exercise of must they the necessary resources both human if financial and material resources the available to so the community can meet the its international obligations
the commission remains therefore the the conclusion in its communication according what the nafo what the  the a exception the the rule is but not rule must be
the commission must the focus the its own task they must ensure for control the and coordination the the transposition by the member the the measures in the regional organisations
also has the commission also still a many other tasks in the with the negotiations the in the framework the the regional organisations must be held
the would not appropriate are if the the many institutional practice in the community with the to the supervise for in full sea  boats addition the the would to
i like here two very important points in remind to
the community must the first consistent action the does there not to or the now to  in the community waters is or to  in full sea
the second must the positions the the for this issues its conform with the positions the the in the framework the the current discussions on the socalled core the the commission its therefore is the discussion on measures further than the area the the regional organisations
we must a comprehensive procedure choose which with all fishing the the community account the taken with both the fishing in the community waters if the in full sea
if we together want give on our tasks if commission the the area the the control within and outside the community waters seems the i good that to do in the context the the preparation the the reform the the common fisheries
that means that we next year many occasions to to this issue close to discuss
that was what i wanted say on the goes the the report
i like however like still a few comments make on few other issues
what the duration the the transposition the the decisions the the regional organisations the am i the with you agree that the balance the the commission improve can and must be
we could to now to although only progress make but here must we us with particularly working for a better planning the the time
what the issue the the offences and sanctions the like i that point that the commission the there always for commitment sanctions in the mechanisms the to take
without sanctions the the control simply not worked the the these
unfortunately are we there however to now to not in managed such plans hard to make because the council there always against was
we will however try in the framework the the current work for the creating the a area the freedom safety and justice what during the summit the tampere a decision was taken also the this issue progress to make
than like i still briefly like the the in paragraph expressed accusation this the that the commission the parliament the the process the the community participation the the different regional organisations like out
i must you say that this absolutely not true
earlier is the opposite where the commission has the always for cooperation between the parliament and the commission expressed and has the also always taken the the rules the the interinstitutional agreement
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
pork com
the the item is the report on the the mr garot behalf the commission agriculture and rural on the proposal for a regulation the the council to amendment the regulation eec no on a common planning the markets in the sector pork com c cns
mr the president i i same problem if the mr nicholson but than in still shall extent
i was here the the indicated time for the asem  and had the that the debate already was closed
probably were few members present been which the debate was early and were still more members to late for their debate
i know not how we this problem can solve but i apologise my apology the the parliament the for the fact that i there not was when i here had are
i know not how we this problem in the future can tackle
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes we must evening discuss on the situation the the pig and the com this the not good calculated was to are the the most recent crisis
between and is the production namely the fact beaten with a increase the million overboard to a annual level to achieve the million are pigs in the european union
we have the a prices the had with a number often intolerable consequences for the producers in the particularly for the young sourced and those the the may in the debt are
once bankrupt is there for some sourced nothing otherwise the than the social status to change and simply in bringing to to the cooperatives or private companies while they the their old companies continue are
and mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes that is not the picture the the european agricultural model which the union recognition like to the the international stage
in the light the the objectives the the amended regulation no must here course the observation be done that the resources the the com the the sector pork to know private storage and refunds  and inadequate are the private storage the the operators more to less interested as this in force the the in a context the structural crisis and the refunds the although their usefulness have but the depend the the international agreements which they still more be limited
there must therefore new instruments to be however to the to protect against any serious crisis the again would can arise despite a very high level the home consumption and a good use the export
the continuing areas the the  generating namely now already a growth the the supply and if this by would to with a unlimited enlargement the the production would this again inevitably a important lack the balance the the market from resulting
well and that has the last crisis us learnt the restoration the the markets is more to less quickly to the as the specialised  for the majority its production in large lines use  the better times
best mr programmes in this circumstances the the problem not much the future the the production if the the future the the producers
therefore is the absolutely necessary the union to for the flexible instruments to crises in the pig to can prevent and control
the commission the us what this the for to a new tool the to take in the com the 
the idea is certainly good but since the apply that for producers and member voluntary is and because there if supporting a freeze the the production called the offers the proposal in a  not suitable solution for the sourced and has the end little to offer
in are current form would the very probably nothing type
therefore has the commission agriculture and rural the aware the the seriousness the the problem the basis the my report amendments tabled to this proposal attractive and more to make
in the before case is there there the the can do the reliable how on the market through a good knowledge the the production the up the  in all member with community support for the up of so any  in the union breeder or  the this wishes part to take that also can do provided he the compulsory are production for five year to stabilise further is the to cofinancing the this funds by the sourced or their groups and by the european union order the accession the the producers to encourage the introduce the differentiation in the by this funds firms sums during crisis and end the force the the member to together with the commission the most suitable measures to take for the restoration the the balance the the markets in case the serious crisis
there the agreed that the this attempt to restoration the the market account taken must be with the developments the the production in any member and that the burden must be passed the the sourced the not member are the the 
mr the commissioner best mr programmes this are therefore the solutions the the commission agriculture by
what us the are we that convinced that they the this nature are that they crises in the pig can prevent than the control if this the again arise
as can we by means the flexible and complementary and therefore not from the other disposal instruments and the that must we say the also against a acceptable price for the union the future for our sourced less problematic make
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues if shadow for the  on the common organisation for pork like i here again expressly the  the this in the commission agriculture and rural approved report to the to
the report provides with particularly in the up the a  for  and is the further than the proposal the the commission
behalf our group i i for tomorrow to a separate vote asked this i personally against the idea the a  for  am
i i not few effort to yes to say against a  for the  but i say no against a note less with european money financed  for 
i i have we not need the still more regulations and way
the is now once a accompany the the free market that question and supply the other be between by means the the price
the true indeed that the  faced are with a historic 
this was there however a stage the stable economic circumstances
the relatively low supply that the result was the the fever and the  one and the high exports to third countries hand led when to a positive  our farmers insist there fact also time again the the that the authorities the there outside the
this is a good at to this result the to give
i i are hysterical reactions now from den because
in each good  is there the two traditional 
what we in the last three year have seen is a part the the traditional  also if the extent this time what its was
the  is now once a the the few predominantly the in large extent outside the being by the authorities is has
the  in my country are the very in their 
the up the a  will however considerably more shipping to behind the concentration in the european  because the risk the relatively extensive capital will be transferred the the common fund
i give i the certainly aware the the fact that the  in europe strong major in the federal german system in germany have we a other philosophy than in the more centralised french system
the idea the cofinancing by the eu i i resolutely the the hand
i i also greater way the the hand
i would say european legislation so if need but as little if possible
what to we namely do if new  wish in example the 
we can not time again a  to ensure than is the end find
in place of would the better are if any  are own reserves was
any  would are own  must ensure that is my wish
mr the president the proposal the the commission recognises that the market for pork in the european union subject is the cyclical movements with periods the a balanced supply and satisfactory prices the followed be by periods with a large supply which the prices collapse
the periods the crisis be still more
the last crisis caused between central and beginning a prices the more than
the result of is that family are disappeared because they for the choice were to their company to the or on to steps the what integrated production the mentioned the lose the  are independence and the integrated in a  slaughterhouse supermarkets the their in exchange for a certain stability  impose
we have us even wonder or the cyclical crisis the the market not the result is the speculative interference by the mentioned globalising the as the for the their own important the sector in their over to
the commission recognises that the two only measures to the market to support namely private storage and refunds not enough to the crisis to combat
nevertheless is they with a diffidently and ineffective proposal that the characterised by a lack the vision and ambition
more than the a measure to the incomes the the producers safe to to seems the the a paternalistic opinion is you however saving during  years so you during the meagre years the head over water can the
what in the proposal a  the mentioned is that the that the member the this wishes a fund can up that by the producers the financed the participation is the voluntary basis and for a period the least five year during what the producer the to regard are herd not from to extend
the contribution the the community budget is taxable and the commission limited the to to in the committee the management the  and  the to to
the fact that the to a voluntary system is means that the efforts to the production to control the the shoulders the some is to rest while the rest the effect that objectives can make by unlimited to produce to the next crisis the leeway
the text the the commission is according us therefore disappointing and unacceptable
the problem the the cyclical imbalance the the sector the not tackled the principle the financial solidarity the the cap the broken the is the the to renationalisation and distorts the competition
we support therefore the report the our socialist coordinator the mr  garot and the in the commission agriculture approved amendments
this change the proposal in something very otherwise by the first the measure for the member a yield nature to give the second community cofinancing the the fund in to to and a contribution in the form the digressive support to the funds the to launch the third participation the the commission the the measures for the crisis and the fourth the enlargement the the scope the the measure to the  and integrated companies
also the out the the need to the up the  to promote because the number of the the member to member strong divided
the by the commission agriculture approved amendments forms for the socialists a acceptable framework for the up the the proposed funds and we would the commission want ask to its proposal in to draw if they not prepared is this amendments on to take because in are current form deserves the proposal both our our if the the the sector
the da mr the president mr the commissioner to to start thank i the mr garot for are report although i the with the content that not agree am
that there a crisis in the pig is been suggestion i not but i can not agree with the by the mr garot proposed solution for future crises
the pig has namely if only sector in the current situation partnership without already to many interference as  and private  that must as continue
the  that the mr garot in are report proposed will with eu the small producers perhaps the short term the good to and will they artificial in life the the detriment the the large and more productive producers the however the future are for the  in europe
the additional eu the the mr garot in are report proposed goes in my view in against each healthy sense which we now with agenda and the next enlargement the the union with the countries in central and eastern the agricultural want reform
the seek we not new aid because this is moreover in the budget not money for
i would like the the commission want hear in what this proposal does with the trade with the wto and agenda
the up the national funds is to my opinion matter in fight with the common agricultural because the will lead to unfair competition under the european 
also and that is still worse can the the give to the renationalisation the the agricultural
therefore i i a call to the members to against the  and the proposal the the commission to vote so the liberal vision the to still to in the pig strongly can continue there
the the mr the president mr the commissioner as see you but again what you all the common market can make
i congratulate the rapporteur
if all common market as  were up if what in the report the the mr garot the proposed or if all market meet would to the the small holdings the what the mr busk just the the denounce proposed the had we otherwise structured holdings in europe had
with the current market has the the  earlier in the hand work than blocked
the is interesting the to to how the fronts the can reverse
those the as i earlier against the traditional market are give support the this proposal
mrs keppelhoffwiechert other the the with all force opposition against withdrawn the other market or against introduction the cofinancing in this market says now that cofinancing here from den because is
if we the here proposed cofinancing the would introduce in other market for example sugar where the parliament the own opposition against any possible amendment would suddenly large sums money spoke
the mr busk makes the obviously ensure on the fact that the wto this perhaps not will accept apparently is he the the  a very other opinion agree
the must we precisely the the wto defend
this proposal is less or more same if the americans have done we to a insurance in and can the certainly hard make that social aspects the a role play
what the rapporteur here the table has the is a firstrate the that what the with administration can do if the a specific objective for view has and that objective is here clear indicated
you mrs keppelhoffwiechert you not message the this objective
that must you than however also say because on can the the opinion differences
i i the a message the this objective and again if we this in other market had included had we now a very other structure had
than now still something on the cofinancing and the involvement the the european bodies the commission has proposed the now existing market from to extend with a insurance provided this only with money the the companies the financed
what for a proposal is that in so
you can that withdraw and than the you the the the other also that can you than withdraw because that namely the concentration has promoted
if the something does must the that do as the mr garot that proposed
he has from the bad proposal the the commission a sensible  proposal made which the structure the guarantee therefore will our group for this proposal vote and i hope the i that here tomorrow a majority for will be found
i am however the very hear mr garot what the european level the the decisionmaking in the council from the bus will to
i believe not that the proposal opportunity the succeed has
precisely because the the objective the pursued that i just from the before i done will the probably the table be aside unless the french presidency still something otherwise behind the hand has that the can offer to are sense by to to
therefore will the probably a preserved funeral be but the highest interesting
the the mr the president the change the market has always many being in earth the the decisionmaking on must the the  measures for question and supply as see in to  that the production and in this case the production the pork the income the the farmers guarantee
there is opposition against the report not everyone feels here what for
the is however also with demands the the fact the further to than the report in the beef and  are because different things not in the consider
the recent know become cases the bse will lead to a  the everything what there to now to happened is in the shadow will to
the globalisation the the economy that in this case a fall to are this has at nothing from to are with cyclical crises
slaughterhouse the here by europe across transported with aid be herds built and hand large  built
this offers also this report not  solution this is many more need
the report trying however the on the the  and through the up the  the production to pool
this is a honest and credible to and therefore will i my group recommend this report not to reject
the fr mr the president the the at that the safety the our food more than ever topical is and especially the the at that the whole meat in europe affected the by the bse is the extremely important that the amendment the the com for pork immediately the adopted
the  know cyclical fluctuations join the the economists but the crisis the was the a duration and extent without unprecedented what led has to a strong increase the this phenomenon that any time many family to a bankruptcy brings and that any time the to the concentrate and into the the industry
this crisis has very clear demonstrated that the current very weak mechanisms the the com for pork inadequate are and that must be for in a  that the stabilise the the incomes the the producers possible makes thanks a system the taxation in a period the positive situation and the benefits in a  short as the european commission proposed to the example the the french  system
but this proposal would completely inadequate are if the the member the possibility would offer this  to refuse and if the the only the the producers would leave to with their contribute the reserves to forms to the income in a  to support the would the a  see the the the happening with two different speeds
the the one on would the the producers or those the properly to integrated companies the taking the the this supply they would the prefer give the systems which they already have individual savings  
they would not few obligation to  the the need to take and their right the growth retain
they would as itself the cause are the the next  the inevitably the bankrupt the the  would cause
the the other on would the smallest producers the family the stake the solidarity slating accept to their production to to and contribute the a national  that them the the next  in are bankruptcy would persuaded
the current com for pork is extremely weak and many to modest
this the little upheaval the amendment is the first the the commission proposed since
the amendments the our commission agriculture the initiative the  garot whose work i very respect change this modest text in a text the consultation
the changes the our commission has made are namely the large important
the participation the all member the this new system will compulsory be the
any  where than also in the union will can  the this supply
that the community budget involved the involved is also essential because without that would those the member be the a the this  in fact only but obligations have and would the system total not because have
the efforts can not only the the on the the producers to
therefore like our rapporteur a greater involvement the the union in the form the a cofinancing the the 
in place the the the way a system to create that a exception is the the international practice is the precisely through this flexible system for prevention and control the crises and against a reasonable price closer the that what there in certain third countries as the  that the force is in the united states and in canada
we support therefore the proposal the the commission as that completely is amended by the work the our commission agriculture and we vote for adoption the the 
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen ladies and gentlemen late i the from the the clear make that i in principle baringdorfs with the proposal the the commission to institution the a  i think the with particularly also the the austrian agriculture
this fund can a suitable instrument are to the lose the sourced in  within certain limit to the
especially the crisis the the pig the and has demonstrated that the instruments the the current organisation as private storage and export not enough
if we in the future such crises want prevent or control seems i the under proposal this the first step
a another important point which the commission in its document however not reference makes the the cofinancing
i i must also the the com for pork the fundamental principle the community financing the application are
this assures us because the intensive participation the the farmers and the us indirectly in the a services to achieve
in the proposal the that the member this fund must up
i i must the ensure ensure that all member that do so all farmers in europe same opportunities to participation have
the the management the the fund must the authorities however so possible the forgive make the member must the fund approve and control but not itself manage
that must they the the  leave the farmers must however from own free like can decisions or they this participate but if a farmer decision part to take must he the set for five year
i am that convinced that with this instruments the stability the the market can be improve the farmers in europe to the the opportunity  repeated crises the head to offer
mr the president mr the commissioner rapporteur garot has the proposal the the commission on funds for the  commerce dealt and good hypotheses
the attempts to a regulation in to to the for balance can ensure between the production and the market are in the joint important the both the chain if the everyone
i like however stress that we in this stage the the  not  must make
i am the carefully with mr busk agree that we us now the the enlargement to the east must prepare in a situation which we within few years the whole agricultural must review is the to my opinion not sensible a sector to a  to to forms
here are north and south very clear the other in the south is the more for a common financing while the northern  there the from is that they in very large extent the voluntary based must are
the basis the voluntary can the regulations to up which as mrs schierhuber here just said the  all in europe can participate
the community can than especially in technical sense finance the the the the to the technical affairs and the the way help the the the the to the the regulation
to my opinion are voluntary funds in the future also in the  a guarantee for stable markets
mr the president the would wrong are if we here were has to this proposal the to break or the commission to criticise for the fact that they the has tabled
i like the rapporteur for are report thank
the is least during the eleven year that i member am the this parliament the first time that we a debate to on the problems the the sourced all in the european union hallmarks
i say not that the good is or that i the agree agree am but the is good that we for the first a positive debate the this subject turn
the there not doubt that the sourced where you you also presented or too a disastrous period behind the back have
i i family bankrupt see to i i listened to experiencing the not knew how they the problems the the sector hallmarks had survive
now i i myself the next simple question will this proposal there the short or long term to contribute to their problems to effects
i doubt strong that this proposal the sourced the the short or long term can help
cofinancing is one thing but i fear that this the competitiveness in many countries the the european union would 
i like the commission however questions the because that is where the for some under us perhaps the comes the or the proposal for the member a yield nature will to
if the in all member the carried than is is the there honest the to
the the however not in all member carried than is that not honest
than will the suspicion the it the to that producers in other member unfair benefits enjoy
can the commissioner this answers
or i for or against voice depends namely the the are answer
unfair competition must to any price be avoid
the prices the pork have always enormous  and fall experienced as mrs keppelhoffwiechert has said
in times the high prices was the the producers for the when
were the prices low than were families in the problems
the is a issue the balance
this is the problem where the  the this at that question
is the commissioner this problems also tackle in the  the  the tomatoes and other sectors if the in the future with specific problems to camps to
we must us ask or the common agricultural the current problems the the head can offer
the policy is the itself good and i support the but the must however first back to the 
we must the still agree good look
there must a new  place and we must more work to to see how we to a really proposal can to we can not the producers the the already difficult enough have questions to to pay for something that they the not can afford
let we agree look how we the sector the best the longer term can support
president the his the this debate is however the that to the is what you the can regulate in common agricultural and what not
in the sense is the a momentous evening with particularly what the the green group
i i good understand that the a organisation like for the intensive enhancement and dismantling the the agricultural as the  is  production
that the form the agriculture have we for the future recognised if the most sustainable environmentallyfriendly form the agriculture
the the is that remarkable
in future discussions with the green group will we this certainly the back
i like first the rapporteur the mr garot congratulate with the fact that he a effort effort has done to to look or he something can do the the at that the  in a crisis is
that the the is a compliment worth
the second is are medicine the right medicine
on i i large doubts
in that medicine believe i honest said not i will you also tell why
i think that a organisation only sense has when you is talk with cofinancing european financing and if you also agreements makes with the to the amount the you produces
if you that not does than is the risk large that you although the market or the incomes  but especially in descending something and that can not the intention are
in that case course i however for a free market for the  which the market end rules how the price the development
i would than if we choose for a organisation and strengthening the the policy the would choose for the better elements the  so they more in the market are a market the the the finish still further  and a still greater position the
you can you ask in what the country and horticulture in europe this a good answer the can find
i course in that case would for strengthening the groups with particularly to a better dominant to to and to better agreements to make
in the sense must i however say that i to a other conclusion come than mr garot and that i also the proposal yes i would almost can say this can i the almost that agreement to as that before but we must also honest are that the in being for the problem fact nothing for
president that is the approach the i however the would want choose which i again the medicine that the mr garot by reject but the large appreciation i for the effort effort the he done has to however to look or there a possibility is to something more social support to to in the 
mr the president ladies and gentlemen first like i you mr garot the i thank for your excellent report on the institution the a  in the common organisation for pork
the point for the proposal the the commission was the crisis in the pig the we now thank have overcome
we are we us currently fortunately again in a economic positive stage the the  the characterised the by less supply and clear better prices for the sourced
already many months are the production the or euro per kg and according experts are the perspectives good
from the development that therefore that the  still still the force is still still applies and that the bad times good times will follow
this fact should we in the debate on the under proposal not from the view lose
we discuss on a instrument for income the producers in where
we speak not on a new organisation for pork
the organisation is there already and the would wrong are this in principle good working organisation the the again to to
in the discuss the the in the report included amendments like i my attention in first body focus the the points the the clear remove the the proposal
the first point the the cofinancing
that is to the a certain informed doubt the  in the discussion on this proposal of is also in the amendments and there
i must the however clear make that the responsibility for the  and the the  level the the  itself is
the  decide on the  and the indirectly and automatically also on the prices
therefore would the according i wrong are the producers the their responsibility to people
also brings the cofinancing the risk with the that that the signals the the market less clear the the producer arrive
i am the there therefore not that agree that cofinancing need is to a  pricing to can to
if we a  pricing would to would we the  in the hundred send
a thing i i today however the learnt obviously are there members the like would see that we now in all market cofinancing would introduce
if we indeed in all market cofinancing would into would we probably the  not out but this is the in fact in this debate not to if i the good i understand
the second important issue is the voluntary nature the the system
the proposal late the member the choice they can as they that want a fund up
we should the however not forget that the european  the country to country strong from also terms organisation also the cooperation between the different phases the the chain is very fates organised
therefore are there many member but also many  in this member the a  the advance the the hand point according them is this not need the because they other resources have to during a reached in the cycle their income safe to to
certain countries insist however absolutely the the a  and i must you in all honesty confess that if we now a  compulsory prescriptive we this whole matter the the our community can write this would in the council never a majority be found
than like i now still something say on the into the the specialised  in the proposed system this the in the amendments and the
according i will that very what being in earth have this a the  very  process and b the in this  not per necessarily need is support to to the  sourced must be supported
also varies the weight the  strong this is the to kg
therefore is the i i here many better the economic balance between the  and the  by the market itself and not with through the artificial measures to let determine
we should also especially not forget that in many countries the sourced the by their produced  itself refers and the through their terrorised  directly access have to the 
amendment is for the commission not acceptable this amendment lead to a drastic action in the  the the farmers
farmers must outside the  can continue if they their freedom want retain also be the measures not further described and therefore is the decision on the to to apply measures mainly a matter for the member
that would however only real  are and this am i the absolutely not agree
the laid  already to according the member and already to according the previous production is worrying close in the near the a regulation the would also a enormous bureaucratic tape the also with the view the the control
according the commission is the the certainly justified only the farmers the to the  join the a regulation to issues
this to because if supporting a certain  while others the not join this guarantee not have apart the this four key the during the debate on this report the the item were the are there still few other amendments the the less principle nature are
the is with particularly there the details the the regulation this details hear i i however not home in the regulation the the council but in the implementing
what the  the the support basis the the number animals the must i that point that this in the proposal already a legal there
late i to finally still briefly something say on a issue that especially in amendment the there the the namely the improvement the the statistical information on the development the the  and the  for the 
according i are here not new laws and nor new rules necessary
rather is a correct and comprehensive application the the already available having rules by the member and their statistical services necessary
my services have the mr programmes the eurostat the for the implementation the this statistical into responsible are already the the existing problems out and the the a improvement the the results
in the last months have we on several discussions held during what very clear is has that there not lack the rules is the evil is rather that the existing rules not sufficient seriously be taken the collection the data on the  not always correctly shortcomings and nor the questions the the member always faith be answered
you can from my comments made that i the by you tabled amendments not can accept
i am however the very grateful for this debate and i hope that the be possible will are the on the the proposal in the council new with incapable to we i must namely in all honesty confess that the opinions the the member this far major and this problem the problem
the the mr the president must i a question the the commissioner to i am namely a little irritated
the commissioner has said that the commission absolutely not the plan is the common organisation for pork to change
the title here reads however on the proposal for a regulation the the council on amendment the regulation eec no on a common planning the markets in the sector pork
what has the commission than in so the us presented
if you not as far you to in this amendment good this is on to talk but if you at nothing you change true the text not
perhaps can you that still agree up
if you with proposals the the fact is is the parliament as free amendments in to must
that is us good right
mr the president i will try that the to legacy
i i not said that with the adoption the this proposal the organisation for pigs not would be amended
course is this a amendment the the organisation for pigs that the outside doubt
by a number during this debate concerns opinions was however the impression raised that now a organisation for pigs must be introduced therefore am i as free been that to point that we already a such organisation have
thank you mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to at closed
presentation the the annual the the court
the the item is the presentation the the annual the the court for the year
i thank the president the the court the mr karlsson for are presence and give him immediately the floor
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen behalf the members the the court like i you all thank for your invitation to here the e annual the the court to present
just if in previous years ever this presentation the start the the discharge for the year
the report has same structure if in the last two year with chapters for the revenue in each the the under the categories the the financial perspectives areas categories
there is also a chapter devoted the the assurance the comments the the court on the implementation the the sixth seventh and eighth european development are if annex the the annual our
in the different chapters the the annual be four important issues discussed
the first is there a analysis the the application the the budgetary  within the specific financial categories
you will see that the court account bearing with ask the the parliament more attention has spent the the result that is given the previous comments
in each the the chapters does the court report the the progress the are made the a number areas which they in the past report has issued in my presentation will i the few the this issues back
the third has the court in answer the the request the the european parliament its controls with the to the assurance extended we provide now additional information per  in each chapter
to finally presenting the court in each the the chapters a number other important 
on many the this findings the length report done in the special reports the the court
since the last discharge has the court special reports up with the results the the controls the at were the a large number specific areas which the financial management the the community for improvement room is
although this reports now not the the item are must there the account that be taken in the discharge
the total revenue for the year total billion euro
the resources the basis the the gross national product represent the this total
the resources the basis the the vat represent and the traditional own resources forms the the total
the remaining there from the surplus the the previous year and other income
this means that  the the resources the the community the resources the basis the the gnp and the vat the calculated and the with through the statistical data
in this context like i two important comments the the court under your attention to
in the first place has the court now already few years comments placed the the use the a statistical cumulatively system esa that for all other purposes already is replace by a newer system esa
 is year
also has the court in the framework the the fight the vat a method indicated the based is the a compared between tax and statistical data on interim consumption this can especially useful are for areas where the risk the tax fraud very high is
the member the to the reason asked application the this method to consider
the the area the the customs makes the court in its report reference the the complexity and the europe application the the regulation on passive processing
the court supports however also the proposal the the commission to the  with a economic effect to modernise
with the to the expenditure in was a total amount the billion euro the new implementation and a amount the billion euro the payments made
that is respectively and the the available appropriations for the year
the rate the the rate sums in the financial perspectives is respectively and
the expenditure in the framework the the budget are on many different areas distribution
therefore is the difficult to general conclusions to draw on the implementation the the budget
the court the however the next points the
the half the the expenditure the are made under the common agricultural
as in chapter the the annual the described the this high rate namely almost the the final appropriations the partly declared by the many transfers this the in fact the that the original estimates the both the revenue if the expenditure highest its were
the court request the commission and the member the quality the this estimates to improve
there were also many the transfers for the structural place the the structure the the budget significantly 
also were there large differences between the sums for the programmes and the sums the in the financial perspectives were allocated the majority the the measures in the framework the the structural had again programmed be
the this area was also there the a underimplementation the commitment and appropriations and the a large number operations the the end the the year
the areas where the programmes the the community directly by the commission be carried as the internal policy and external measures are the  something lower
also here is there the a large number implementation and payments the the end the the year
the next years will we here certainly the back to
the court again therefore the comments the the last years on the negative consequences of as haste and want decisions heavy workload with a greater opportunity the mistakes etc
finally the the court in both chapters on internal policy and external measures the that the comments the the commission itself on implementation the the budget not adequate are
the court is therefore welcome with the clear commitment in the answer the the commission to its budgetary and true report fundamental to improve
the court has from the year annual a statement the reliability up
each year has the court serious criticism expressed the the legality and financial the the payments and the underlying operations
this is now again the case
the control the the payments in additional also now again a unacceptable high number mistakes see that the had the the amount the reality or the  the the underlying operations
the majority the this mistakes was the for the areas the the community budget the be managed by authorities in the member
the was often to cases which not met was the the criteria for  to high  inadequate provided and 
also are there cases which not is met the the rules or which there is the shortcomings in the systems the effect of the payments can not directly be the but this increase the the opportunity the mistakes
the most frequent examples of are not introduction the controls the the rules problems with detailed support documentation and the not correctly failure the giveaway
therefore has the court for not the necessary proof obtained from its controls to to can assure that the underlying operations only and regular were except what the the own resources the obligations and the costs
hand the the court for the sixth seventh and eighth european development a positive assurance
not only is the the task the the court report to do the the mistakes the found are the its controls but we must there also for ensure that the  precisely interpreted and used be
therefore like i the members that point that the large number by the court the mistakes not given can and must be if a indication the the  in the budget
the most by the court at  to continue from a inadequacy financial management and inadequate control and only in the case the a small part the the found mistakes is there reason for further research by olaf or the this competent bodies in the member
a another risk the a wrong interpretation is that the objectives for redress measures be the with the view the the reduction the the number mistakes and the obtain the a positive assurance
as the court already in previous reports clear has made requires a improvement the medium term a combination the general and specific measures including the clarification and improvement the procedures in the particularly in the member
in this the welcomes the court the plan to the the commission for improvement the the financial management that they in the framework the the discharge the has presented the the for discharge competent authority
in the this like i few comments make on the reform the the commission
the court is pleased on the efforts the the prodi to a modern and sound administration and  the established to to and same special attention to give the the way which political priorities be the and resources be allocated
many shortcomings the the commission now like tackle are by the court already the many occasions stressed
i mention example the proposals the the commission to the responsibility the the authorising to increase for the implementation the obligations and payments and a end to make the the centralised system the previous approval for operations by the financial controller together with the up the a independent internal audit vote this proposals line with the main requirements for a improve financial management the we in us opinion no have formulated
a another part the the reform that closely with the a by the court indicated  is the greater emphasis the the the the the levels the results and performance within a framework the allocation the resources with ex the priorities and objectives the clear defined and measurable are
the commission has now amid per  announced the can be given if a response the the bottlenecks which the court already many years long has out i mention here if example the proposals for improvement the the management the programmes for external aid
this initiative is clear based the a analysis the many agreements some with the analysis the the court length has explained in its annual
the court line the commission the to its reform as quickly possible by to to a large part the the reform there namely to far only still but the paper
the introduction the this new reform asking to a real change the the culture the the commission a process that very certainly time will require
the reporting in the annual on the followup the previous comments late see how difficult the for the commission is to the necessary changes what is decided by to to
in some cases as the reforms the the measures for the subsidised use the  and  or the programme the for the south as measures on some aspects the the traditional own resources has the commission measures affected to improvement to to in specific shortcomings which the court report has issued
the other areas was slow responded
what example the  the has the court noted that the overall situation hardly changed is and that the quotas in fight with the position the the court are increased with if result greater surpluses the the  and heavy financial burden in the with the storage and sale
in the case the imports the products against preferential tariffs is there according the court to far nothing done to to prevent that same offences the the legislation place if the what plenty are in the special report the the court no
the the area the the european regional development has the court comments evaluated which according its financial correction need was
only in cases was the court met on the  the the commission has taken
the the area the the social consultation has the commission not all measures affected the they had committed in its answers the the comments the the court
the the area the internal policy has the court nine contracts the dg energy and transport and eight contracts the dg research again controlled
the commission had but for three the the contracts measures affected while there for six other still measures blocks
in the annual pointed the court the a number shortcomings in the management the a fund for readjust for nicaragua and honduras
in are in published  asked the council the commission to its links with the regional bank to review and by this bank unjustified  sums back to recover
the the end the was the commission still still are with the up the a new organisation
from this and other examples that clear that the commission to far not only slow is been with the take the  but that they also in the particularly problems has the the funding the unjustified paid sums
in its programme for has the court therefore a general control planned the all  where the  the the commission a role play
as i already earlier said is the financial management the the commission only a part the the overall management the the community resources
the member are responsible for the daily management the the majority the the community resources the the area the the common agricultural and the structural
in this annual and in the special reports the since the previous discharge are published the still again the attention located the the serious and persistent shortcomings in the management and systems the the member
a important category mistakes the the the in the assurance the slip highly the subsidies by the central or local authorities
also the the area the the common agricultural request the court the member and the commission to  controls from to to by means the a comprehensive application the  the all common  as also in the integrated administration and system the case is
the dramatic events from the recent past have clear the increasing important the administration and  the the european agenda demonstrated
the would for all representatives the european institutions or the member clear must are that this a permanent change represents the the values and opinions the the european taxpayers
they expect in exchange for their confidence and contribution that the european resources the a sensible and fair way be spent
the proposed reform the the commission must given be if a constructive answer the this challenge a answer that our support deserves
the the other on will the commission aware that they high expectations has raised and compulsory is its good intentions in the practice to to and results to make
the budgetary has with success the the given to the reform and is in the the ensure the the public on the financial management the is now its task its efforts to strengthen and this reform to do success
in the practice means this that they sufficient attention and resources must to the the followup the and the response from the reform
the members the the european parliament will the a role play
the new president the the italian court the  that  the a number weeks ago officially appointed is stated the are  i am that convinced that the relations between the court and the parliament considerably be improve if the parliament the instruments strengthened which the the systematic way account can the with the results the controls the the court
i join i the are words the
they to that the that we like a further development want see the the operational organisation and the methods the the parliament they must a expression are the this need to structural change
yesterday was i in the opportunity i thank the president this with the president the the parliament to speak on the involve the all parliamentary committees the the financial control and 
my last but certainly not least important comment is that also the cooperation the the member need is
because they responsible are for the daily management the the majority the the community resources must the member their financial controls improve and the full the responsibility the the take for the fight the fraud the detriment the the budget
only if all operators commission parliament council european court and member the working for the reform and work the the implementation of will the confidence the the european taxpayers in the financing the the community restore can be
i thank the president the the court and give immediately behalf the commission the floor the mrs schreyer
mrs the president i like president karlsson sincerely thank for are presentation the the annual the the court
the report the mrs schreyer was also interesting
i like the president the the court however in the particularly thank for the way which the members the the commission control this time are informed
we have us the the this debate can prepare and did not details more from the press to know
as you already said mr karlsson was because the handover the the previous commission by the new commission a completely year
we expect not that this new commission there immediately in fails a end to make the the wrong developments and abuses the the parliament has highlighted and which we time vain the reforms have the
we welcome the as the court to that the commission the president prodi a reform adjusts the we the a constructive but critical way hand
is the with the community budget last the good on the
now the commission over a year in function is and the partly already from september for the implementation the budget responsible is is that a question the we like yes would answer
also with the last annual the the court in the hand can this question however still not to honour and conscience be answered
the court the rightly the the many steps the the commission already has the or least has announced to the situation to improve
also commissioner schreyer has towards referred
the is than to new procedures for the the the the priorities and the favour allocation the resources to changes in the policy fundamental improvements in the implementation the the budget and the financial control the reform the the programmes and the up the a efficient financial audit
this hope measures are however still all serve
the description the the reality in the annual working earlier 
the is particularly regrettable and hardly to understand that the reliability the the accounts still always deficiencies
with other words the commission has its accounts not the item the and the approved accounts reflect little the real financial situation
data on the payment the advance and the  lack the the end the the year and the existing implementation are with but as billion euro received
same be possible progress to high estimated  even says the court
the parliament has during the  for and already emphatically the this serious  mistakes out
although the difficult is and time costs to the management the the budget fundamental to change mrs the commissioner had we hoped that the new commission there least in would succeed the accounts quickly in item to make
even that is however obviously not managed and that regret i very
the your office has you us promised that you this would ensure mrs schreyer
now the the european parliament in a difficult position the in january the this year have we because still declared that if also the approval the the accounts on again with serious mistakes failure would are we that not would accept
you know the on passage from that decision the
as we in january have said can there without approval the the accounts also not discharge for the pursued financial policy be granted
the approval the the accounts is a condition for discharge
here must a solution for be found mrs schreyer and i like you than also questions or the accounts on can be corrected
the court can this year again for the sixth time the list not assurance give that like say that the court not can guarantee that the accounts regular and only to the are has
there are to many mistakes made to a such guarantee to give
the number mistakes is still always over the
worst to euros is that a amount the approximately billion euro that not correctly is spent
i am the with the president the the court agree that the mistakes not in all cases the fraud apparent
often is there there the  or misunderstandings because the complex rules and procedures but that the not way that a such error simply unacceptable is and the den duration not can be tolerated
your reference to the bad implementation in the member best mrs schreyer must i in insofar the the hand point that the court clear says where the the the commission the lacks and end is the however still always the commission the the responsibility for the implementation the the budget bears
i think than also that you more must are so we with reason against the european citizens can say that their money good the managed
we to now in our commission the the work and will closely with you work
mrs the president to to start thank i the court for the annual
i like like few problems because and hope that the mr karlsson my questions today can answer
to the the the discharge for decided the parliament not discharge to give for as the court not assurance on could make as mrs theato just dragging
i like however like know how very the with the budget the the is
yesterday proposed i you a question but i know that there little time was however would i the you a ready and clear answer want on the error
to apparently can the this difficult the
yesterday  a member the the court there during are press a figure the i think therefore that we also here a figure must can to
is the error
i hope that i a answer can to
the commission by in more than billion euro from
the commission is there however not particularly in managed this budget good to manage
the amount for investment is million to low budgeted
the commitments billion to low and the still affordable to to commitments billion to high
if the management the a private such  had made was they guaranteed by the shareholders redundancies
late us however a little water in our wine do and the words not 
the previous commission the for the budget the responsible was is because the laan issued
the new commission the this year assessed to its ability item the affairs to to and reforms by to to
i am therefore welcome that the court more important has adopted the the follow the former reports
the is because clear where there still problems are but also where improvements are made
i would like see that the annual the the court what more was
there must more figures and more facts given be
the mr karlsson said today that the difficult is figures to give
that understand i but i early a the my staff the chapter on agriculture to look and in a searching time had he a fully overview made the the countries where the problems arise the the nature the the problems and the the negligible amount
when a industrious employee the the parliament this things in a searching in card can to than must the however the the court demands that they for each chapter a such overview makes
there to course certain less score things the the light but as is there least openness
the the way can we the press the total wild responding and the each annual blood employable the mouths number
we can agree and for always say this are the problems and we want a solution find
i think that this a good method is and i think that the annual more would must are
also think i that the annual userfriendly must are and clear recommendations must do example a or two clear recommendations per chapter
the would according i also good are that the court its annual used in the year good
this would us in the parliament more time give for the discharge and we would the discharge than also not each year need from to to
if rapporteur have i now only on days to the commission questions to to and they has but days to a answer to formulate
the is not reasonable such demands to to if we the annual earlier can to would we us work the a still more way can do
i am also welcome that the court stressed that the mistakes not all to make have with fraud and i hope that the press from its local  so they know that there not only scandals are
there can also there are the irregularities or lack
the is really a relief that we apparently the good way are with the fraud
there are only little cases the olaf pointed or for criminal criminal persecution the the member passed but the is important to know that the the budget corresponds with or billion spend as mrs theato said
this amount is more than the total amount that the union the development paying to but a compared to mention
the commission like with its reform especially the individual directoratesgeneral responsible to and i like the court like questions or they becomes has for a restructuring the the annual so there the each directorategeneral a separately chapter can be devoted
i will into or the this year already possible is so we the directoratesgeneral can assess
we can also start the commissioners to assess and points to give according their achievement
this would for some perhaps a incentive are
the court stressed still agree that the daily management the the most eu example in the framework the the agricultural and the structural in the member happening i am the agree with the the that the member now but agree up must be
the member cover the in commit fraud do not few control and time if there criticism expressed the is the the the shoulders the brussels the with other words the the commission and others
i think that the member the would must shame
in was a convention on the protection the the financial interests the the union adopted
there is but one country that this convention in are own legislation has into
that is however below everything and the is high time that we the member up shake
to finally am i welcome with the cooperation in the framework the the discharge
i am that convinced that we a result will achieve but the requires openness and honesty the all parties
we if members the the parliament should there not doubt on let there that we the affairs sensible want tackle and that we in april discharge will to the condition that we the requested information been have
mrs the president also my thank the the president the the court for the report and the the commissioner for the answer this
agree to more think i that in the public opinion especially will  that there also this time not positive assurance is for the european expenditure
any know and that will also still often said be that the most money the spent by the member
therefore this must we the especially seek think i
the is also know that the the part the the expenditure agricultural are
the sentence the this parliament has the commission a number years ago set that if there irregularities are this for the member a additional financial correction would can mean the
would the not interesting are i i understand that the court that analysis would the not interesting been are if the court the effects of had analysed
would that also applied can be the the other sectors
i would that like agree want know
i am the completely agree with the mr blak that the unsatisfactory is that there in the report the the court not precise figures be mentioned
is the reliability the the expenditure now or and is the where that for the agricultural the reliability lower is
the court says still that they not sufficient staff has to that to analyse
that would as can are but if the court to a believe is than take i the that they the based the precise figures
the large question for i is why can the figures not be published
i believe also that we for agriculture a conciliation have and in the case the disputes between the commission and the financial corrections can that be presented the that conciliation
case the commission and the court this positive on yes or no
last point mrs the president this financial report is on the year
course will the commission say we were only the in september therefore the is our responsibility not
i think that that a time the must the
i think that we the the commission clear a indication must have when think the commission to can to with a positive assurance because we can that not more from year in year from postpone
president mr the president the the court gentlemen commissioner best colleagues i thank you mr the president the the court for this excellent annual
i thank you also for the followed procedure
we have more than a week the advance the affairs can been we have us good can prepare
i think that the in principle a good procedure is
only must i you honest say that i free disappointed am on the sitting the yesterday in the commission control
the was to briefly
you you fact also not did the a number precise and however the crucial questions the the colleagues you the have i think the unfortunately
a number questions are today already in the debate back and today read i in the süddeutsche zeitung that colleagues the you the detailed statements make
they have the on fraud irregularities mistakes the to eight billion german mark sums
i read also that the wrong percentage the more than is
why keep we the that figure
the mr mulder has the done and also the rapporteur
we want that know because the the important is in our balance
we have earlier political statements on done
i would you therefore want ask to this again the to answers
we to the that there indeed the the commission very what mistake the that there still always not culture is which the money the the european taxpayers the a good way the managed
that is unfortunately
we know course all that the commission the changes working
the president the the court has this also the out and in the sense the course the report the next year the report the the truth
there is also indeed need the action in the regional and the national parliaments because the is precisely in the member that there very what mistakes done
therefore would i the colleagues in the national parliaments want call to the two conventions the still not all are ratified to ratify
i call also the ministers state and government the to the proposal to institution the a european public prosecutor in nice good to approve
finally still mr the president the the court a last request
concerned your report what readable
mention man and horse
mention the member the the good do mention also those the the bad do the some areas
the will the greater increase
the will the attention for your report increase and the will a order are to the the next time better to do
together with already my colleagues welcome i this annual that in a constructive spirit the us the presented
as must the commission and the member this report also take and the findings the use if a instrument to their performance the the area the the management the the finances to improve
the is unfortunately that the court not statement the healthy function the the commission can give in the form the a positive assurance
this situation is not changed since the first assurance on the year was published
the member are responsible for the management the the the expenditure and the court has a series mistakes discovered the the management by the member
this is quite worrying
let we not forget that the resources the the eu directly or indirectly the the european citizens from are
therefore there there a clear duty to aware the to to for any last euro the the spent
we must ensure ensure that the european citizens where for their money to
i am welcome that the commission steps has taken to the control on the management the the specialising to improve and that this systems in the member be introduced
this will the number mistakes reduce
the commission must a  attitude adopt in its to to correct management the the level the the member
we in the parliament must also vigilant are and that ensure that the commission its task effect
the commission is responsible for the out the the budget
a lack the correct administration and procedures a lack the planning practice assessments manner or abstract criteria for  are affairs the often mentioned be in this report
together with the negative assurance lead this to concerns the the taxpayers
i know that this report and the work that the parliament to do the in the with the discharge to a greater vigilance will lead with the to the spending the the resources the the community
let we therefore our task the a positive and constructive way tackle in the important the the citizens the the eu
mrs the president mr the president the the court netherlands was in the country that per head the the population the most exercising the the financial the the european union
if representative the this countries am i however what disappointed in the act the the commission
we could the the discharge on this commission the benefit the the doubt give because they was damage with a legacy the the to house does commission
the annual on is however the muddle the the current commission and unfortunately the annual lists a series shortcomings in the accounts the the commission the
serious think i the fact that the commission the apparently not bound know the the by this parliament approved budget
the commission has the first million euro more down than budgeted and the second the original budget adapted and a revised version the not by the parliament is approved carried
netherlands has in only the all subsidies received while a proportion part in the near the the would it
i wish the poorer eu a relatively greater share in the  but i think the than the additional mr that the most irregularities took in the payments the the subsidies
like would i see what member the this irregularities the most benefited have
the number irregularities in the payments the the structural justifies a carefully research to the force and effectiveness the this funds
the reform the the commission offers not guarantee that at irregularities in the future not will prevent
the commission the than also now and in the future judged the compliance the the rules
mrs the president to to start like i the mr karlsson thank for the important work that the court does and for the fact that the publication the the annual this time not is preceded by reports in the press the confidence in the work the a serious and many institution if the court and in the work that the parliament and the other institutions must do the serious undermined when people with certain intentions information let 
i welcome especially the impartiality the your report which you both the shortcomings unbundled if the made progress was as salutes you the that the commission really something within
i work together with a number other members the the reform and we have just still during a meeting with president prodi the that he personally leadership the the the up the a paper that based is the many the the recommendations the the court under the regarding presidency the the mr karlsson year in year from has done
i must say that this indeed a theoretical process is that only creation in action will into but the is the good on the
the commission follows the way the the parliament and the independent experts say
the the way are however still the only obstacles as the particularly long period the for the reform the the financial rules is for
we are the in a period the for everyone inconvenient is also for those the responsible are for the payments we have now with a old system and a new system to make and with a rather insecure period dalmatia
i welcome the than also that the court its opinion on the reform the the financial rules soon from like to
mrs the president i question i the where the council is
i believe that the council responsible is for the  part the the report the the mr karlsson and the expenditure the he approves
where is the council
i would my speech fact want interrupt to there someone the council published mrs the president
perhaps can you ensure ensure that the council the the next debate on the accounts present is and the floor the
again what i the most welcome in your report is your recognition that the commission something within the the council the with the to the expenditure not only in terms respect weight in the scale the can that not be said
you says that the court remains point the the serious and continuing shortcomings in the control and nuclearrelated the the member you says also that the majority the the mistakes the made the the large programmes which the expenditure by bodies the the member be managed
i think that we if members the in the are our own authorities the to point and the to complain if they their task not good role but you must us help by the member and the programmes clear to mention
i am there namely the convinced that a good protection the the financial interests the the community requires that bad financial management also financial consequences has that like say that this parliament resources can abstained the a member the the rules for the monitoring the the expenditure repeatedly has neglected
mr pomés ruiz the is indeed completely unacceptable that the places the the council know are
you has this very rightly the out
mrs the president i am also grateful that the council there now is because i like also still what against him say
must i first the mr karlsson thank for the fact that the cooperation with the commission control this year better was than in previous years
your work is the essential important for our task you you because the experts and we must then the political problems solve
we should not forget that this report on the budget the is on the year that the forced resignation the the commission place the is therefore clear that the now still to early is to a believe to judgement
next year can only really concluded be or the reform the the commission worked the the these start to to
the is interesting the to see that the the part the the reform the the commission is on the question who the responsibility the the the
who is responsible
where is the final responsibility
today would we must the how the commission and the member the money to in place the to assess how the court its work does
i  however that the work the the court not good enough is done to us the service to are the our task
let we not forget and i hope again that the council this also should that the the money in the member the spent
the court has just if in previous years not exactly can say where the mistakes the have occurred
we have time the time asked to a list with bygones
we want know where the problems are in what member and the what areas
we want even also know who the the good do
we read in the report that two member their work exemplary have done with the to the collection but how must other member this member if example take if they not know to what countries the is
we have names need
if the court not the spade not the the name like mention and say what countries the good and what countries the bad have done must we that for you do
your legitimacy if need will than the in doubt be drawn and some will perhaps even suggest that certain members that also are the interests the the member to protect the them if members the the court have appointed
can you us this a commitment do for the future mr karlsson because a lack the clear information in this report makes the for us very difficult to the the right areas pressure from to exercise the the worst offenders
i i also a appeal the you to a place know to make the the eu with the worst  and with the involved areas
the taxpayers the europe should however the know where their money to to is
if we the facts not know combat we fraud with one hand the the back bound
course are there not  for the improvement the the financial management the the commission
the whole process requires time
we have many established interests the we can challenge but we wait the report the next year the to to see or indeed specific proven can be that the measures the the commission from the at the introduction a actually effect have had in the form the eradication the the financial mismanagement
president the enlargement the the european union is remind and the report the the court makes clear that also in the countries still many work done must be
if that already with the current modest budgets must how must the than will if this countries really member are and that to do the the common agricultural and the the structural
my group take the than also the the the important that our rules on financial control now already be applied in the countries
the this area can we not early enough start with them now already if really full member to deal
i question than also the the court that we here in the next reports more insight in can to so we not the the day the the accession for belatedly surprises to to are
president there is the someone the the council but that is not enough because the is already a few time said in the member the most large mistakes be made
the commission control can the not longer tolerate that year in year from the impression the raised that the in between commas brussels a  is while the responsible in the capitals are
therefore mr karlsson questions we the you to more insight to give in who the good does and who there a culprits the makes
only the the way namely if the responsible be appointed can we the tackle and can we really to work the the up the europe to as the confidence the our citizens back to win
to finally that is also a important part to that confidence back to to am i here the hope from that this house for the end the the year a clear statute will have so this the last time will are that this members in a report the the court the a negative way mentioned be
to that to achieve wish i also you mrs the president many persistence to and am i my thank from for the commitment the you to now to already shown has
mrs the president also i like the court the i thank for are report and for the political explanatory the the court yesterday in the commission control has given the the opportunity was also still agree stressed that there currently a necessary reform the implemented
despite like i i with the what inspections staes just has said
if the report the the court so area for interpretation late think i that we always bad publicity will to in the süddeutsche zeitung the today the example
over billion dm wrong happened in the eu court its commission not approval accusation of financial mismanagement this it has the the a press the the mr 
i must you than also questions why the members the the court different statements do mr karlsson against the press has you obviously something otherwise said than against the commission control
i think that the principles the the next annual the the court urgent must be clarification
the commission and the court are really compulsory this to ensure
there must objectives for the different sectors be the so the public opinion really can assess what there is improve otherwise is the any year same time although the parliament the basis the the reports the the court the further reforms reduce clearly the are appreciation from for the reforms the the commission
the effect of the the public opinion the by this type headlines however again almost whole way the world is because first and especially the the mistakes fixated and see not what there all is taken to reforms really possible to make
i i therefore again a urgent call to together to be how we such direction can the so we next year better against the press are armed
mr the president gentlemen colleagues we have still not as long ago a agreement with the court made the means that we already the advance and strictly all to know can to what there in the report the the court the we have also agreed that we on the silence would keep
to my sorry must i now the mr karlsson that the members the the court the obviously not the the agreement the
i like than also fact questions or a such procedure the next years for repeat room is
i think that you agree serious on the culture in your organisation must give if the not more possible is such agreements with the court to make
in the second place have several colleagues already rightly the the lack the clarity out
know you mr karlsson if you the figures not your report the be they involved word
mrs rühle and other speakers have just what percentages mentioned
if i note that the to a error to is than can mrs schreyer course not more have that the court confirms that the commission the the good way is because that would course the way slope are
that the you however not in the report and i am the was to year in year from to hear that the member for responsible are and we but for without that man and horse be mentioned in the report
what mrs the the laan earlier has said and this am i the at that agree should in the report to are
you must the member with particularly mention also already the you this like i not let to let by the member if members the the court operate
we must finally assess what the new commission in has done
what i concerned mrs schreyer is that you many the the obligations the you you made to the the comments the the court meet to to not you fulfilled
there is therefore the a and another to improve for the future otherwise remains your formal insurance that you the fight the irregularities seriously you tackle a empty promise
mr the president although the court not positive assurance for can provide is the tone the the report in are whole more than in previous years
i like the commission and commissioner schreyer in the particularly congratulate with the comment the the court that many changes where this to asked had already have place or still place will find
there is especially many admiration for the programme that last year in the is the
i like i special to the council up with the question why this not further is with article the the financial rules
the parliament was very smooth with the give the are vision and i hope that the council in the will are same to do and for christmas are position will adopt
now i this say like i also say that i disappointed was on the report if the first step in the discharge
the report is to political in the negative sense the the floor
heavy criticism the avoid and there be not names mentioned
other members have here already the out
member must under pressure be the if they abuse make the the resources the the community and groups the this parliament must be mentioned if they the money the the taxpayers abuse as my mr mr kuhne earlier this year already said
the error must exactly be mentioned so there direction can be the for the reduction that
we must the method the the court under the look take and look how its independence the the institutions and the by its to control programmes strengthened can be
possible must this the president the the court more power to to decisions to can take on the method and the  the the court
i like also still what say on the place the the parliament in this report
the report clearly the positive from on the steps the by the parliament are taken to the by the court the the denounce set problems the to solve to my opinion to positive
many the this changes are still not hard made or only partially hard made
the parliament can the most problems solve by quickly the two fronts in action to to the first by are own internal audit in to to and the second by three statute the to take which urgent need is a statute for the members a statute for assistants and a statute for the groups
to finally can you mr karlsson while we if parliament already this changes changes perhaps america to help the the counted the the vote
the error the the count in florida is without doubt to high
perhaps can what thoughtfulness from the european union help to the problems this the to solve and george bush are legitimate place in the history to give namely in the brings
mr the president mrs the commissioner mr the president the the court this new report the the court that us just was presented is for the committee in insofar interesting that the several points contains on problems the the management the the community budget but same any for restrictive interpretations the would can resulting from a acrosstheboard assessment the certain data
addition this points have we however need the more detailed clarification and analyses to progress to make
i will in the briefly three points deal
first a deficient problem already to often the not clear distinction made between fraud and irregularities
the is fact remarkable that same court stated that the number fraud limited is
a another issue that in the report the dealt the the problems in the with vat
vat is a important source the income for the community budget
we must however the that the is to a complicated system
the  and the composition of differences the country to country
some countries have example a regional vat
we must also continue give on the achieve the harmonisation
the third subject that i wish the to cut has the the the discussion the yesterday place during the presentation the the annual the the court in the sitting the the commission control
the has when asked today is there again several times to referred that the court expressly the countries would mention where fraud and irregularities are the
i would want warn against such practices
we must not the find to to scapegoats or in our institutions or in the member
also based the method the the commission the testing which we a incomplete picture have the the situation
the report the the court highlighted still greater than in the past the situation the the area the the management the and the control the community resources by the member
the on the this analysis must we european members but also the commission proposals do the improvement the the systems for the management and the financial control in the member the are the member the this systems must apply to the protection the the financial interests the the union to can guarantee
i decision therefore with a call to a better cooperation with the council
mr the president mr the president the the court mrs the commissioner during the over two year has the court the the area the the common agricultural six special reports published
from the special report on the allocation the subsidies the the marketing the meagre milk was that the absence the measures and the cases the falsification and fraud in not the the other agricultural their unprecedented know
in its report on the marketing the butter proposed the court the that the subsidies the the food the the budget represent they added this to that the allocation of far the transparent is and that the effectiveness with particularly the influence the the subsidies the the income the the farmers strong to wish house
in both cases draw only a small number countries and a small number economic operators benefit the the policy
the most special report the the court the the area the the common agricultural has the the the arable the conclusion the this report was that in the framework the the community budget between and over thirteen tune euro more is spent than cure acceptable is
the arable represent although the the  but only the the product
in was essentially the the appropriations rightly the the the inexperienced the only of while the smaller beneficiaries good for but the the expenditure represented
given the this circumstances concluded the court rightly that the better is the support the the farmers not to base the prices production or area the support must other to be granted the basis the the question the the farmers or the 
the is here to documents the market quality the a common agricultural the the denounce to which large farmers still still be allowed the detriment the smaller farmers and which countries and regions from central still still the prefer to over peripheral countries and regions
although the annual the the court in principle to objective has the most aspects the the in the during the the year published special reports meet to to lack the mentioned verified in the place of the attention spent the other issues which not specific studies are made
i like first something say on the procedure for the submit the the annual the the parliament and the commission control i am welcome the members to hear that the situation this year  is than previously
hope can we joint conclude that we the right approach have found for the discharge
mr staes the sorry i that i not in the opportunity was already the during the sitting the yesterday set questions to answer
possible i i today with same problem to camps
i i however clear made that we still but the the beginning are the this discharge and i hope sincerely that we be the opportunity to a reasonable answer to give the any question the the parliament or the commission control and that all questions the yesterday and now in this debate are the sufficient be answered
i like the now have on the creation the the assurance and the issue the the figures
the first like i not only mr blak the rapporteur for the discharge the this year but also mr mulder that point that we the procedure for the up the the assurance which we closely work with this parliament and the commission control gradually have amended and developed to account to the with the wish the this commission have we in the procedure the specific comments processed the are made on the different 
this is the result the the to now to pursued discussion
i say with emphasis against mr mulder mr blak mrs the the laan mrs morgan and all other speakers the on this issue have about that the court this development will continue
i like there however not few doubt on let there that a procedure if this the very gradually must develop we should not entire change cause in the method for collation and planning the the data because than would our activities not more meet the the us under the treaty set demands
than now something on the accuracy the the figure where the mr blak to early or
i like not demagoguery happened but intellectual given is this question the same level if the question when you you into your women to we
the you i not questions the i impossible can answer
we have last year not figure mentioned and we have this year nor a figure mentioned
therefore the question or the figure the last year corresponds with the figure the this year is unreasonable
a assurance is a very detailed event the the not only account taken with the specific comments on the different areas the the budget but the also a general assessment made
we will that in detail study with your excellent 
i am welcome to hear that you on staff has that in the is the report the the court in a at together to summarise
this am i very welcome that
perhaps will we the person the you robbing
we will certainly in the opportunity to to that all by to take
i will ensure ensure that the rapporteur for the discharge fully the the informed the the the all details
few members the the commission control have out the the need the more exactitude
you has right that we precise must are in our comments
if you this annual at will you see that the court seeks the the approval the the accounts a actually instrument to make for research the the shortcomings in the management the the agricultural
a delay the more than two year is however the a restrictive factor for the gentlemen the this event
we point there also the that we the the other area the the the expenditure in the member not procedure have the similar is with the approval the the accounts
that is the area the the structural
the is very difficult still  to are if we not on a  have that us the answers would provide where we to questions example with the to the european social fund
i promise solemn that we together with the commission control and the parliament will continue fight for  information so we the real problem the can tackle
the court is the at agree with the parliament that the here not only is to the reform the the commission or to a reform the the financial control the the parliament
also the court must are working adapt
than now something on the issue the the mention the names i am the not agree with the mr the van that this report to political would are with this office that we not the names mention the must be mentioned
you listening now to a member that if rapporteur the the commission development ever responsible was for not only the mention the two countries but also the two companies what to result had that the court for the court the justice was taken
the mr the van suggests that we to political reasons afraid would are to the names to mention the necessary are for the control the we any individual important find i can him however the opposite proof
in this specific case was the clear that the court the first instance us supported with are judgement that we not only the right have this names to mention but also the duty to that to do
if you in the report the the court look to the measures the the commission against pollution see you that there not only countries be mentioned but also regions the french member the the court the brittany the mr   has not protest broad against the fact that we page after page on are brittany have written
if the relevant is for the control mention we everything what appointed must be
that is the policy and the principle the the court
the is not the intention that the court a political instrument the they must a objectively instrument are for your political control here in the parliament and we will this continue fight
i promise moreover solemn that we carefully will listen to the ask the the parliament to   we will ensure ensure that already this instruments also can be used to the need the the political control to can meet
the next time that i report  will i this back and you the the our next meeting the plan for us programme for the next year
mr mulder i stress what i yesterday already said
from technical statistical view given would for specific  for each country and the main political areas enormous many staff need are because by the reduce the the population the need for more testing the this testing require than as enormous many work that according i no that still feasible eight
therefore must we other methods use we must the approach apply the we are agreed the the area the the specific comments and the the approve the the accounts the  better do with the the other controls not only the the court but also the the commission and the member
i thought morning also still the florida mr the van and i am welcome that i not responsible was for the control the the  in the specific the
as is there always something where you welcome that can are
hope is this this discussion concludes and can i be the questions answer the i possibly forget am
i must still just back to the what you mr blak said
you you that we the report restructure and that have we done
i like you remind remind that we the report after the dialogue with the commission control have staterun
you proposed for the the report a reflects to make the the portfolio the the commissioners or the subordinate
i think that not good idea
commissioners as the mr fischler the responsible is for the implementation the the half budget must a greater chapter to than the commissioners the nothing with the budget to make have
let we a open attitude adopt and look how we the reporting can linked to optimum results to obtain
you thank mr karlsson
the debate is closed
gentlemen colleagues as you perhaps you noticed had the last part the the speech the the president the the court burden the a selfflagellation virus that heated managed caused in the communication between the president and this parliament
therefore will the sitting during two or three minutes be cut to the virus to destroy and this technical problem the to solve
the sitting the during three minutes cut because a technical problem
general product
the the item is the report on the mrs gonzález álvarez behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the proposal for a directive the the european parliament and the council on general product com c cod
mr the president we deal today a proposal on general product
the commission environment health and consumer the the european parliament take the on the whole taken a good proposal
there is therefore but little in changed
perhaps is the quality the the proposal the partly to explain by the fact that the commission certainly social bodies has consulted the have explained what difficulties the the the implementation the the directive from have occurred
a number findings the this social bodies is in the proposal the the commission back to find
if example mention i a point where the council what effort that has but that for the european parliament very important is and where we at behind are namely a ban the the implement to third countries the products the if unsafe be as
as be there in the directive the more proposals done where we not effort that have
therefore have we not already to many changed we have only a few changes made which the rights the the consumers according us better be guaranteed
this report is by the environment the the european parliament with broad majority approved and i will the result the the vote in the commission than also defend
if that the would done would we not be legitimately by issues if the mad the we afternoon will deal or problems with dioxin and genetically modified products finally want we a certainly harmonisation the the  achieve and there in the general for ensure that consumers be informed in the language the the country where they the products buy
mr the president there are in the environment also few amendments tabled the we not can accept the amendments are today again tabled and fly against the earlier mentioned principles in
i mention two examples
the first example the amendment
the those want the a member delete which producers and distributors be asked the competent authorities the the member immediately in knowledge to to the a dangerous product as they this know the have
we can not allow that this member disappears
a other member that the like delete the the overriding and the in that the overriding a effective monitoring the dangerous products not in the way must are
we find that also this paragraph not must disappear
some amendments as the amendments and have relations the affairs the especially the united kingdom into and i must say that the by the british members the all groups pse ppe or the greens totally are defended
the is here to typical british things if shops the charitable and trade the less or more in the private atmosphere place
members from other countries as myself understand not always just good why the colleagues from the uk the here so ensure on make but this amendments are in the environment approved and therefore must i the here explain
mr the president i thank the commission and the council for their cooperation the the up the this report
i think that the commission environment health and consumer a report has up which the rights the the consumers can be strengthened and their safety can be increase
given the the events the the the last years especially the  have events think i that this a very important directive is i hope than also that the proposal by a broad majority the this parliament will be adopted although few amendments as said against the spirit the the in the environment approved proposal contrary
mr the president ladies and gentlemen the made commission legal affairs and internal market is in be a very other opinion agree than the commission the committee the commission environment health and consumer
we find that this directive the many the points must be amended but our amendments are by the commission environment health and consumer unfortunately not adopted
i am the group than also extremely grateful that they this amendments the supports and they today in the plenary sitting again the table brings
i like only the two aspects like
in the first place find we the wrong that also in this directive on product there is the liability for services we are principle the opinion that questions in the with liability for services certainly not in a directive on product belong but as need parallel somewhere otherwise regulated must be
my second comment the the earlier as praised calculated
the majority the the commission legal affairs and internal market is the opinion that this not legal there
after our recent experience i refer to the decision the the court the justice on advertising can i the parliament fact only but economic the recommendations the the commission legal affairs and internal market the the plenary sitting the i to take because they finally for such questions responsible is
otherwise seems the i certainly not impossible that the court the justice also on this issue a painful judgement will do
to the simple reason have we a another position welcome and we can the plenary sitting only but economic the the that position the the majority the the legal commission the to the that applies with particularly for the amendments and the intended are to the calculated the to weakest
behalf my group must i this add that if a the this amendments not the adopted this to result has that the group the report in are whole will reject because we the final tired are here constantly proposals the to take the in fight with the right are
mr the president in march the this year have we the directive on  for passenger adopted
if the directive already was into was the accident in austria perhaps not happened
the that that legislation here a important role plays and that the desirable is that directives precisely the a as sensitive area if product as quickly possible be into
i hope that this for may the case will are
this regulation for product is because a general directive the especially the has the the areas the not under the existing directives the
i like the commission thank because they a new and extremely important point the this regulation adds namely the suspicion the movement
that the in that products if safe be as if they the the european standards meet
i think that this principle especially for the consumer the enormous importance is because as always can be up or a product already than not the the standards meets in this the is amendment particularly important for the consumer
the the namely that  external must be carried and that  not only by entrepreneurs be issued but also by neutral external bodies be controlled the confidence the the consumers in such statements will the course considerably increase
with amendment that the publication the standards in the journal the i i course problems the established copyright properly because the the national  to and the european union would therefore  must pay
further must we us course ask how standards there already in europe there and how european standards this still the would to
i i this serious reservations the and would this provision therefore like removed see
if we a calculated consider should we there not automatically from to that our standards all the world the best are
many countries have their own regulations and safety the in the countries considerably better the their objective answer than the standards the we currently in europe apply
mr the president mr the commissioner the report the mrs gonzález álvarez is the itself a conclusive whole my group think however otherwise on the enlargement the liability to services something that also already by the commission was proposed
i give a example the many areas be products now not more by the producer in other the but in question parts the the distributor made
everyone the somewhere in the  the safety the a product can influence would now if  producer be as that means that all operators the still something  if producer be given
we find that in such cases the trade not must be responsible with the legal obligations on product the the the producer rest
there there other civil resources the the consumer certainly sufficient protection offer as the possibility to compensation the basis the contractual liability
the has i fact surprised that the experts the the commission this problem not from own movement have resolved and i am that that the new commissioner the again will consider
i hope that the commission there not problem the will make  and institutions without profit the the provisions the this directive for product from to looked
what the  the am i the agree agree that a product not must be carried if the commission the trade the has banned or withdrawal the the market has 
only the request the the commission to implementation the a  can however not sufficient reason are to whole arms the the exports on to to
as the colleagues for i already have said must least the proof be accepted that in the country the destination other safety apply
i can the commission therefore only but urgent economic this  still agree to study
this is only the first reading
in the second and third reading have we the famous vote need and the will we certainly not to if the report there as new if now
mr the president i add i the the general congratulate the the to the mrs gonzález álvarez the the a pleasure and thorough rapporteur has shown
perhaps were the  the the british  for its sometimes difficult to follow but also this could they with a  view to look
this directive would by the full parliament welcomed must be the issue the general product and the additions that are the large important
in the commission environment health and consumer have we under the way leadership the our rapporteur a series amendments approved the my group again and block today the the parliament recommend
we are less welcome with a number amendments that later is added
we have the justification the this amendments heard and also the industrial arguments can had the we in the commission already had heard
this have us not can convince and we will against the most the this amendments vote
perhaps can mrs lulling or a the its colleagues before the vote place us tell what the precise very were the with particularly the english version the amendment
we would the amendment can support if the  plant and maintenance would task and not plant if maintenance
i am that convinced that the here to a mistake is and if this confirmed the will we this amendment support
this proposal contains a few extremely valuable general principles
include is a principle that the the the another on the the parliament  take namely the principle that we not products should export if we think that they not safe are for our own people in the european union
as the trade growing have we still more to make with this problem we must this tackle and the not let variety because for us the rest the the world there not to does or the now is to the safety the their health their food or the by us  product
we must now also to the the between products and services look
the commission has now a texts but welcome step in the direction taken and perhaps like the commissioner this in are answer more on say
to finally like i still something say on   and already the other exchanges the paid and question manufacturers articles
the  are welcome with the general protection the this directive
they have however a waiver need the the obligation under article the on which they information must provide the they simply not have
our amendments and have the the that point
i hope that the parliament this amendments can support because the can however being intention are this valuable  the usually not profit have impossible to make by means the a provision on information information must the have the large manufacturers and the new or good tested products
if the seller the buyer always can inform on the nature the the goods and the restrictions the the information must that sufficient are
president directives must now once as now and than evaluated and adapted be and fact happening that many to little
the way which the european commission that this time has tackled deserves what us the congratulate
the followed procedure is excellent and is also very including been
we are the this directive in a tension between what cure the producers expect can be and the protection the the consumer
i am the what that the in certain sense agree with what the mr lehne has said that the recent statements the the court that have hit that we us here in a the area are if the is to what the union the and not can do
with particularly the point the the  is something where we very good to must look
as the the the affairs now is equal my group to to the proposals as the before to support but i would the the price to if the commissioner the this aspect still agree what more in would can to
we support moreover the proposals the the commission if the is to the enlargement the the scope the the directive to services and also the into the  products although there the the areas still the more would can done but that is in the future still the the us the
we are the agree with the rapporteur this where he greater emphasis has the the information the the consumer on the risks and on transparency with particularly the the area the the health and the safety
that must indeed the general principle are
two final on one amendment very specific if the is to the proposal the the commission that producers immediately the competent authorities the the informed to if they find that a product dangerous is
we think that that a very important element is
there is a proposal to that to delete with if recital under other that producers itself not would must  and also in the light the the professional
we think that the this point the both really must are the the protection the the consumer and that a producer the discovered that are product really dangerous is not the are hands must continue are
the finally still a question the the european commission the regard the article if the is to the european standards and the question or the know must be made
i would the commission want ask this still something more the in to to
mr the president to this proposal have we certainly awaited
what we us however must ask is or the fully up the the objectives the we eight year ago when the in the prospect was the for view had and or the not new questions stated
that applies not much for the report the mrs gonzález álvarez the really everything in the work has the to the before directive to improve but rather for the guidelines and for a part the the proposal itself
in the first place seems the that that the commission the in this case has into the main degrees the the process to a administrative body without that this new role the a transparent legal framework is for i think the in first body the the competences the the research and the the control the its decisions to quickly action
also is the only already with the to the employment remarkable that the report not considerations contains on the harmful consequences the possible important decisions for a company and especially its workers the possibility there because that emergency automatically the start to and probably a long period will expiry before can be the or the decision this already than not based was
there the other for in a calculated for products the if dangerous are classified a sign the civilisation in the union but there is not answer the the question or that ban consistent is with the socalled pierrelouis   the by international agreements the the
also the concept the liability both with the to the definition the product if to the opportunities the  to out and the extent which a such concept the services can be applied seems the interpretation subject and can therefore to bottomless be criticised
let we also the possible interpretations the product if raw in a  not forget and the positive impact of the the to to a healthy workplace that the however difficult because there not reliable european  is and different legal the application are the the recognition the 
to finally is the desirable that the commission the existing community texts the other  and what so they not only still transparent be but also really reliable and the useful
president course is the need a the sharp the consumer to have in the european union
but is the also need a fully harmonised uniform protection to have
still apart the the high costs the nevertheless regulations and the favour red seems i that not as such good idea
the seems i better more account to the with subsidiarity
a danish or german consumer the other safety than a dutch or italian consumer
with the diversity must we in the directive general product more account the
further believe i that there not the there for the european commission to to to with proposals on the safety the services
the nature the services whether the this also less for
a product can by the producer be its but the a service is that however the difficult for the service
i am welcome with the exceptions the be made for shops the charitable and organisations without profit as for articles the if manufacturers articles be sold the markets or the 
finally question i i the or amendment the the environment the further recognise precisely formulated is
the seems i not problem if there between standardisation and authorities a agreement to the is the the european standards for the public free accessible makes but that is something otherwise than that the european commission the european standards know makes
like hear i this the believe the the commissioner
achieved  europe
thank you  europe that you the addressing to your own children
or must i earlier say thank you daughter byrne
thank you because all directives on safety the welfare the us european citizens the the view have to to start the minors the children but also elderly
that is certainly a good matter
i remind i however a serious disagreement with my daughter  when they nine year old was
they wanted in its cannot the streets the and i i when said no you must not only the streets the there must someone otherwise the are otherwise is the dangerous
when i a few year later my second daughter the six or seven year under is the only additional to she the oldest daughter daughter i if not only way but my small  the
a good  must indeed know that he the must ensure that are children not risk are but you can they not under a against  the they must the only the streets the can
why i i that all told
because all directives on safety balanced must are they must a balance find
safety is need but we must the production not stranglehold the has freedom need
what directives can however actually be carried and now address i i to the representative the the council if the council refuses the directive on the monitoring and the control the the safety the to to
than will the this just as end if with the mad cows thousand safety and however must we now unfortunately millions animals finish
mr the president i congratulate the rapporteur with its work the report is meet the the most  the the consumer
there must a constructive dialogue expedite which this associations if full partners be as we the socialists the the commission industry to our support the the proposal the the commission to the transparency the the information and  the if dangerous send products to increase
this responsibility must the the distributors and the producers to be the in insofar they the them the application is the producers and distributors must clearly guarantee for the consequences the the the their products linked foreseeable risks way the the plant to the maintenance
the is the them to the authorities and the consumers to inform and the caused damage to restore
the  the dangerous products must not if last resort be as the is important that the this possibility use the made as there in the light the the recent scientific findings reason to doubt there
the community standardisation must take the adequate scientific studies this must a new impetus to be given the the cooperation between the member the both the area the the research on product in the general if the the level the  in the particularly children unemployed new  new has and people the the a certain  suffering
reliability on product and a effective  to the european label doubt a added the a at that we in particularly difficult to not to say critical circumstances situation
all measures are welcome the condition that they the confidence restore and demonstrate that the production and distribution the european products based is the the respect the the health the the workers the social rights the environment the competition and a strict legislation on safety
already what not the this pattern up must to be had and destroyed since products the we itself reject not should be carried to less developed countries
i hope that the before directive us in the opportunity will to meet to to the the wish and doubts the the european citizens on product
mr the president ladies and gentlemen there there since a directive on general product
this debate is intended to the existing directive to process the police experience the to processing and abuses to overcome
i doubt or we this in sufficient extent in are managed
admitted the is here to difficult legal questions
the scope the the directive must be set the the many national and community provisions where products the must meet the be also certain safety regulated
we must ensure ensure that we a entire consumer guarantee without things occasions or perhaps even contradictory to regulate
the possibility to external to let certify that a product the the rules meets would particularly useful are the would the situation more and clearer make
the was however better been a general european regulation in the form the a regulation to take and the a end to make the the addition other there the european and national provisions
there there example also many provisions the regard the food the currently by means the proposals for regulations be review and slashed i think that we the a high safety can achieve
the scope the this directive is also extended to other areas
the fact that also products the be used to a service to out in the directive be included lead to that traders and professionals still more duties to imposed the fact under the responsibility the the producer the we have the commission the a other opportunity asked soon a proposal on the safety the services to do
i see than also not in why we the services already in this directive would must into in place the the proposal the the commission the to wait the is now already to for that there difficulties with the competences between the individual regulations will the and that the legal in the during the time will increase
still a short comment on the 
one want we strong different safety and demands we as the mr blokland that there with regional and national wish account the taken but hand export we as national provisions to other countries
i think that there the this point already in the model the the directive a fundamental contradiction you so we the proposal what this the not can support
mr the president the is certainly not original to now to say that there still still a large distance is between the citizens and the european union
the citizens have still less confidence in the capabilities the the union to example the food to guarantee and that mistrust eclipses the positive results the the work that the union in this sector does
on will we the today have
in this the seems the i important the emphasis to to the the political gentlemen the the directive which we will will vote
thanks the good proposal the the commission that by mr álvarez further improve is have we now last a text the good news is for consumers as also that from the support the the not governmental organisations the them represent
the legislation on product the improve strengthened and more made in the particularly the rules on the products the to still to not in the existing vertical legislation were included
there is many work opposition to the interaction between vertical rules on certain categories and this new horizontal directive better to defining the result is certainly satisfactory
i like like the emphasis to the the important the the amendments the the commission environment they clarify the picture for the  and clarifying the responsibility the the manufacturers but also the the distributors the the skills the products the dangerous will to are
i hope that the final version the the rapporteur confirmed will be i am the with its agree what the the amendments the again for the vote in the plenary are tabled and hope that this directive there quickly by will to so the european citizens as quickly possible see that the union the actually for their safety commitment
first like i the rapporteur mrs gonzález álvarez as the rapporteurs for opinion the gentlemen rübig and lehne and the involved committees the i thank for their very full report on the proposal for a directive the the european parliament and the council on general product
the under proposal is a answer the the many problems the the the last time the the health and the safety the the consumers have occurred
although the directive formally provides in sooner and revision must this perhaps also given be in the framework the the closer efforts the the commission the improvement the the health and the safety the the consumers
although the revised directive only for a limited time the application will are the food will this the the long duration the opportunities for the tackle the the security the  considerably improve
i will briefly the most aspects the this proposal from the before do
the idea the the the directive the basis is is very simple only safe products should the the market be the
the mean we both european if imported products
with the directive on the general product be two important objectives aim the first want we the the consumers in very europe a consistent high level the protection the their health and safety offer and the second want we a good force the the internal market guarantee
as the rapporteur already mentioned has there with all involved extended consultation place on the implementation the the before directive during that consultation were certain weak places the the light the we now try to improve
we clarify the first the scope the the directive
with this directive want we the consumer the insurance give that he or they the the safety the the products the the can
also want we this any disposable in the sectoral legislation filled i think example the the  or the the 
of is rarely in the specific legislation there if this aspects however the in sectoral legislation are regulated will the corresponding provisions the this directive not the application are
this means also that if new sectoral legislation the was this legislation the place its the the corresponding provisions in this directive
as you know to we a authority this authority must itself ensure for a  and that system will than in the place to the what in the directive general product is included
us objective with the directive is ensure ensure that the consumers the best possible protection to when they certain products use
this applies also for products the initially only for professional but now also for personally use for are i think example the  and the products the be used the services
we wanted us system more make
therefore had we additional obligations into for information by producers and distributors
the current situation is but ideal
the is unacceptable that the authorities the the member sometimes the the authorities in the united states must hear that a the european product dangerous is
notification is although compulsory in the united states but to now to still not in the european union
as you know can the not the a good law speak if this not good the applied
the member must now the tasks strengthen the the authorities the with the monitoring are responsible
they must for sanctions ensure and also links to with other member
there will with particularly a network the with enforcement responsible authorities must be up this is also very important the industrial position from examined
the industry must there because the the the can that all competitors equal conditions be guaranteed with particularly also when the to imported products is
we must also the  the early system the the commission improve
the scope the removal will be extended and also voluntary by the industry taken measures for the withdrawal the products the the market to contain
the practical implementation the the system will be improve
we offer now also the possibility to this system open to to for third countries and for with particularly countries we have the procedures for emergency the community level simplified to quickly to can action as opinion is issued by a advisory committee
also have we now exports banned the products the in the union the the market are achieved
a another issue where i your attention the like draw is that the transparency this must be improve
the consumers have often not confidence because they not know what there way is
nothing is  for the confidence the the consumers than the impression that there something way is which they not know have
we are the opinion and that is also the general policy the the commission that the citizens the right have to know the what real dangers they are exposed and what measures the prevent the the dangers are taken
the only reduction this the the with professional as this is defined in article the the treaty
this is however not the application if the health in the affected is and i expect that this exception the strict way and in limited sense will be interpreted
i am welcome that in the report the mrs gonzález álvarez support the expressed the the  the the proposal
many the the tabled amendments forms a improvement the the text and are therefore for the commission acceptable
the you i to first the amendments to mention the the commission not can accept
the first the in the amendments and proposed manufacturers articles the by shops the charitable by organisations without profit private or the  and the  as the mr whitehead already said be sold from to looked the the obligation to information and documentation on risk programmes and origin the the product to provide
the obligations for the distributors the since part were the the directive are the a very general and flexible way formulated
the only new necessary is that distributors the the exercise the their activities the them available documentation keep and the request the the authorities be so the origin the the products can be overtaken
this means not that distributors itself research must do to the origin the a the product but only that they the identification the the product andor manufacturer not destroy and any information cross the january can give on the origin the the product
this new necessary means not enormous new responsibility for this type shops
normal about satisfactory the shops the charitable already used articles so they this can  the others
their trade is such the nature that the not the them can expect that they itself the origin the their products check
also is the for the  absolutely not interesting the origin the each individual breakdown were manufacturers article after to draw
there is therefore a large extent the flexibility in the requirements the the directives for distributors
this requirements can be applied the this shops and the the a way the compatible is with the nature the their activities
to however meet to can to the the concerns ensure and to the situation further to clarify would we possibly can give on the possibility to in the relevant recital a statement the to take which that that in case the individual used by private paid objects the perhaps impossible is the competent authorities information and documentation to provide on possible risk programmes and on the origin the the product
the second the in amendment proposed a gradually from the considerations to delete namely the seek according what in the annex the the directive clear conditions must be the for the obligation the the business to the authorities the the informed to to the dangers
this seek is necessary to excessive bureaucracy to avoid
the third the in amendment proposed the the preamble a necessary to to add according what the member carefully documented reports must up in cooperation with the matter expert and independent public or private bodies
the demand however that member external bodies the involve goes in against the subsidiarity
in the amendments and the the commission asked after to think on a approach for the safety the the in amendment mentioned services and this within a the time specific proposals to do
the commission is already are with a research to this issue but the into in the directive the a such precise defined task would to very contrary against the initiative the the commission
with amendment the proposed change the to to in the reference to different articles
the first part is for the commission acceptable but the is not usual in legal texts the the community the content the the articles again to give which the referred
if we the floor producer replace by service ensure we for more confusion in place the more clarity no in the directive is because a definition for the service
under the definition the producer the already the providers whose activities a impact can have the the  the the products
in amendment the proposed in the framework the the general obligation for producers to safe products the the market to to to refer to the precautionary
the precautionary is a general principle the management by the competent authorities and can not directly be imposed the producers
the commission is the there however the that agree that this a important principle is and this the the revision the the directive account must be taken therefore would we in the first recital the the directive yes can refer
although we the fully understanding have for the idea the in the amendments and to expression the the according what in the officially journal a full text with all european standards published must be would something like fundamental changes with the that to in the relations between the community and the european  this will probably also more money the the community budget must be allocated
the reason this is that  owner are the their standards and the most of a part the their activities finance with the sale the standards
this issue has a impact the almost very the community  and therefore can this not be dealt in the framework the the current revision the the directive
in amendment the proposed the  the the member to harmonise the on the by the commission and the consultation committee programmes detailed guidelines
although the commission for cooperation and common principles is goes the proposed wording in against the subsidiarity
we are the there not that agree that as in the second part the amendment the proposed the the a member calls also measures to take if the business already adequate measures the prevent the risk programmes has taken
us objective is precisely the business the to encourage from own movement such measures to take and this goes this proposal against in
in amendment the proposed in the directive provisions the to take for compensation
this is however a issue the civil right and this have we the directive liability for therefore must we us the here not deal
in amendment is the demand included that within a the time a network for product the up
although the commission for the rapid achieve the this network is must this a agreement be achieved between the member
therefore is the not realistic this a timetable the to give
in the first part the amendment the proposed that only information on the risk programmes the the public the available the the
this is not acceptable this consumers also the right have the information on countries research provided this information not under the already earlier by i described professional in limited sense is
to finally asking you with amendment that the commission agree in the two and not agree in the three year a report tabled on the implementation the the directive
although the commission not rejection the the relation the this proposal is this not feasible with the limited resources the the commission
the commission can not agreement to with the majority the the be in the plenary sitting tabled amendments
the you i to first the position the the commission to give on the amendments the we not can accept
the amendments and the most part the amendment are  the the current text the the directive the outside the revision is
the commission has not report been the problems with the current wordings and amendment of would down the the rules mean
in amendment the proposed directly with the product the on services from to the unless this product by the original producer the made
in the discussions in the council equal the to services to deal in the framework the the  what for us acceptable is
with amendment would products which specific directives there least be the the application the the directive
this is for us not acceptable because in this specific directives often not provisions prevent for   etc
in amendment the the possibility is through external certification the proof to make the movement the a product with the requirements the the directive
the can a such certification course always use if evidence but the must this course not as if foolproof proof
with amendment the proposed the time for decisions to emergency to to to six months this is in the most cases however not sufficient to permanent measures to take
the the also a exception the the calculated proposed for the case namely which the producer can demonstrate that he meets the the in the  current safety
this is for us not acceptable this products the the community level if extremely dangerous are were and which quickly measures had be taken not exported should be
in the amendment the also proposed ensure to ensure that the possibility the the involved parties to their opinion to give on a by the community taken measure not favour does the national solutions
this this not appeal is the what nature than also seems us this unnecessary to are
further the in amendment proposed the calculated not the application to let are the a product that was banned while there further research way was
this is however exactly the period which a real risk for exports there
if from the research would will that the product safe is the the ban automatically withdrawn
in the amendments and the proposed information on dangerous products only the the public available to make when decided is to a ban or to withdrawal the the market also the the the that not exchange the under professional areas information must place between the for the  competent authorities
since also the consumer the right must have the information on risk programmes the still not for the full hundred cent if such are recognised with including the the cases which the affected measure not ban or a withdrawal the is also this for us not acceptable
also is efficient  impossible if the the subject is the the proposed restrictions in the with confidential information
in amendment the more proposed the the duty for the business to the authorities in knowledge to to the the the the market to to dangerous products
this is for us not acceptable this this precisely a the the keys is in the improvement the the existing directive
also are we the opinion that what the  the the use the the floor the in place the decisions which the is to the at from what information must be passed as in the first part the amendment the proposed more uncertainty than clarity creates
now i extended i explained why the commission the amendments to and with to and with a part the amendment the second part the amendment and the first part the the amendments and not can accept can i you inform what amendments the commission the can accept this are the amendments a part the amendment the first part the amendment and the second part the the amendments and
this amendments forms a improvement and clarification the the proposal the must certain amendments of and with particularly the amendments and the second part the  be improvements the improvement the the text
to finally like i again mrs gonzález álvarez thank for its excellent report the commission can here in large extent that agree

president there seems a misunderstanding to are on the amendments and where we now on to vote
according i is there not conflict between amendment and amendment
therefore i would ensure want favour to both for if for to vote because the both the other a careful solution give therefore not the a or the another but both
mr the president before we start like i that point that there the the end the paragraph a mistake the in the greek translation
this the namely that negotiations will be held under the timed the the nato
that must course under the timed the the un are
i like the services ask this to correct
we can that just the the rapporteur questions
but first like the mr wurtz somewhere objection against been
mr the president i i a question on the order the vote on the amendments the paragraph this is the paragraph on the genocide the the  people
the  the the parliament had up during the sitting the yesterday when the vote this had place by a other order the
the order was logical the the today not
i i therefore for to the  the yesterday to follow this like say first to vote on amendment
we be the us work by very skilful ladies and gentlemen help
in the first version was a mistake the now is corrected but i would the the price to if the rapporteur the mr morillon the both questions like respond
the first question was the the the mr katiforis on the floor simultaneously and the second question was or the order the now is for the right is
mr the president what the first question the clearly the for the that this a mistake is not translation but a mistake in the 
what the order the late i the the the president on to that to decide i remind remind that i in any case against each the this three amendments am
the are both questions answered
we will there the amendment the think that to change
after the vote on amendment
mr the president with explain the the mr katiforis like i the next text proposals i i him here only in the english the hardly the the original text different
i will him just read
welcomes the opening the negotiations on confidencebuilding measures which the october by the minister the foreign affairs the both turkey if greece agreement was achieved
we welcome here only still but the beginning the the negotiations to and not the outcome that
the can we unfortunately still not welcome
the parliament the the resolution the
report a the the mr jové peres behalf the commission fisheries on the communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament on the participation the the european community the regional organisations com c cos
the parliament the the resolution the
explanations resolution b
the mediterranean sea was and is a extremely sensitive area where the large political economic and social problems arise
the most necessary for good relations between countries is a peaceful addition other existence and the promotion the a mutual useful cooperation the footing the equality
the noncommunity mediterranean countries have indeed with large problems to camps the their economic development we see than also the regional differences still greater be
the eu and its member have a large responsibility for this situation
we see because how the developed countries and with particularly the countries the the eu and their companies the natural and human resources exploit the the the foreign debt not only maintained but even increase
the attempt the economic and social model the the eu from to to to the countries the the mediterranean sea and this countries the to take in the new item and in the socalled globalisation the demonstrated the a colonial mentality
a such mentality can however never and to never a basis are for cooperation because the the those their like impose the the weakest with a such mentality be only the interests the the large monopolies companies promoted and not the interests the the peoples and the workers the the countries in this area
a characterise example for this behaviour is the attitude the the member the the eu towards the immigrants from this and other countries many the them be occurring by feelings the uncertainty and by fear for deportation because they not in the exactly are the same rights if the other workers because they often the victims are the modern trafficking and in a  the secondclass citizens be taken
characterise for the community policy are also the different embargo programmes and even military interventions in the countries the refuse the to issues the the decisions the the eu and the new item the exclusion the certain countries the the euromediterranean cooperation and the privileged treatment the other and the distribution the the financial resources the on the not the real needs but the interests the the surrendered capital
to finally should we not forget that the this area also yugoslavia part from makes that the eu and the nato have bombed and that the eu with the terms the the nato the status the candidate has granted the turkey that the the cyprus territory occupied the and sovereign rights the greece disputes
we should nor our responsibility towards a another people the palestinian people forget that in despite the the misery circumstances including the live and in despite the the by the israeli the exerting terror are heroic fight for a country believe
with the resolution be the above issues unfortunately not the the strong  this join fully the the the to now to changes mentality in the eu
also the from clear that the the european oligopoly capital still more  like offer to the wealth the the noncommunity mediterranean countries still more to can exploit and tension
therefore vote the european members the the communist party the greece against this resolution
the conditions for a restoration the the process the barcelona are inadequate
the delay the we have behind the the implementation the the agreements can but partially be justified
this are both the governments the the member the the union if the governments the the mediterranean partner responsible
the political like for the process there sometimes doubt we remind or this important euromediterranean company successful will be concluded
in the light the this evident responsibility had i few amendments tabled the at are to the governments the the 
if this not responsibility take and the not commit can we not talk on a project for a multilateral trade within the region the the mediterranean countries as during the conference the malta in the framework the the  was proposed
also to the  the to solve is political like need and to the date have we the not given
the relations between the resources for the different geographical areas must again be the the democratic transparent and efficient way the is also need the decentralised cooperation sustainable again to launch after a carefully and critical research the the  and deficits in the implementation the the old programme programmes
in the spirit the a harmonised european immigration would we programmes programmes must up for already the young the after a training in the european secondary or university education in their own country want to work apart of must there also legal instruments be created to them a equal treatment to guarantee
that would a demonstrated the respect for the dignity the legal immigrants are
the initiatives the the member the this point must certainly be coordinated example by the european commission this would similar measures for financial support must proposals for young immigrants from the acp
a other type coordination the potential donors both countries if financial institutions the international and regional support in the particularly the the 
a common agreed programme for investment in the mediterranean region is necessary
without coordination is there not dynamic without dynamic are there not impetus for development
to finally the coordination element the is is a broad community strategy for the mediterranean region
this strategy can the objectives the a optimum partnership say this strategy can all initiatives and interventions good financing this strategy can the the partnership a essential instrument make not only to the economic and social growth in the mediterranean region to guarantee but also to europe the opportunity to offer the role the  in the whole region the the to take
therefore vote we for the resolution
 a
i am welcome with this report the the mr  on a proposal for the allocation the financial resources the greece the enlightenment the the burden the eib for the reconstruction the the by the earthquake the september destroyed region 
this aid is given this tragedy more than justified
 a
mr the president i i for this report voted which the the what the european community must do to equality the men and women to achieve
last sunday before i to strasbourg left am i mrs rossi encountered
mrs rossi a pensioner widow has i said why is my pension since i widow am still but the half the what i was when my man still lived
i like emphasise that  in the affected the women also the the item must to the the discussions on equality the men and women
the member must in the  also account the with widows and married women
mr the president the european union is a totally supporter the the human but despite the progress the the last years in europe are made there structural discrimination still still
women have not same rights if men and are still always underrepresented both within the authorities if the managerial positions in the business also are women still still the main victims the maltreatment by the partner and the sexual violence
i like one factor stress the in this issue according i the crucial the the lack the equality in the work
there will not there are the equality as the women not financial independent is and the the man is appropriate to its future to assure
women can only real freedom and equality achieve when they same opportunities to if men to a jobs to find and they not less paid to
i am that convinced that when women by their work once real economic independence have acquired they also really free will are and that other forms the inequality the also will disappear
the proposed new programme for equality between women and men is the most reactionary programme that ever the light has given in the last years
the objective of is the women whole to issues the the  policies the the eu
has the this change can to in the few the women in the decisionmaking the equal opportunities the the work in the participation the the society and elsewhere can not there are if a proactive policy the held which the dignity the the human the the and a society the with unemployment not employment and lack social facilities a society where the human values a  have and to commodity be made
we are the absolutely not agree with the way which the terms equal opportunities and equality be used
in a selected framework can this two terms only one thing mean equal treatment the the majority majority the the workers the the distribution the the with the day greater increasingly social misery equal treatment the the distribution the the poverty the unemployment and parttime
this reactionary policies the the eu are the interests the the workers under the footing the measures the promotion the the equality have bad one objective the like the women whole and already into in the policies the the eu the still  be and still less attention pay the the interests the the people
this text does completely with the general policies the the eu the the clear said that the equality to objective must have the women whole candidate to let be the the new economy
that means therefore that women the under equal conditions with all others must adapt the parttime pleased must take with the abolition the full and stable employment and the reduction the the harping labour
a really  presupposes a very another economic and social policy a policy which women equal opportunities be is the the participation the the prosperity and not the the participation the the poverty i think the example the the reduction the the retired age to year for men and year for women the the improvement the the social facilities by the authorities and free social services and the the abolition the the private health and parttime
we have for this report voted because the again the attention drawing the a number principles on the equality the men and women where we course behind are
all statements on equal opportunities for men and women to however a bitter taste in the light the the european directive the night for women allow
the ban the night for women was a the the rare areas which the social legislation the some countries by women to protect further progress was for workers than for workers
the european institutions are not the ability to the social discrimination against to to the women affected the the area the employment and to therefore equal opportunities to promote in noninflationist sense therefore ensure they for equality to below to
we oppose us against the allow the night for women and the the the on social step
the night in the industry and more in the general in the sector is just harmful for men if women and has not few social and human justify
the only reason for the general introduction the night is the profit the companies
to any social discrimination the this area against to to must night banned to be for both men if women with if only exception the public services in the particularly the hospitals and the public transport where this type work a social usefulness has and the condition that the disadvantages the night compensation be by a very strong reduction the the working and that pregnant women protected be

pt with only delay has the commission end than however the programme in the with the community framework on the equality the men and women tabled the before programme from considerably the are predecessors with particularly the the fourth action that end this year expires
accordance the tabled proposal has the amendment the the methodology to objective the access the nongovernmental organisations to increase and ensure to ensure that they active the the project can participate and contribute
a absolute condition to is that this participation not only within the union but also in the member actually the promoted
as the rapporteur rightly out is the important that the commission based the the were that in a real democracy all citizens men and women participate the the economic life the decisionmaking and the social cultural and civil activities and the proportion represented are
they must however not from the view lose that the measures the promotion the the equality the men and women only a sustainable result will that if they by to with actions the strengthening the the women with particularly in the fact reality the the different 
to to assure that women and men the cultural social and economic area equal opportunities have and to discrimination the on the gender to reduce and to prevent has the commission for a dual approach elected which our commission rights the the women and equal opportunities the agree is
special measures the favour the women must not the the second place to but parallel the the political integration be taken
in specifically is the to five  what extent the terms in the work the right the participation and representation and the equal access to social rights properly
under line b is this million euro allocated
that is a considerably but necessary amount which also the made committee has agreed because the here a political priority the
previous the the decisionmaking on this fifth action would we however like the fourth programme under the look have taken
i hope the very that the commission future any year time the balance the will make so the european parliament the results more can analyse and deal
time is a important factor there are in this report very what unclear and unfortunate down find because we under extreme time had discuss and vote and because the amendments not in all languages available were
i i only reservations the the content the this report
example when as as often in this parliament the called that there a study to the effects the general working the carried a majority the the parliament has the basis the existing knowledge because already clearly certainly that there in the member with flexible working many better to life is than with a collective solution the far the the reality the
further think i that a code for the media not feasible is
when women the a discriminatory way be  is there but a thing that help active  and  and national and european members must in any specific case strong protest
despite i i for the report voted one because a significant number  the my group is honoured hand because the demand that there research the done to the situation the women the the national markets and to the inadequate access the the 
we have statistics with to gender  data need to this clarity to to the demand that the fifth framework the the structural the probably the  instruments the our community are with the community equal and with the programmes daphne stop phare and meda must to encourage is completely rightly
i i for the compromise voted the joint are adopted
same like i my large surprising express on the look the children and the age next parents life and  and the simple proper love the clear that from the justification the amendment concession the find the the necessary resources to the harmonious combination the family and work to simplify especially by the create the  for better childcare and elderly what i interpret if also eu for childcare in the own liberté by the own parents which the next the the need the childcare and the concern for older families forms obstacles for the professional political or social life the women during certain periods the their life
the are with particularly the wordings forms obstacles and the need the childcare and the concern for older families the i serious ensure concern
are also a professional political or social life as the in the justification is the highest and only gentlemen for the individual human
is that what where the political the most gentlemen the importance and must now the life the nuclear the the society and the the linked your near and human values also from name the the eu the this way neglected and received be
what the  a on the proposal for a decision the the council on the programme with the to the community framework for equal opportunities the women and men the like i my fully support express the equality between women and men if the the relevant commission com however at the the the impression that the financial memorandum also financing the the current costs the the currently with line a financed european lobby the
you will the know that the committee to the conclusion is has that this ngos a monopoly is
from the letters the several european disincentives that that there not many organisations are the the ideological represented feel by this monopoly
this this ngos a important role plays the the model and implementation the this programme is i i the integrity the this community framework for equal opportunities between women and men doubtful become therefore is this unacceptable
is the further the appropriate to a monopoly to finance with a line the intended is to equality to promote
should we all a monopoly finance with the community budget with what postal than also
to my sorry i i here against must vote
resolution álvarez a
mr the president there are different reasons why i against the resolution álvarez i voted because i however but a minute i for this vote mention i there but a
when i for this partsession to strasbourg left was i the the airport by a large number people  the was also a older pensioner women
unfortunately was they serious physical disabled if result the a extremely unsafe product that in the european union in circulation was
the my departure i i its said concerned you not concern this time deal we the resolution álvarez and that is now precisely on product
my party has serious reserved the regard the community legislation for the sale the attractive this goes in against the concept the mutual recognition the standards
therefore are we principle against the original directive and can we nor enlargement of accept
even if this not as would are would we still still serious reserved have
the commission says although that its proposal for general product a revision is the directive eec and that the in the original directive result approach not is amended but this seems not whole where to are
what us with particularly prolonging is that as commissioner byrne clear has made the commission the plan is a network the with enforcement responsible authorities in to to to the implementation the this legislation to facilitate
since we experience have with networks in other community initiatives is this for us the beginning the something  namely the a uniform allocations the the legislation which a european service for enforcement the the area the requesting the  from shares
us i is the the to a general trend now the commission the member with laws has phenomenon start they interest and i i work interest to who for the 
that is the only reason why my party against this proposal
i give although my support the this report on general product but we must the careful that we not to far to
the is important that our products safe are but we should not with extremely act to the other on reconcile
the people in very europe are deeply concerned on the safety the attractive and rightly
in this report the pleased expressed on the improvement the the current european legislation on product but according i must the directive not the application are the shops the charitable the a typical accompany are the the british social life
the is absurd to think that the average  the authorities information can provide on the risk programmes and the origin the the manufacturers articles the he the jan and street buy
let we not forget that the amendments which was the the exception the this shops from were the mr whitehead i i must we him the congratulate
this  were suddenly in the way because the the the european mainland here total not bowis the had
thanks the amendments the labour can the  relieved breathe they will least be the the directive
the general objective the the directive is very important this like the a consistent high level the consumer and a good force the the internal market assure
i am the the much i agree with the to to clear down comprehensible warnings against possible risk programmes this must be made the products and the this where they sold be
clear labelling is the best way to concerned consumers reassure to to and them to assure that the products the they buy safe are
the confidence the the public in the safety the the by us all can products has the last years a long tomorrow behind after heated fear was the by with particularly dangerous toys
only if our attitude characterised the by safety over everything and if the attitude also visible the can we the confidence the the public restore and the safety the our children assure
lagendijk a
mr the president the was a justified wish the the council to the aid the the european union the the countries the the balkans to rationalise and time also the european bureau for the reconstruction the kosovo to reform which the powers the the bureau gradually would can be extended to the whole region
we are the fully with this alternative agree and with the two proposals the the council the there specific content the give but we can not agree with the amendments the the european parliament the the balance in the system completely want change the favour the the commission
currently the the bureau for kosovo run by a council the management which the representatives the the member and the commission any a voice have and decisions with twothirds majority be taken
the commission is very unfortunate on this situation which they under monitoring the the member the and they complain the on the fact that the enormous weight the the member a obstacle is for its freedom and therefore also according its for the efficiency the the aid
the european parliament has the call the are old ally heard and just voted for amendments the the commission right give
amendment the for to the management the the bureau on to to the the commission the this responsible would are the the european parliament
amendment weakened the position the the council the management the the commission by to determine that decisions in the council be taken the ordinary majority
amendment extends the tasks from the the replaces by the commission controlled bureau
amendment finally the the commission free stake on the  in the bureau what we very worrying find
the is therefore again the based scenario the believe that the commission the external aid better will manage if they has on more powers more autonomy and less controlled the by the member
that is a mistake the unfortunately enough can lead to the type problems that we but already to good know
we questions other that the member the power retain on the management the the aid and on the bureau
one can they the a better control exercise and hand can they ensure for the conservation the a essential link between the european aid and the national policies in this vulnerable region
mr the president if member the the european party and if member the the italian party the the pensioners i i like for this important report on assistance for albania croatia bosnia montenegro serbia and kosovo and the management of voted
this assistance will especially must to to let see that europe there is and expression to give the the solidarity with the population the the victims is the wars especially for elderly and disabled has that to a hope misery and poverty led
they must therefore if first but together with the others be help a such plan support i course the i
mr the president i i for the report voted although the kosovo serbia and montenegro not clear enough the other be reform
president kostunica additional the recently in a interview like with general the de compare but general the de could only a large role to play after he the problems with algeria had resolved
i think that kosovo the algeria the serbia is
kosovo has there right the independent and in cooperation with are neighbours on are future to can decide
we must president rugova and president kostunica therefore the opportunity give if democrats with other to negotiate
therefore must there soon elections be taken in kosovo and must both sides if partners work and a solution for the region find
the enlargement the the activities the the european bureau for the reconstruction to the area the the federal republic the yugoslavia had already many earlier must done this had also not linked should be the the changes in this country
for the isolation the health the international aid and the difficult situation after the war have not milosevic and are staff the who must pay but the citizens and especially the least privileged citizens
perhaps will the with the simplification the the procedure the institution the decentralised operational units and not only in pristina because pristina is themselves the yugoslavia and the solution the the from the double structure council the administration and commission arising problems closer in the near to the a solution for the enormous bureaucratic shortcomings where the european bureau for the reconstruction under its is
apart of must the however
the financial resources for this area increase the european union was both in equipment and moral respect the  to the damages damage
the local authorities a voice in the  give they are  made by the bureaucracy and the different european  and
cooperation programmes between the former enemies and the different countries in this area the established to
i am pleased on this report this the tried the clean the the federal republic the yugoslavia to improve by the decisionmaking to simplify and transparent to make
 a
mr the president i i for the  voted also already contains the many gaps and lack where the party the the pensioners not behind the
i question the commission than also other new proposals in to must to the serious problems in the agriculture and the farming the to solve
we can not continue the farmers the aid the the european union need have and the aid is more than welcome the the to now to usual way to help because the is only but damage done
the quotas must absolutely be abolished we must the agriculture the fisheries and the farming in the european union the a other way help
sv we give not support the new subsidies for the  and therefore vote we against the report
the danish social vote against a report that the introduction the eu for  the
the commission like a system for  introduce by the up the a  in the member
the proposal is unnecessary and harmful because the support the given the a sector the to still to without support good results 
the crisis in the pig has itself thanks the market resolved exactly because there not unnecessary and expensive aid were
with this report like the parliament still more aid introduce
the producers would support from the fund to to their production in to down and the eu must the aid authorise
we vote therefore both against the proposal the the commission if against the report the the parliament
if the report on the common organisation for pork the adopted is the over the the enormous  which the legislation for the common agricultural is through
the is odd that the rapporteur the the if favour the the market however has on the cyclical fluctuations the the market for pork the ambition consequences the same market responsible the for the disastrous spectacle in the sector
we are against the market the a just rather if dangerous instrument is to the economy to regulate both the economy if whole if the production the pork
we are the not agree with the cynicism which the rapporteur the good old time regrets when by the stop the the activities in small production the price could be restore
we are the still less agree with the way which he the bankruptcies the small sourced argument to the the european institutions additional financial support to questions for the large 
we must indeed prevent that the producers the victims be the cyclical fluctuations the the market
the only real producers are however those the work in the  and the  way the this like say small farmers and workers in the livestock in not case are the those the the report mainly like support and the only invest in this sector to the to nothing with the subsidies the the european institutions

pt the longterm crisis which the products the the eu the victims are been shows the that we urgent need have the a indepth reform the the com in the sector pork
the proposal the the commission to a only by the producers financed optional  in the life to to is not only incompatible with the principle the financial solidarity the the cap but bears also no the the the solution the the  which the sector to camps has
in the  the tried the proposal the a number points to improve there the an to a compromise with the council with particularly what the financial participation the the fund the
we are us there however the aware that the commission this proposals rejected and that they in the council despite the relative openness the the french presidency this not majority will find
therefore is the the fundamental important that we continue fight for the up the a compulsory fund which also the cap part and which the granted sums be yes so so possible producers there use the can make the is in this the essential that the fund especially the small and mediumsized farmers the good is
what the community participation the the fund the must said to be that the in the  down proposal the position the the commission considerably improves we to there however not that agreement that this participation the broaches the a moreover in the framework the agenda rejected principle the cofinancing the the cap
i think that no the us will combat that the producers the pork from all member the the eu the last two year a crisis have human the for many the them disastrous consequences has had
we have not organisation for pork as we the for other agricultural have
this want we in principle also nothing change
despite must there be in if in a certain sector large structural changes have place as in the sector pork is happened and the prices during many longer time than previously with are fallen
no can there important the have that with particularly the smaller pig the must give because they such persistent  not competitive
the is therefore justified the existing community regulations the this area to change
if there than however funds for  must to can cofinancing by the community certainly be considered because this not as been the the community budget move if some say
i i therefore for the report voted
the proposal the the commission is in being a recognition the the fact that the current instruments for the organisation some
the last crisis was extremely serious and has very long took
they has a many holdings do disappear and many young farmers in the problems the
the absence the a regulatory system would this development the large and integrated companies in the card plays only but strengthen
we can impossible the farmers questions that they in their cannot a additional effort make many the them are already appropriate the 
we are the opinion that we they must support by effective instruments to create not only to crises the to solve but also to the markets better to control the quality to promote and products to promote
currently is the  still still a mainly family activity based the responsibility
the is a sector the a fulcrum is for the economic life the the rural often in regions the not only alternative offer
we have elected to us in to to for the conservation the a loud and avilés rural the conservation the the central and small or the now is to holdings small or industrial companies is the pillar the 
the proposal for the up the a  for the  as amended the the free market not the discussion but makes the protection possible the companies the answer the the model the farm
the market for pork is 
a low crop the the supply is enough to a crisis to cause
the crises take the last years however longer and have serious consequences for with particularly young and small sourced
rightly looking the commission to solutions to the income the sourced safe to to
unfortunately lead the before proposal the the commission not to structural solutions and believes rapporteur garot that the again time is to the old socialist horse the strong interventionists the stable to to
the has not sense to funds to means the the consequences the still repeated crises effects
the risk there that a such fund by are  nature the periods the the crises only but longer makes
further offers the fund in the form the cofinancing the the member the possibility more or less hidden aid to to
countries in the union the always strong are been with support can of use make to competition to provided
that lead to situation which george orwellian in the eleven official languages the the union quoted the t  verifiable equal but   verifiable accept equal  
but even if the cofinancing from the proposal from the is the proposed fund still not in the to something the the frequency and depth the crises in the sector to do
the falling prices must the production back
that is a natural response in the 
a fund will than nothing the if the not binding is both if not all participants the make to the production to to
to this reasons have we against the proposal voted
services is the key in the crises in the pig
i hope than also that the council critical just with this report and the opinion the dutch  the i the
this farmers in first body opposed the a  believe that if the council a such fund allow this must done under condition the services per member
 a
mr the president i am critical if there decisions on the relations between the european union and turkey taken must be
i i although for voted but i like however few points to the to the we to my opinion in this situation always in mind must the
in the first place has europe not asked to part from to make the turkey but is the turkey that a application has tabled to to to act to the european union turkey must the therefore adapt and the legislation the the european union accept
in the second place the turkey not more only the greece but take turkey now the whole european union the the
greece is not more in the opportunity to here are own rights and own interests to defend but the must by the whole european union be defended
mr the president i i for voted and i am met that a amendment is adopted which the genocide the the  people the recognised
the sorry i other that by i tabled amendments which i the principle the the selfdetermination the peoples had stressed not are adopted
in this parliament the as often on rights about yesterday is the charter adopted but when the is is this rights also really to to apply not agree in the practice but the least they to emphasise is this parliament the a vibrant way the are considering back and that is certainly not practises
mr the president the genocide the the armenia was the first the a series  in the st century the the century the the genocide can be mentioned
franz  has this with are the forty days the   a without  up
franz  had jewish and  families
the jewish families were the victims the the holocaust the  families including the jews under them were after the second war from  driven
the that how a disaster to the next can lead
when hitler the holocaust being said he who has the now still on the armenia
we had our turkish friends there therefore the point that injustice also now not can be spiralled
we want not saline in historic crisis you but we want injustice together processing in whose name that also is committed
despite all shortcomings is the report the the mr morillon many better than the proposal the the commission for the partnership between the european union and turkey
the is a good matter that in the report the referred to the  and the judgement the the european court the the rights the the human in strasbourg
we are also welcome with the reference to the  issue although this not enough the had in clear very the turkey must demands that the the genocide the the armenia recognises but perhaps can the this still correct by means the the amendments
the is also a good matter that the referred to the issue the the kurds and the minorities in the proposal the the commission on the partnership the on because in all languages question
this where the report the the mr morillon however strong to briefly inadequate is in the treatment the the relations between greece and turkey
the european parliament would the turkish government clear must make that if they very the way to europe like make they a end must make the the sovereign the the borders between the member the the european union and its disputes must present the the international court the justice in den hague
that is also in the important the the turkish people that like the peaceful way with are neighbours 
adoption the the resolution means support the a step forward in compared with the proposal adoption means however not that we the fully with the commission agree are
the is a good matter that the european parliament the opinion on the progress the turkey the the way to accession with particularly if the is to the respect the the human
since sweden not prepared is part to take the a joint military defence but the the civil crisis can we paragraph according what the parliament pleased is that turkey the like help to the to to the the improvement the the european capacity in the framework the the european security and defence not support
the  on the accession the turkey to the european union like especially the turkish government remind remind that they the turkish market still more must opening for the european capital and the by on to to to structural reforms as the dismantling the aid the revision the the pension and the up the the privatisation with other words by the resources for the social policy back to under and the living the the poorest areas the the population to let worse
the the area the the human limited the report the to the turkish government the to encourage to ask to better to do without that the european countries ever with measures risk already was the but the end the arms
or the rapporteur or the european governments behind him want the military the in reality turkey govern and a part the the country issues the the state for the head any
the european governments want the turkish reactionary parties the refuse the death the to abolish and the human the women with being act not against the in the hand present just blind if the turkish authorities the today the kurds suppress after first the armenia to have eradicate
who only view has for free movement the capital and goods and not for lives and human must but for this report vote
we have exceed
gentlemen colleagues this is not the at to crisis from the past the still long not  are open to 
the is not the at to ancestral can the to flames or the to encourage to intolerance as i here and this i hear do in this parliament
the commitment is not agree the recognition the the genocide the the  people since us parliament the in the past already on this issue has can express with particularly in are resolution the june
what the european members in have asked the turkey is the courage to the view to open for are past order to the future to can look
the historic truth is a guarantee for the democracy and can or must not subordinate be made the private financial or economic interests or the now is to individuals governments or states
on the truth and the memory the not negotiated
the enough to remind what there happened is with germany that the shoah has recognised and after the second war a large democratic country is become
that wish we today again and therefore demands we that in the  referred the to the genocide
the recognition the the genocide must a order are for the new  and turkish generations to with other in dialogue to act
the whole  community and the children the the armenia the in the beginning the the century to our countries are emigrants expect today a act the justice
they want their  the the victims are become the the genocide a moral funeral give
now the last testify the the  exile the last survived the the  slowly extinction is the more to more our task no our duty to the remind the the  genocide loud to the
but addition the duty the the collective memory the the any democracy must impose and which the europeans know how difficult and embarrassing this is as difficult that some european countries there still not at ready that are is the the important that such barbaric acts the the universal awareness clashes and which lives be destroyed to ethnic religious or cultural reasons the never more arise
this is the message the europe must europe
the the european council the helsinki in december has the european union decided to turkey the status the candidate the the european union to to know and also a accession and one only financial framework in to to to the candidacy the turkey to support so the progress can make in agreement with the criteria the copenhagen
the clearly themselves that the negotiations not the start can to as turkey not the this criteria meets and this must we continue remind
the is therefore clear that the reports the the european commission very important are
we discuss today on the report the
just if the rapporteur must we admit that turkey the certain areas progress has made and that there good signals are
i think in the first place the the reopening the the political dialogue in the association the the april after three year adjournment is met and the up the eight subcommittees the responsible are with the the the the priorities the the adoption the the acquis community also the signature by turkey the august and september the four important treaties the the united nations the respectively the have the political civil social and cultural rights and the as quickly possible must be ratified to the human and the democratic pluralism in turkey to guarantee the adoption by the turkish ministers the the report that is tabled by the turkish coordination high council for the human and that will must if reference and working for the further work already must there still specific measures the protection the the rights the minorities in be included finally the adoption the a law the the has the the suspension the from and penalties against press and 
the many areas are the progress however inadequate if there already there is the progress
i think example the the health the a law on the abolition the the death the issue cyprus and the occupation by the turkish army the a third the the island cyprus and the problem the the rights the ethnic minorities as the kurds or the armenia
in that the i i my support given the a amendment that in the report a reference like let into to the genocide the the  people the is important that this historic fact the recognised
i request the turkish authorities same to do that would a large step mean in the direction the the democratic development the the country
if turkey negotiations like to must the first still very large efforts make
if the like join to the union must the all values accept the the essence the europe of
and perhaps will the again the question must to or turkey really sense has to member to be the the european union or that the perhaps would with other countries the the east a integrated whole is that closely linked is with the european union the the area the trade and economy the safety and stability and the the level the the human and the democratic rules
this is course a very another debate than that the today but because the important that i importance the turkey wanted i the today however still agree say
together with my mr programmes i i against this amendment voted because leyla zana itself that not the to insist the a special treatment or the rapid release from the prison
they like that the criminal the amended and that want we also
also are we the opinion that not only the kurdish prisoners but all political prisoners must be released
i i for the resolution voted
the am i that the european parliament the openly has expressed for a call to the turkish government and the national turkish assembly to the genocide the the  minority the has place for the creation the a modern the in turkey openly to recognise
since has us parliament the used for the recognition the the genocide and the adoption the this amendment late see that the parliament this debate coherent approach
this resolution the however not answer the a important question what borders want we now really for the european union
perhaps is there a at which the european union the further to the east under by accession the the ukraine and russia
than is the for the hand to means turkey the opportunity to give
that at is far way
the current turkey is a authoritarian the with military majeure political prisoners censorship  border and a system that minorities does
from the millions the s year ago the the rebellious armenia are still still not the right lessons drawn
that is a the the reasons why the the normal take that now still still a other national minority the its rights the deprived
the kurds be moved bombed and oppressed while their language is excluded the use in administration education and media
turkey must first learn from the history the greece serbia bulgaria albania syria iraq and 
the countries were used to the turkish territory and repeatedly were this  violence oppressed
because the population not more the obstacles in the exercise the its selfdetermination is this now peace possible
i i not the illusion that the way which turkey run the will change by this country under flexible conditions the membership the the eu in the prospect to to
the necessary change can not the outside be bought the the today but must the from to
turkey must as quickly possible part to of the the european union
that will not only a positive influence have the the fight against the fundamentalism and the peace but also the the development and the balance between the countries in north and southern
unfortunately are many conflicts on the kurdish and  community and on the respect the the rights still not resolved although there the this area many progress are made
the dignity the peoples and the respect the traditions are fundamental principles the the union the union can not only but danger make on the kurds and the armenia
they must more the initiative take and the accession the turkey take if a necessary geopolitical strategy
therefore have we the turkish government again asked its responsibility for the eradication the the  people officially to recognise
a such statement is a moral and historic obligation and is a essential step for accession to the union
the members the the national alliance the the in the past already for the accession the turkey to the union had expressed will the therefore today abstained the vote if signal the the turkish government and the turkish people that they quickly a solution must seek for this problems
we be faced with a even risk the silent
we should the atrocities the the history not forget if we not want that they again done
the genocide the the  people is a the the atrocities and a such suffering can not production be if the not the recognised
the recognition the the  genocide is a recognition the the human dignity
the deportation the the whole  people to the teeming the  the within the at  the the armenia from  the execution the healthy men the  the women children and elderly the hundreds kilometres to footing had make without care without eat and way were deprived there and killed the deportation the armenia from  and  in the murder the   in byzantium the eradication the more than a million armenia in something more than a year this like say almost the half the the  population in turkey that can we not forget
from all taken is same suffering the the  population to the
i remind the the resolution the which turkey was asked the  genocide to recognise if condition for accession to the european union
i i for the amendments voted the today this recognition demands to the  continue to to and the suffering the a people to recognise
turkey will more for the international community before when the accept the on are past to the
what the  us late see is start the fact that we still still the negative consequences affected the the absurd decision the the european summit the helsinki to turkey the equal footing with poland to as if a full european country that preordained is to to to act to the european union with all practical consequences the this linked are preaccession etc
i quote again literally the text the the conclusions the the presidency the paragraph turkey is a candidate the preordained is to to the union to to act the basis the same criteria if the what for the other countries apply
everyone know that this decision extremely hypocritical is
how than also the machinery that the in the has the does are work and will are logic continue impose until the situation such unsustainable the that they inevitably end in a deep and serious crisis the our relations with turkey
but will some say meantime can we as long possible the the at enjoy the conditions controls and the criteria the copenhagen at enlargement to the at from to to which we with turkey will must negotiate on the free movement the workers
such progress are both europe if turkey worthy
we are the the the large turkish nation and the large turkish people compulsory to they the a fair and respect way to deal and not with schizophrenic chinese to speak what only but lead to bitter disappointment and unacceptable humiliation
the is at not the intention to turkey far the europe to the as cohnbendit that
the is only but to the the that by are location and history the current turkey not european country is
in place the the reality to reject is the precisely to a absolutely respect for the dignity the the turkish people by the not a the behaviour the to to and together to to to reinforced cooperation
the ambiguity the the process from the development the a real cooperation between turkey and europe the basis the healthy and clear principles while there however a important common important there to together to work with turkey that by are enormous influence and weight by the privileged links the the now has with the  countries the asia a powerful stabilising factor is in a region the this large need the has
behalf the labour in the european parliament am i my pleased from on the report the the mr morillon
according us must turkey just as dealt be if each another candidate
although there not doubt on there that turkey still not meets the the criteria the copenhagen must we with him work so this objective can be achieved that have we also with all other countries done
we can not time new obstacles raise the are way
therefore also have we us opposition against the amendment on the genocide the the armenia
the event dates from the time the the  rich
for far i i can remind is not few event during the british  ever a obstacle been for the accession the the united kingdom
consistent and honest action must the distinctive are the our its with indifferent what candidate
 peres a
they make the many ensure on the bse and know the this report the the mr jové peres which he rightly out that we not can control how  in a the area fish and how in a another therefore have they i asked the commission that attention to make that the a good idea would are this  with a satellite from to rest
many car programmes have a such system
the union can as cross how  in a the part the the sea active are and how in a another and prevent that there to many the numbers also fish want namely like a calm life lead and their pension to
we have against the  peres voted on the participation the the european community the regional organisations because the report favour for a transfer the national sovereignty the completely counterproductive would are
since several years i i if member the the delegation for the relations with canada can see how such regional organisation work the is more the to the nafo organisation for the northwest part the the atlantic atlantic which all countries the this region participate as canada and all countries the in this area use the traditional fishing including france spain and still a few other european countries
any member has in principle on one voice in the decisionmaking
since the european countries however decided have to this issue to misguided and the only to let represent by the commission have they together still only on one voice
therefore is the first result the the association the our forces that we the six vote are dropped to one
together have the european countries therefore same vote if example cuba
this situation concern the federalists not few concern they to that from that we more are when the commission with one voice clearly
unfortunately enough is the here to one voice in all  the the floor
also the our position often weakened by internal mechanisms with particularly our yet the a ex agreed smallest lowest lowest
on the whole taken be our interests damaged they be not with sufficient force defended and the role the the commission there there mainly in that they if a when so on the compliance by the member the the binding decisions the sometimes against their like in the on regional organisation are taken
the  peres like this situation not only systematically enlargement to all existing and still the to up regional organisations but still strengthen by a end to make the the habit the the commission to a appeal to do the the support the experts from the different member
according the report must the commission for the tasks staff recruit and corresponding appropriations allocated to
we can not few the this there accept
we are the opinion that the current system the representation by the commission us not more but weaker makes and we expect that any european the fully represented remains in the regional organisations already is the course desirable that the member their positions between coordinate
although the report the the mr jové peres supposedly a  is is here according i a many rejecting matter behind find
the is example the next passage for the development the a really fisheries requires that the powers for the exercise the monitoring the the fishing the the commission be granted
than follows the comment by a lack the suitable human and negation resources be powers the the commission transferred the the member which the like say that this situation not to in the indefinitely can continue
the answer the the rapporteur this is that the community actually the resources must to to direct control from to exercise the the monitoring the the fisheries
this is the truth therefore from the lending the european union like simply still more powers to the missions until they a ever superstate is become
they will only satisfied are if its own fleet with  and the flag with the fifteen stars ensure the the respect the its fisheries
my party can not support give the this report
the european fisheries the in this period faced with a series challenges if result the the dismissing competition by the globalisation the the market for fish
also growing the need to the marine environment to protect and the resources sensible to manage
therefore must the international cooperation be improve and the community more help the legislation for the management the the resources
the most means to to to to a reinforced cooperation are the regional organisations  programmes they play a key the the international stage but have not sufficient staff for a adequate representation the the community
the  programmes are thanks their regional model particularly suitable to the objectives to achieve but they are with particularly important for a sensible management the the resources which the specific characteristics the the fishing in eight be taken
the  programmes play a important role in the future common fisheries therefore and because the different  powers and development the each the them must the community the adapt the their characteristics and its role within the thirty existing  programmes harmonise so their recommendations more in the community can be included
without to want back the the excellent argument the my friend gallagher on the text the in vote is the would i the debate want enlargement to all cases which our countries represented be by the commission the international negotiations
what i i say has course the the the subject that us today concerns the representation the the european community in regional organisations but is just the application the the negotiations the example be held in the framework the the world
if the commission the power has to the community to represent and to negotiate in a international organisation is this because they this a mandate has been the the council
therefore is the necessary that the duration and the content the this mandate clear defined are and the council closely ensure the the implementation that
the a number issues with particularly the fisheries in some parts the the world are the interests the the member very different
some member have at nothing to make with certain 
the is therefore absolutely necessary that member the the directly involved are their interests can defend by itself present to are the the negotiations the commission can they the useful way help by technical support to to
if only the european interests be represented by a commission the all power to the to form will the influence and the weight the europe in this organisations only but weaken
europe would in fact still only on one seat have and only one position defend the the the smallest lowest lowest the the basis the a group member the very different interests have
what we therefore not must do is admit the the  the the commission and the position the europe weaken what completely would contrary against a right application the the subsidiarity
contrary the all international negotiations where the european union party is must the role the the commission carefully be  they must under not circumstances a replacement role play but must the involved member the to are by a support and coordination task to role
i am there not at certainly the that this the way is the the summit the nice like follow but the member have still the time to to reflection to to
this are we the end the the vote has
i thank those the to the end are has
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
incineration the waste
the the item is the report a the the mr blokland on the by the conciliation approved common text the the directive the the european parliament and the council on the incineration the waste c cod
president when i three year ago was appointed to rapporteur for the amendment the a directive on the incineration the dangerous waste could i not suspicion what this from would say
a small  was end a has work by the together in one directive the dangerous and  waste
my suggestion to together was supported by the then presidentinoffice trittin and by the european commission so the decision the the parliament to three directives together to add not the many opposition lot
with this together was the community legislation streamlined
less successful were the with the majority the the amendments the the european parliament from the first reading the not by the council were accepted
a  european parliament limited the in second reading to the adopt the sixteen amendments
already quickly was that conciliation need was because the council not the prohibit was this amendments to accept
order a precious and them official depth to prevent are informal negotiations opened to to see or a compromise could be achieved
the willingness the the european parliament to the procedure to up relatively the flexibility the the council
this was a discussion because the different positions
end is there after hard negotiations a result achieved that the worth is to defend
if rapporteur i i that with full conviction
the whole period i i good can work with the representatives the the council and with the european commission and was i i supported by the environment and its secretariat
this like i all you thank
i like still one time a three reasons mention why the directive incineration as important is
the first the  but also the emissions the other dangerous substances the drastically reduced
the second there is a many better access to information on incinerators for the public
the third there is a considerably less unequal treatment the incinerators and plants for coincineration the waste as kilns
but already am i than positive on the result the this directive that can not hide that incineration the waste a solution is
we are there than because not in managed waste to prevent and reuse is us also not managed
fortunately is there there the technological progress the must with particularly used be for sustainability
i mention a example pvc includes the the total amount incinerated waste
according the green the the european commission is the incineration the pvc waste a number problems the
we must not hesitate the problems carefully the to tackle
sustainable technology can us the help
finally i expect that we on a few year the  further will can strengthen in closely consultation with the business
the  citizens will us there grateful for are
mr the president i am the with the rapporteur the mr blokland in any case on one thing agree incineration is perhaps a important shipwrecks but today are incinerators still still necessary this only a very low percentage the the waste built the
this issue does the now more to  for in the light the the current problems with meal that destroyed will must be and which we later in the afternoon still will must talk
this proposal that three directives on the incineration the waste like replace has to objective the quality the the air the water the on and the human health to improve by the emissions the polluting substances the result the incineration and coincineration to reduce with particularly the dioxin  and heavy metals
also makes this proposal the integration in the policy possible the the technical progress the since the years s are achieved
the result the the conciliation is therefore on the whole taken very satisfactory
the values for the emissions the incinerators and plants for coincineration are closer the other the although account is taken with the technical differences between this two activities
i am the always agree been with the common approach to this two systems not if competitors to see but if complementary methods
both are essential become
moreover can we the together the this two methods for the incineration the dangerous and  waste only but regret this has the debate extremely difficult and i i here always against protests
the working seems i not the good to are the seems i not desirable that we the such issues the this way to work to
nevertheless is this third reading satisfactory because they the conditions for the to the  up
our group the confusion between dangerous and  waste wanted avoid stated that the current text clear provides in different procedures for the inclusion and treatment the waste
they are namely adapted the the type waste that processed must be and for in additional precautions for dangerous waste
i conclude mr the president with to say that the group satisfied is with the work that during this third reading is done
mr the president to to start deserve the mr blokland the commission and the council our thank for their cooperation on this directive
we know all that the together the all rules on incineration a long and difficult process was both what the dangerous if nonhazardous waste
i like like three important objectives the we with this directive can achieve to the to
first and especially is now a important step the to the emissions the dangerous and pollutants substances the incineration to reduce the is to substances the very harmful are for the human health and the environment
in the directive be standards the for plants and emission for heavy metals dioxin and other substances
that the not purely more to emissions in the air is but also to discharges in water and earth is a new  element
the second point that i like because is that the citizens now better information be on the emissions the incinerators with the introduction the compulsory annual reports
the mr blokland had the here also on and i think this a important result
the citizens have right the information on such things
to finally hope i that we with the the the common standards which everyone the must to the the supposedly unjustified can combat
the will economic given not more as attractive are to waste to other places in the union to to where the rules on germane more are
as the mr blokland already said is incineration far the the most ideal way the waste
the is matter further to invest in better production reuse and recycling
this methods must the prefer to to over incineration
the is however a good matter that we the rules for incineration now up have
i think that this a important contribution for the environment will are
mr the president also i like the mr blokland thank for the prepare the this important matter
the drafting the the directive was a difficult process because the circumstances and practices in the member differences what the influence is the many groups
we have now if result a reasonable balanced proposal that strict borders the the the incineration the both dangerous if nonhazardous waste the situation the the environment improves and use the waste the the production the electricity and heat possible makes
a the the difficult affairs was the defining the the socalled coincineration
in some countries is the also for the environment the best if the carefully separate flammable waste can incineration in small local plants the electricity and heat produce
the the first design for the plants were unnecessary technical expensive and partially impossible measurements called
during the reading is the proposal better become
the is also the important that the industry for its own production still still nonhazardous waste can use
the problem was to my opinion also that in the directive to strong the entered the small technical details which also experts the difficult agree can be
the parliament must the to my opinion to to the set the the main so the member account can the with the different circumstances and by can to with the for the environment best practices
the  increase the costs the the incineration the waste but reduce the harmful emissions and improves the situation the the environment
the reading in the parliament underpins a reasonable balanced proposal the that if basis must for the act in the whole european union
mr the president i like like the mr blokland the i congratulate with the excellent work that he for this report has done behalf my group can i support express the the text
by the up the the legislation on rather is the amount waste the the incinerated considerably has from own experience in my constituency in wales know i that when the to the consequences for the health and the environment is incineration the dangerous and nondangerous waste just so ensure concern if helps
we must see to prevent that the one form the unsafe and little sustainable  the replace by a other
incineration is not recycling
incineration is not clean and safe method the waste
there must sought be to really sustainable alternatives therefore must many more money be into in research to and development the prevention reuse and recycling the waste
i am than also welcome with this standards for coincineration the  and the transport the waste the will the a contribution can make the the end the the current  which areas with the costly companies and the lowest standards the  the europe be
i am with particularly pleased on the promise to improvement the the access the the public to information on incinerators and the obligation for employers the incinerators to a annual  to publish
more openness is the people the in the near the incinerators live course after the the heart but more openness will there also to can lead that employers the incinerators there itself for ensure that they below the the  continue
the introduction the more values for we for new coincinerators as kilns is also a step forward this will a incentive are to emissions still further to reduce although the proposed standards not reflects are the the best available technology
on the whole taken will the with this needed legislation the worst consequences the incineration for the health and the environment can to i hope that the any incentive to with incineration profits to make which the on will are the agree still greater  will be these
mr the president i like especially the mr blokland thank for the cooperation during this procedure
the make the agreements on exceptions the the scope the the directive was a the the difficult issues during the reading and the conciliation
the objective was to to to strictly  exceptions and as clear possible provisions
this is the to my opinion in insofar in managed that the environmental and the compatibility with the other community policy easy can be achieved
the parliament has also an to more openness and a better access the the public to information
therefore could the the the conciliation amount that the plants the more than two tonnes per at incineration a annual on the emissions the the plant must publish and that the smaller incinerators the public lists be placed
the emission the in the annex the the directive are were certainly the difficult point the the directive
also what that the was the the conciliation a good result achieved when the proposal the the parliament to the most strict emission to to apply for the emissions the  the all new kilns the waste credibility was approved
i am there itself in managed few changes in the report to to the the vital are for the continuation the the already years ago in finland introduced  the more are than the now good to approve directive
i am this especially pleased on because my task if new member that directly the the second reading was involved not easy was
the report the the mr blokland on the third reading was for many members the the environment the for the first time in the parliament are elected same a first test which the the the practices the the parliament own could make
the in the bodies elected procedures work however astonishing good
the result can the with right if good finance
a important share the was however play for the specific like the all three the institutions to together to work
the approach the the portuguese and the french presidency was constructive and especially the role the the commission must be mentioned the commission has the decisive way contributed the the the the a good result
to my opinion must the this for the future learn from draw the must ensure for good cooperation and the for a good force the a environmentallyfriendly european union
mr the president gentlemen members the mr blokland in the particularly my me for the fact that i few minutes to late am
i i your introduction missed but i can the councils what there is said
to to start thank i you for the excellent work that you if rapporteur for this report you done
the fact that the directive as smoothly by the legislative is  shows the the how important this for all involved is
despite the fact that the extent the the incineration the next years will increase will this directive contribute to a considerable reduction the the emissions the different pollutants substances in the whole european union
as the mr lund already said bears this directive not only the the the fight the pollution this its also the problem the the water that released the the such the exhaust and the quality the the after incineration  waste
the slowed is difficult has but we are to a balanced compromise has and the amendments the the parliament and the council have end a better directive has
this is now many more what its scope the
there is a better access the the public to information
the emission for new kilns which waste the likening are strengthened as mrs evans already said
this have we mainly to thank the the excellent work the the european parliament and the rapporteur the mr blokland
i am that convinced that the farreaching measures and the legitimate interests the all involved parties in the common text the balanced way the other are between this opinion was also yesterday in your speeches to the
i remind you remind that the directive not the only instrument is in the policy the the commission for management
in the hierarchy is incineration the last stage the waste the commission will than also everything in the work to to waste to to and to recycling and to to to a integrated 
our first objective is course the prevent the scrap
short this directive is a important contribution to the reduction the the negative consequences for the environment and the the arising dangers for the health
thank you mrs the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
supplementary insurance
the the item is the report a the the mr rocard behalf the commission employment and social affairs on the supplementary insurance ini
mr the president ladies and gentlemen the community institutions work now already almost ten year long the the issue the the social protection which the modernise course a important element is
although the member course their own responsibilities retain the on the the direct application the the subsidiarity are they that aware that the common problems a debate the european level necessary make
the social systems are because general developments the direct consequences have for their force the is here not only to the consequences the twentyfive year weak economic growth the unemployment and social exclusion has caused and the  has chipped but also to the consequences the the ageing and the turnout the new diseases and finally to the consequences the the progress the the area the research and medical treatment what has led to a increase the the 
how different the national situations also should are in all member the the european union to we the that the compulsory modernise general decrease socalled supplementary  still important be and discriminatory factors be strengthened
in this context seemed i a more general approach the the modernise necessary which course account must to be taken with the institutional context this means that the member responsible are for the organisation and the financing the the systems that account must to be taken with the characteristics the the national social models and their historic background and free competition the  must determine
the european citizens must access have to appropriate and quality quality care within a reasonable term that is a priority objective which the activities and the financing the the compulsory and supplementary systems joint must to
basis the the principle that any individual right has the medical care and health a social good is what any member access must guarantee will the future unacceptable are that some citizens outside the narrow the that would terrible situation cause with disastrous consequences for our companies
the council the ministers the employment and social affairs has the october on in luxembourg unanimously a european strategy adopted for the fight against social exclusion
in the charter the the fundamental the the union that officially will be  the the summit the nice the the right the social security and health recognised if a common revision
for the european parliament will the a  are ensure to ensure that in name the the fight against discrimination and social exclusion and with respect the a everyone responsibility a strong impetus the given the the the the a package which the essential principle the solidarity hard can be made
therefore i i the economic and social committee to opinion asked this opinion mr the president mrs the commissioner has for many clarification taken and is included in a communication the with majority majority is adopted
the opinion the the economic and monetary commission and the proposals the its rapporteur ioannis marinos have the given to many debates and the adoption the several 
finally is also a broad consensus achieved in the commission employment and social affairs which i the honour i president to are
the proposed package has several perspective the first both is the development the a common vision on universal  which access to essential  within reasonable term possible the
the second both is the institution the community monitoring the health and the their ability to to meet the the needs this the in that the similar statistical data must data to cooperation must to and good practices must exchange
with this monitoring would the a already made community bureau can taxation through enlargement the are tasks
the third both is the presentation by the european commission within a term the six months this will very what work require mrs the commissioner the a green which research the done to a framework for supplementary  and relevant initiatives be proposed
with particularly will a proposal for a recommendation must be done on the next elements recognition by the member the a common definition the the understanding universal  which the services is down which any european citizens access the to the necessary care the the in consultation with the private insurance the a guarantee for the compliance the the principle on nondiscrimination the creating the a collective insurance for the care the people and groups the people the suffering the serious diseases and the encourage the the private insurance to the development the prevention
further must a proposal for a directive be developed with the next elements a ban the the use the  from genetically research originating medical information what the essential important is the fight the practices which closure the a contract on the the the a before medical research the introduction the a obligation for the insurer to the guarantee the a  a better coordination the  for people the in the union work and the there move and finally the introduction the a 
the would must give on the encourage and support the the national or transnational basis agreed codes for insurance and on a annual forum that this issues deals
mr the president i like president rocard the i thank for the praise the he to expression has the for my opinion
the systems for supplementary insurance are apart the what the mr rocard already said under more the because the the need the better health was against this the also the with the progress in the medical concern and with the the by way higher costs itself the national systems the health not always meet are
has is that the national systems still more deficit support they properly now once to the public work more and to still less money the the national budgets
during the years and the beginning the the years is the region the the member the the national systems for health same reduced the are monitoring the the together with the increased question to better health still more be covered by supplementary optional and voluntary by public and private insurance sent  with or without profit
there do the however large differences for between the countries and there are not detailed and similar statistical data which the would can how what exactly the offered what the best working and how with what weaknesses this supplementary systems are failure etc therefore the in the opinion that i behalf the commission economic and monetary policy i up out the the need the a green
before general current rules be was for supplementary  must the commission a green up which all this data and information be brought and developed basis the the findings the this green can we than for all member current general rules regulation for better supplementary  which the needs also the needs the the less privileged population in sufficient extent be covered
in this rules must however the account be taken with the fact that the here to supplementary insurance is that healthy competition must the and the efficient and rapid method the the private sector and are economic viability not in risk should be the
i like to finally mr the president still emphasise that the rapporteur the the report the mr rocard in broad extent account has taken with the scientific comments and suggestions from my opinion
i like also the mr programmes pronk and karas the i thank for their important contribution the the drafting the this report
president i would the mr rocard and also the mr marinos the i want thank for their together report that here today the table is
the issue the the insurance the the european words already very long are but the judgements  and  which the european court the justice decided that in the abroad obtained concern by insurance must be compensation has however the a additional dimension the this discussion given
the report the the mr rocard that for us is bears there also to the that the debate on the further development the the social security in europe within the context the a increasing competition and the turnout the the common  further exacerbated the
the current modernisation the the social protection has if important objective that a affordable health also guaranteed the
with particularly the universality the the medical concern must in eight taken be because the discussion on the social security the not as very the by the quality if the by the costs the the medical concern
the court the justice has with are judgements  and  the member the the european union a clear message given
we are still more against crossborder concern and the the the market in increasing extent applied the the health
either and in what and when that is still unclear
research and experiments show the that the not storms will are with medical tourism
that the concern still more on the border will be consumed the however if a doubt over water
the is the very important that the citizens in this process central the
this matter means the a and another for us but the means also what for the national systems
we have to make with subsidiarity
national systems the health and even the monitoring the the insurance in the health are national regulated but that means not that we not all to make have with same problems
precisely therefore is the as important and that is fact majority the most result the this report that the commission the short term a green makes on the supplementary modernise
that is fact the question the we the the commission must to you you this in the and as yes how long is that than take
because the is very important
the figures the this area are despite all attempts to not with other similar and the is therefore very important that there a such green is
for the rest are there very many wish the the area the the health
a important part the the wish are national but that means not that we not with other must compare
to now to is this to the certain informed a certainly were the been
the judgement  and  has for a breakthrough taken
i think also that this report the rocard for a breakthrough the that point has taken but the is very important that the commission this encourage now accept and with a really green the table is
than to we then look the what way we the continue must to
mr the president ladies and gentlemen the is good here social and political responsible people from all groups the the floor to hear the prepared are to to a consensus to seek
i thank the rapporteur i thank  michel for you initiatives which the problem the the supplementary insurance now already and therefore still the time the dealt
i i few general comments
we have the still never as good had
that be you under other how from the fact that our life any ten year with three year rising while we certainly not healthier life
we be over because the medical knowledge to the five year does
medical care costs however also still more money
however has everyone without exception right the same medical care
that is important for a social europe and the must we us also reform the others
the united states are very often a example for the free the would a intransigent mistake are to also their health if example to take
as from the american system us example that the medically in relationship to the gross national product duplication as high are if in the european union and that there in the united states still always as such forty million citizens a lack or inadequate insurance have
that has nothing with a sensible social policy to make
for the european union is the there than also the the to the ordinary and the supplementary insurance in joint consultation further to develop without the quality the the health the to really and the social weakest from to the
the discussion on the insurance must not in a impasse out
as the conditions for the supplementary  not the european level are defined must we very careful with the existing systems deal
the risk that less healthy citizens and older people the private but under certain conditions can assure is in the light the the social development unacceptable
such  should we in the european union not make
in a first stage is the than also necessary and sense to as quickly possible a green with a research to the supplementary  in europe the to to
then must we minimum for supplementary  in europe up if we least a somewhat equal and social balanced health want achieve and develop and the a social union want speak
i think that we that however all want or not
mr the president i thank the mr rocard for are report although i the not agree am with are original intention to in all eu a supplementary based insurance to the to to with a common legislation
i i there however hundred cent behind that the commission a green right which they the situation the the area the modernise in card brings especially the crossborder activities to the the way the to to or additional initiatives necessary are
insurance is because a national matter and the systems are different but the true that the increase number elderly and the growing demands the the health the systems economic in the way to
the is a problem that many different solutions requires as a better organisation and a greater efficiency within the health so there for same money more quality is can be
new emergency methods can also for better and cheaper treatment ensure
i am there in the general favour the that the resources the treatment far possible follow so the treatment and not the system in the centre are
in this respect are  and supplementary  rightly a good choice
each country must however itself decide what the subsidised
the is wrong that the eu rules right on example the provide the  or demand that everyone assured must be which they favour does the the diversity the supplementary  as the now in many countries there and according  principles function
the is precisely that there for serious diseases as cancer and aids a compulsory and solidarity system must there that everyone a good treatment guarantees
supplementary  must precisely additional are example for those the prepared are for a additional service to pay or to costs to cover the more trivial and often common illnesses where the a rational  calculation can make
mr the president the debate that has place after the presentation the the report additional clear see that there end two different views are a of and this view is unfortunately enough distributed like aspects the the life desama and the supplementary modernise a become make the the operators and the rules the the internal market
according this view is the market for private supplementary  with profit preordained to in increasing extent the  the the authorities the to complement
the those the this vision do  on  without profit the in several member a essential role play if suppliers the supplementary insurance
the other view the to the is in the original proposal the the rapporteur and by a number colleagues the shared like legislation and codes promote the necessary are to under the insurance systems to the to to the based the the distribution the the  and the guarantee that everyone access has to unequal this legislation and codes are also necessary to the risk the discriminatory practices and the selection the risks and clients against to to
the report the michel rocard that us today was presented with the amendments the the commission late see how difficult the is to this contradictions to help
in the amendments the we behalf the green group submit to we for the next points in eligible to take
in the first place properly we not to those the the accept the a fall the the relative share the the public in the health
the demographic development the consequences the the ageing and the increasing question to care must the subject be the a public debate
the is the the inhabitants the the union to the the end the that social debate to decide on the extent the the resources the must be allocated to the fundamental right the social protection to guarantee
the fact that  in increasing extent be transferred the  to supplementary systems brings two important disadvantages with the that the obligations the the  be smaller while the  without profit the not part the the selection the risks weakened be
we to for to in the report the recognition the to take the everyone right the care in place the the danger recognition the a cooking the for everyone accessible is
we to also for to any risk the discrimination or  from to racial that according us would resulting from the footing the previous medical into for the closure the supplementary insurance as in paragraph b the the
mr the president a  ago was i a serious  the
i assembling this medical aid and was to hear that i three weeks had wait the research and then still agree minimum a month the the operation the in high extent need was
i said when but i can because hardly are
i i immediately aid need
can i not if  be dealt
which i if answer was everyone the our  is a just large 
then was there however the a lending the to apply
suddenly was i to hear that i if i a private insurance had or if i itself the full costs would can pay immediately investigated would can be and by same doctor would can be dealt the whose treatment i otherwise two months would must wait
i ashamed i there a little for the the to  but i i for the solution elected
i was immediately  and that is the reason that i here today can are
otherwise had i home the with my mislead was
i feel i there however not good the because time if there the  patients the same way if in my case priority granted the must other people longer with their panacea continue chinese
in the care must because use made be the same doctor same nurses same frame and same resources or the now to ordinary or to  patients is
that the in that how greater the  the more to less resources there for the general health on are
according i is the totally wrong that money rules who there top the  is
when we a extended system for supplementary insurance to for those the the can pay or employers have the the can pay to we what which in the report the about namely a difference between medical care for ordinary people and quality medical care for who the the can afford
my group is the opinion that the the against this by classes certain organisation must up
we want common systems the basis the solidarity the for everyone just good are
the is course a good matter that the trying the current systems to manage as rocard proposed but the is the essential important that the private systems not should grow the expense the the common systems
mr the president the balance the michel rocard sanctions the the right the medical and social protection is alarming alarming but unfortunately enough also those
during the years s have the insurances to suffering had under a strong reducing the the 
the result is that almost all in europe a own contribution is introduced the adverse is for patients and there a clear step is the the area the medical prevention
we must therefore to to a better 
i would the emphasis want to the the specific nature the the french  the french insurances are guarantee for a good and solidarity management the the medical care
because although still more europeans use make the supplementary insurance for the compensation the their ranging remains the sector the the insurances the best guarantee for equal access to care
i think with particularly the the ensure the the worst compensation be as  concern and  to there but a few to mention
to the existence the this sector to guarantee seems the i absolutely necessary the insurances a legal basis to give to supplementary insurance the to offer
we must according i also absolutely avoid that the commission this sector addresses of competition
how can the guarantee that discrimination the on the health disability or genes the banned or not happening in the practice if the sector the supplementary insurance only would be governed by the logic the the free competition
with the view the the drafting the  is the necessary to genetically research and the use the the results that to ban for the closure or during the duration the a contract for supplementary protection
the is to the health the already our citizens and the cohesion the our regions
the inequality between the regions the the area the the development is already dramatically enough
let we also not europe the two speeds create the the level the the health
there is therefore need the legislation that clearly themselves but the must account be taken with the specific characteristics the the  in any member
mr the president mrs the commissioner the growing free movement and the increasing costs in the  the the member force us the first to a greater own contribution or the the legal systems or through supplementary private  and the second to a better coordination the the private insurance in the european union
i like my congratulate express the the to the the rapporteur the mr michel rocard for are excellent diagnosis
we to however few question the are therapy
here concerned i a distinction between are practical demands and the priorities the he the to to a solution to to and the the important principles are based namely solidarity subsidiarity and minimum
the accept we the full as the mr pronk already said want we not that there immediately a directive the quite
the new proposal the the commission employment and social affairs is rightly first must there a green on the current situation be up and only then can there be certainly or a directive or a recommendation desirable is
what the heterogeneous nature the the systems the like i still this say there are member with a relatively high own risk example the the costs the needle treatment
in the countries are supplementary systems important than example in germany where the the population member is the a from that still always compulsory is to necessary  for everyone to guarantee
let we in europe quickly the years for the future heading a social adapted  conservation the the existing standard if need with a supplementary insurance
the must the people time to to sufficient precautions to take
that is the alternative for people the insurance and very the the legal systems
president i join i the the those the michel rocard congratulate have with this excellent initiative that with in the best traditions the the commission employment and social affairs the this parliament
the report is based the the by the council in expressed intention to to to to convergence the objectives and policy the the area the the social security and regard the with the topical objectives the in lisbon are expressed with the to social cohesion in relationship to economic progress
i think that the relationship between the two elements a whole good is
in my input in the commission i i this expressly a third element the added that i i still a strong argument is for european action the the area the the insurance namely the fears the obstacles for the free movement and not only the free movement the services where bartho pronk the on had has but also the free movement the people within the european union
that is now back to find in with particularly recital j and the paragraphs e and f and the this report
many sometimes harrowing problems and examples from the practice have i to the amendments the
i am welcome that the rapporteur and the commission the accepted have
the is not chance that i precisely from my dutch background with such problems the faced
we know in netherlands a special combination the private and public individual and collective parts the a  that the last time the quite what changes subject is been
still just apart the the question or that changes the good were is there in any case many to little account taken with the effects the the changes for crossborder for  dutch in the abroad and for example germans and belgians the in netherlands work
from the view the the european coordination is the current combination the a tax financed  for residents a compulsory insurance for workers to a the  and also a private insurance with collective or individual regulations a from disaster
the  disguise the the the  because the not  is and only for residents applies
the private part has to make with the directives for the  in the atmosphere the the competition
currently is there in netherlands a discussion way on structural changes in the system
in the socioeconomic council the on a opinion prepared
the see there to from that there now last agreement is between employers and workers on a  which market and competition between insurance joint be with agreements on a compulsory recognising and a broad package with  this comes which in any case a generally and a  must apply
this to  and exclusion to prevent and a optimum access for everyone to guarantee
fortunately have the parties in the  the achieved that the create the such hybrid  the private and public elements possible the contradictory legislation from brussels can with
the has the on already early let inform and the sensible conclusion drawn that the total system now in any case under the social  must the
that would the coordination in european the for those the on the border work and live there in any case a document  the make
i think that this with in the convergence the the rapporteur for view the
also think i that the increasing labour in europe need is and a additional argument is to the the point the the ranging with such green and with measures to to
mr the president gentlemen members the mr rocard asking the commission to a green the to to which the characteristics the a  for the legal  be defined
in the logic would all performance the not in this  are included by supplementary private  must be covered
that means that the legal modernise the to now to always the the solidarity supported to a or la à  the reduced
the citizens must still more money in supplementary private insurance invest to expensive treatment the far by the  were covered to can pay
who example chronically ill is and a low income has will the in the future still hardly can let deal
that is pure social dismantling and a rejection the the principle the equal health for any greatest
we point this even reform the the hand
in article the the charter the the fundamental is there the everyone right the preventive health and quality market health
the the basis would the commission a initiative must take and specific guidelines for the besides the the different member must formulate
than would the eu the can raise if the supporter the a social europe and market health for all citizens from the the fact or they now many or little deserve
the is sense  from to legislation for supplementary private  in the extent which the the the free movement the people and workers like guarantee
we support also the demand for a ban the genetic testing or medical into to  from to the
the supplementary  must  against he insolvency and just manipulation cover and should not must if lever to the  from to one
mr the president also i like the rapporteur like congratulate with are report that is the because a report
with particularly in paragraph confirms the rapporteur that with public resources financed  under the exclusive competence the the member must continue to the and this am i the fully that agree
he the the the urgent need the health the holidaymakers the the in a other member are the to tackle from the many letters the i this the fellow bag know i indeed that this problem live
all drawing he however under more in paragraph the attention the the considerable problems the the conservation the the public systems the health the all in the eu under pressure are if result the the increasing question the a ageing population and the increasing costs the say from the progress the the area the the medicine
this is very worrying
we have new ideas need under other for the formulae between the private and the public health
this report is a valuable contribution the this debate already hope i the that the rapporteur the with i agree is that the report probably still accession is become thanks the work in the commission which also this side the the parliament a important contribution has made
the report is now in any case many less  the nature and that is only but good
the health the in the different member the different ways financed and private  play the therefore also different roles
even the definition additional means in different languages not at same
the is therefore not probably that we to one  solution will to
i will my british mr programmes ask to vote before the amendments and which the proposed a green in to must without that the precise content that the down but i will they questions the the vote to abstained with the to amendment
mr the president i believe the that the mr rocard driven the by good intentions but he gives however the i the impression that he the the  the are state on a odds  the
one says he solidarity and this believe he if socialist also in but hand the he not the large responsibility the the to the state and the systems to defend the not only the victims are the objective developments but also the target are become the specific policies
he like however also not the the other on the the concert to below the he like a realpolitik to without fully to the american model on to 
i i must we very careful are
we are indeed on a odds  and must two time give before we decisions take on supplementary insurance and this the all member impose
if the supplementary insurance a general nature to will the workers only increase contribute pay if this supplementary insurance however a selective nature to be they discriminatory and that want we course prevent
therefore believe i that the most part the the report the request the the commission is to a study to out to the existing systems and also a study to out to the american model and the model the other countries than know we least how the best in the area is
mr the president people as i the the their whole life on social issues have into remind the the old  still the the because the social security to defining if the whole the intervention the cover the risks the in  can be expressed the specific are for a individual or a family and the the involved people or the parity not itself can to
our health is course a the the things where we all large gentlemen the attach they the often only when we already not good health more have or when this the threatened
systems have doubt to suffering had under the influence and the consequences the the economic and demographic developments the developments in the health etc
also the by the compulsory social and  is cover is strong changed one is that the result the economic recession unemployment social exclusion the before the new diseases and the ageing hand are also the scientific progress better object the development the new  techniques and  the influence been
the is a when and demonstrably fact that europeans not only by the social  or sustainable the the authorities the course a compulsory nature have against risks in the with disease pregnancy or age be protected the protection the elderly change moreover also because the population experiencing
the right the access to social facilities and social services the by the articles and the us  charter the the fundamental the the european union recognised and protected in the charter the also declared that a any the legally within the union they or the journey is accordance the community and the national laws and use right has the social facilities and social services
the supplementary private insurance voluntary or not there addition the compulsory public system and can a means are to within a certain time quality medical concern to received
i think that we the report the the mr rocard the we the congratulate therefore strong must support the rapporteur request the commission us the service to proof a green the to to which we can made how the insurance in the member currently are regulated so we can determine how the in the future further must
mr the president this report and the this annexed justification leave the a shocking observation
since twenty year is the legal modernise the the inhabitants the europe constantly repression and remains the share the the medically the they for their own account must take only but grow
a growing part the the population see are living disappear by bad paid jobs unemployment poverty and social exclusion and has not more on the resources to the properly to speaking or even access to have to the most basic care
this unacceptable situation like the report overcome by simply the use the supplementary insurance the insurances or  from to extend
according the report are supplementary insurance the solution for the problem
but for who certainly not for those the still more will must pay for their care while the society their the resources this right
the for the  the the the member the market the the health to presented
this report and some amendments want rules against  the on the  or disability impose the sharks if the insurance  the the contributions has tenfold the parents the mentally disabled
the impose the such rules seems us the the least what the can do and we will also for this rules vote but we are not the plan to our approval to attach the the intention the this proposal to the member to  the a task the literally the vital is the public health
while the medicine considerable progress has made continue fine statements on the access the everyone to unequal only commitment statement because the withdrawal the the states from the health and the increasing privatisation of can only into in a selection the basis the money a growing inequality with consequences
speaker the by the president cut
i thank the mr rocard for are initiative but mr the president if representative the the party the the pensioners can i course not silent
the the because almost if the perpetrated given the the current crisis in the health because the citizens and the pensioners as long life
i must say that the subject i at in are smuggled has mr the president because i see you for i if  with a constituency  a  and a certain which you the patients the the bowing time
we debate therefore on medical concern  and private concern
if the  however as good work why  the italians than    that with a deciding the the name the the from that you after a treatment the that from still just ill and with fully reason to to complain precaution
why has president  the famous italian obsolete  made with a film the 
why said the famous doctor   the i previous week to my large pleasure the a by the mr  organised congress i about the a question the i that the first  in a private  in south place
why see you in a important  in rome patients the their  in a chamber with others the about their afternoon and meeting degrees that is i unfortunately happened when i my really mother the god they thank still live in that hospital was who
we must therefore good give why the  a failure is become
i think because the public health money the before a treatment dealt the and the private health only then and if the treatment cure is
therefore together with my pensioner friends request i commissioner diamantopoulou itself the constituency  the to draw and the diseased health the the european union to cure so the us better is
mr the president mrs the commissioner mr the rapporteur i like first my mr programmes the gentlemen marinos pronk and menrad but also my mr  you thank because they i as have supported the the wording the my amendments and the adaptation the the objective the this was
the financing the the public health and the the the pension the in the centre the the social and budgetary discussion in europe
this are two reasons for one is there the demographic development hand is there the professional and technical progress in the medical world
the financing the the two systems can the three ways done through the the through the borderfree or private
we know all that the systems different built and by different networks linked are and that the supply the member to member from
the two systems are also subject the national provisions what the mobility and the flexibility the the workers in europe wish and the costs for the employers increase
i am than also welcome that the rapporteur are binding demand to a directive the to to has let see and now to a thorough analysis in the form the a green asking
i am welcome that we the the idea are other to the french model not the europe to to apply what for this issue not possible is
the is necessary that we the understanding supplementary insurance clear defining
for i means this the voluntary basis private or through the companies and if supplement the the public 
speaker the by the president cut
president firstly congratulate the the mr rocard for are report
the is just important if the the the has procedure on the supplementary insurance
to misunderstandings to prevent like i again stress that the present report the supplementary insurance the and not the health if such already is the course as that both not should  be
the supplementary insurance presupposes a legal system the claims and facilities
this the quite guaranteed system must a so adequate accessible and therefore also affordable health to offer
how better the legal system how smaller the need the and the important the supplementary insurance
however make the technological development and the demographic situation with baptism and ageing a supplementary insurance not unnecessary and in a number cases even essential
this the still in the hand work by the made in the systems the social security in a number member
time is this also a enhance opportunity to people and groups to point the the own responsibility the matter
because as we not everything should shift the the individual citizens should we also not everything expect the the authorities
the supplement the collective  with private or trusts does fully with the subsidiarity
the regard the the supplementary pensions has the european union already a document legislation developed they has this done through the make the a green and the is than a directive 
the has therefore information opinions research done the systems investigated in the different member etc and that is also the good way
the clearly themselves that the member the ultimate continue to for their system the social security
but if insurance and therefore also supplementary  be offered the a common market than be there also common rules make with the to competition insolvency discrimination transparency and such
mr the president the first version the the report the the mr rocard did proposals the the  in europe destroying had can make
the is the essential important for insurance that contributions are linked the foreseeable risk programmes
that applies for all  as  motor and 
if the original proposals were approved to as discrimination the on the a medical past to ban would the contributions attractive be for chronically disproportionately and unattractive for healthy those
consequently would mainly chronically disproportionately a insurance conclude and that would have led to a vicious circle the still higher contributions and still less and still  
the would the whole industry destroying have made and  more under pressure have the
the is a classic example the socialist interventionism
by to try discrimination the on the the  to eliminate would the mr rocard the egg with the our eggs have gender
this does i think the the story the the schaumeyer the to a businessman to ship and him early how can the the you the service are
when have we that now agree by
course must we a strong and vital market for the insurance in europe promote and must we also the being the services by the authorities support in any case for people with complex health the not private to assure are
the best way to this objectives to achieve is the private sector simply are work to let do
there is now a proposal for us to a green in to must
that is better than the original proposal but even this is still to far
what today still a green is is tomorrow a  and harmful law
this industry and the patients the that on are are the best help by they with upon to let
mr the president i thank the mr rocard and congratulate him with are report the mr marinos like i like congratulate with the opinion the are commission
the commission welcomes this initiative that the a crucial at is we have just because a political debate the european level on the modernisation the the social protection launched
we are for the first to the conclusion has that there need is the cooperation to the systems the social protection the european level to modernise
in this report be the economic and social challenges mentioned the resulting from the measures with the to the supplementary insurance the now the vital important is because the system the  the revision to is and because the need the health still greater the
in the report the the that the commission action must take and this are we the course that agree
the first must we account the with the large diversity the european level
there are enormous differences between the member between what the the definition the force the the systems and the combination the public and private sector
i will you a example give the illustration the the differences between voluntary and supplementary insurance the  varies the less than in sweden to more than in france
this figures are however misleading because both the concept if the cover the the system per country strong from
the commission will within its powers immediately action take and i will try a response to give the the conclusions the your report
what the first the issue the the green the are the problems such complex the nature that a green premature seems
the is however the important a length report on the situation the to to and this can the very short term
course the we account with the large diversity the national systems and the complex nature the the health in europe
the commission will immediately a research to the supplementary insurance up
because the complexity the the issue expect we not results before end
this research can if basis must for a communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament which initiatives or measures be proposed
accordance the ask the the parliament will we try a framework the to to and a objective and together analysis to make which account the taken with the large diversity and which the different aspects the this issues the mentioned to
you you the a large number aspects out
we think the especially the general issues as access the the health for everyone and  issues as the rights the people the the in a other member want draw or this want to work
on the other two proposals the directive the legal procedure and the european forum must we but agree good give
if the research on a year is completed would that the next step can are we have than not only the member between compared but can than also work with similar indicators the the important are with the view the any proposals for european cooperation
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
fight the social exclusion
the the item is the report a the mrs figueiredo behalf the commission employment and social affairs on the proposal for a decision the the european parliament and the council to the the a community action the encouraged the cooperation between member the fight the social exclusion com c cod
mr the president gentlemen colleagues mrs the commissioner the is us all know that the social inequality in the european union the over ten year is has million europeans approximately the the population live under the poverty
the situation from considerably the member to member but one thing is certainly portugal is there the most the to
but as the the portuguese population live in poverty
low wages insecure jobs plimsoll expenses and narrow pensions and benefits the prevent that both workers and their family if older people a dignified there can lead are of the main cause during the meeting the the european council in lisbon the and march was the the the need urgent measures to take to the this unacceptable situation the poverty and social exclusion a end to make
to must indepth changes to be made in the macroeconomic policies the community and national level there must with particularly doubt and put be the the the about the the monetary there the the pact so not only the current poverty the fight but also in the future new crisis can be prevent
in this context deserve the new technologies and certain social groups as women children and young special attention we must guarantee that all people access have to a properly levels and humanitarian lives and working
despite the obligations the the council recently still the the summit the lisbon is made despite the emphasis the this was the the the correlation between economic progress and social progress are the down proposals not more than a attempt to the face the the council to save they give the impression that the council everything in the work the to the poverty from to racial and therefore are repeatedly concerns promise its
in being is the by the commission tabled proposal for a community action the encouraged the cooperation between member the fight the social exclusion not more than a 
therefore is the the essential important that certain aspects the the programme be strengthened with particularly the development the innovative processes if part the the open method the coordination
the must special attention be spent the the most affected population and the social groups the the risk are of in the future the victims to be
the report contains still other important proposals
as the under more suggested the reference for the implementation the this programme the to draw the to million euro the commission the asked its policy to coordinate with particularly the the area the economic and monetary affairs taxes competition consumer fisheries and agriculture order the poverty and the social exclusion the national level from to racial
to must they its policies and programme programmes into the the possible consequences that for poverty and social exclusion
i hope that also the proposals the the important the qualifications and integration in the work emphasise the your support can count in this respect must account be taken with the the still more expanding phenomenon the social exclusion and poverty despite the exercise the paid when
the is the fundamental important that the council are promises fulfilling does not only in the with the programme but also with the to the definition the the purposes and direction the end this year must be the the council must the in the conclusions the the summit the lisbon created expectations not 
he must the fight against poverty unemployment and social exclusion with all possible resources support
to finally thank i the members the the commission employment and social affairs the rapporteurs the the other committees the economic and social committee and the committee the the regions the social ngos and the experts the the commission the french presidency and the parliament the with i have worked for the excellent understanding
in this codecision are we the managed a consensus to achieve the to objective has the final to simplify and the rapid approval the the text by the council to promote
the proposals the we tomorrow the vote will present are the result the the in the competent commission reached agreement with including the the new proposals to replace and rejecting the various other  amendments
my thank for the understanding that you for this process know the to to our contribution the there also for that the european union the this level again on a programme will can have despite the undeniable restrictions and deficiencies
the is fact in the first place to a instrument that us must help greater vigilance to commissions in our fight for more social justice
president i like in the first place my thank express the mrs figueiredo for its report
in the second place like i also the s express that there indeed a compromise is on this important report which the possible the made to the first reading successful the to conclude
with the to the amendments the the committee can i to my pleasure say that they all are adopted
fact is the to three points
the first point is that the committee was that in the programme in compared with other programmes to little parliament was and to many council that the however to many the the council was appropriate
the second point and that is fact the the point is the issue the the comitology
the is the some points the very to the member turning
only the up the a committee lead already to a half year postponement the the creation the the programme
the has a half year need to that committee in to to the everything to to and than need they not agree their usual  to to apply because than take the the a year
the comitology is really a enormous compromise also the this programme
i would the commission want questions to to the the what what the mr patten done has also still agree after to think or not something among the the member possible is
the finally the issue the the technical support
the committee the that that the technical support in the programme the included
what the commission social affairs end has the is million
the must a appropriate amount aside be for technical support such that the programme also really sufficient support the
therefore complaints on the the side the the commission are according the parliament about if the technical support in the programme itself the included
mr the president ladies and gentlemen also we the the economic and monetary commission want the rapporteur with its proposal congratulate
they has already described how scandalous the situation is the the european population live under the relative poverty
this is not only a issue for the commission employment and social affairs this is certainly also a issue for us if economic and monetary commission because the million people not only not resources to and not social and cultural rights have but also because the them impossible the made to with their own talents that to work the the construction the the society and because the their impossible the made their own talents to develop and the professions from to exercise which are suitable are
therefore have we in the economic and monetary commission united a ideal geared by to say that everyone in the must be the to by own work a essential contribution to the own living to make
everyone must in the be the to the to develop and the further to 
we aware but already to good that this problem not with a stability action a transportation focuses can be corrected
the is here to a permanent situation which any new  again winners and losers will
therefore must the society for open mechanisms ensure which the involved again 
we see three aspects social integration must the first if task be defined and therefore must the results the our efforts also in the  be included the second must we through open coordination the local and regional bodies mobilise so they their contribution can make and the third must the member as in lisbon was called and which when is started the last agree be on targets and benchmarks so the parliament this process can control and contribute
mr the president mr the commissioner my group is extremely met on the proposal for a community programme the fight the social exclusion this is according us a milestone in the attempt this phenomenon to learn know to into and to combat
this is a has phenomenon that the in all european societies happens and new forms start the to take the result the the proposal economic and technological situation also many governments are the in embarrassed the and behind has the not only the awareness but also the fight the the social problems the this radical changes bring to
we give support the the  the this programme as the multidisciplinary approach the  and the measures the the area the education and housing also vote we in with the following the this programme the other related policies which the a supplement must are and with the participation the not governmental organisations and the people itself the the victims are the social exclusion
we give support the the increase the the budget to million euro and the attempt the programme close the citizens to to
this is a good opportunity to the citizens to let feel that the social europe there that the social europe the certainly the born and not only a pious wish or a expression but a reality is
therefore attach we also large important the the cooperation with local regional and crossborder bodies we have with the view this different amendments tabled the fortunately in all groups in good earth are cases
the commission equal opportunities has that out that in the programme account must be taken with the fact that women particularly vulnerable are if the to social exclusion is and with particularly certain groups the women as immigrants disabled unemployed unskilled and single women with a family
this groups the women are not only outside the social tissue to to are but can little the conditions acquire the them readmission can guarantee
we will the implementation and the assessment the the programme good in the monitoring the mr the commissioner we are namely the opinion that this programme can contribute the the achieve the the objective that us all for view the namely the objective the the social europe the objective the the europe the the citizens
this debate the now cut and will to be continue
update the the stability the germany finland and netherlands
the the item are the recommendations the the commission on a opinion the the council on update the the sank programmes the germany finland and netherlands
mr the president the commission has today three recommendations adopted with the view the just many opinions the the council on the updated stability the germany netherlands and finland this are the first member the updated programmes for the round have presented
as you the will remind provides the stability and pact in strengthened monitoring and is the from the the  the the member during the third stage the the economic and monetary union
the stability the the member the the euro any year must present forms the central part the this monitoring
the countries outside the euro be convergence the strong the the stability seem although they other objectives have
in the stability are the strategies the medium term for the public finance included
the question is how the medium term a balanced difficult with a surplus can be achieved
you will the remind that we towards to to a certain reserve the to build so in case the a crisis the deficit the deficit with not more than the standard the the the gdp to over is in times the crisis can that course done
that means that we the periods which the economy a ascending line some must use to any deficits to to the to a balance or a surplus
the member take the the annual update the the programmes a year more in their programme the analyse the budgetary that they the last year have held explain and describe the measures the they the budgetary have taken and review their estimates and 
we update this programmes now for the second time we were that for the first in and we do that now in again for a period the a year more includes
the commission what the programmes the the member and the basis the the assessment can the council the by the commission made recommendations adopt
before this happening be the recommendations and the programmes itself however extended analysed by the economic and financial committee
in this framework and to the parliament the the informed to the take the commission the certainly necessary report from to to on the progress the this process
the commission can within the regular annual procedure for the assessment the the budget still a another type the recommendations do which the commission there in necessary case the can point that certain member not the the standards for the deficit meet the is to been still not need been this instrument that the coordination the the economic policy must to use
the budgets the the member meet to now to namely the the standards the the stability and pact still more member succeed the their budget in balance to to or even a clear indicated to achieve
that has us the the think the we have us wonder or the opportunities the the stability and pact not are towards now the quantitative objective the a the  is success
perhaps is the useful there other aspects in the to take the the the quality the the public in the next programmes the have the commission has ensure elected this way to follow and that means that we now also other aspects the our annual assessment to involve the we previously outside one did
in the first place will we the nature the the budgetary the any the the member assess in function the the economic situation which the member the is that like say that we assess or the measures  or  the nature are and in what they the market support or precisely tension the the market cause
in the second place try we also the coherence the any cuts and  to assess the the hand the a number principles the us in the to a common position this to determine
in the third place and that is very important assess we in what there there is the a restructuring the the public the the growth and the production the good is and the future tight does
finally assess we in what extent the annual national budgets the what ambitious strategies for the management the the public the medium term apply
problems in the with the ageing the the population be example still important
what this point the like i there now only just the point that the last ecofin the commission has asked to the longterm the the ageing the the public from next year the the assessment the the stability to involve
a the the three programmes the i now will discuss namely that the netherlands contains already a annex with a specific analysis the this specific problem
i will now very briefly like the the three recently updated stability the the commission today has dealt
in the first place have the three member in issue very large progress made with the sheet the their public since they in decided the the monetary union part to take finland had even in already a indicated and netherlands reached that in
the new programmes the this member are to and with finland the the the objective a indicated to maintain that more than the the gdp is
netherlands has low surpluses success the greater would can are if we the development the the economic growth in eligible take and if there certain economic decisions be taken the now still in decided are
for germany is the matter otherwise this country is gradually the way to a complete balance
in three the cases there there however sufficient manoeuvre to a any crisis the head to offer without the maximum deficit the to exceed
three the countries are intends in and the subsequent years considerable  by to to which the tax the the factor work will reducing and the employment and the investment be promoted this  are than also positive and necessary provided the stability the the public finance the maintained
in germany and netherlands provides the for next year a deterioration the the difficult the result the this 
that is with particularly for germany the important because the gradual reduction the the deficit this the cut
a the the aspects the the german programme where the commission the course ensure on makes and which we will insist is that this  the only one year manifests the result the the taxes but not consequences for the future has
what netherlands the makes the commission the ensure on other things as the adaptation the the policy mix and the risk that the authorities the however already strong economic growth by the  still further breaking which the dutch economy  would can are
our main message is therefore that the reduction the the revenue by must to with a strict control the the public
germany and netherlands have this year many money earned with the sale the licences for the third generation mobile thank
in germany total this income the the gdp in netherlands
both countries have this income very consistent and correctly used to the debt to reduce
by this factor but especially thanks a more  and a higher economic growth will the debt the next years clear a falling trend there
as the example expect that the german debt this year will reducing to the standard the the the gdp while netherlands this year still lower will it
in finland is the debt already far under the agreed level and remains steadily fall
by the reduction the the debt not there less interest to be paid what a the the macroeconomic is to the taxes to can reduce and in some cases certain public to increase
a the the positive aspects the the dutch programme is that the as i already said special attention the spent the the consequences the the ageing the the population the next years for the exchequers will have
this problem will the in several or lesser extent also in other member arise as the the last meetings the the euro and the ecofin clear is made
if we think that the costs in the future will increase will there the short term decisions must be taken to the costs to control and their  the long term to guarantee
the dutch government will the basis the its own programme important decisions on the use the its  must take the would good they if they the resources used to the reduction the the debt to up which they a greater reserve the would build to this type problems in the future the head to offer
the ambitious objectives the the finnish government the with the to its indicated the are now already largely by the mentioned ageing motivated
we hope also that germany the the next update the its stability more attention the this aspect will to especially with the view the the consequences the the reform the the pension the currently place
finally am the the commission that germany netherlands and finland their updated programmes as quickly have tabled
in netherlands and finland are the programmes right with the budget for next year adopted the commission take this a better approach than previously when we this  only were after the budget in any country was presented
this the guaranteed that the annual  within a strategic  be taken also to the institutions the the community as a topical and completely overview the the economic situation the any country that the the most recent figures based
the commission recommending the other member the still the their  work than also the this example to follow this year will that unfortunately not more succeed but the next years can that the
this are the most comments the i on the three today presented programmes wanted make
i i to your available to a and another further to to explain to your views to know and any questions to answer
mr the president mr the commissioner we are you grateful for this report on the development the the or in the european union
general given is the balance however positive
the the up the the treaty the maastricht was still based the a maximum deficit the
the average the this deficit for country is now approximately and we to the direction from the budgets in balance the is therefore the good on the
mr the commissioner you you not afraid that the deficit in the federal next year in place the to fall again with a half expand will increase despite the fact that the  this year if a warm rain on the german finance are 
we see that this the development is in the the country the the euro while in netherlands and finland already was achieved what we demands namely a indicated the  the the to high debt
i repeat my question you you not concerned
i like still a time with emphasis to that we the the european party addition a independent european central bank a consistently application the the stability and  if a essential pillar the the price in europe as
mr the president as i just already said is this a the the points where we in the case the germany the have out two elements are here the important
in the first place are that the  the as i already earlier i said are used to the debt to reduce so the debt practical the arrive
the income from the sale the the licences for the  mobile thank must to accounting reasons also for the reduction the the deficit be included
the is germany in the a indicated the half cent the the gross domestic product from
if we the income from the licences for mobile thank of from success however a deficit the and that is the figure that we for the sank use
to a answer to give the your question can i you say that the deficit on therefore is in will this are and as you rightly said will in the deficit again increase to in place the further to fall
why accepts the commission this increase the the deficit
especially because the positive consequences the the measures for germany can have
the tax in germany is 
the package measures that in germany is adopted has although greater consequences for the supplies the the economy than for the finish but however will the also a certainly effect the the question have we think that the barriers the the german economy the the medium term will increase
therefore find we the good measures also already the they in that there again a step back the the
we make us however the certainly ensure on this step back and that to we in the programme also not under torn or banks we are us that aware that any step backwards later must be outpaced
hence that we there the the german government the insist particularly the to apply the the up the the  for and that to to see that the income increase and the expenditure fall so the deficit again decrease
according the current programme would the deficit in to reducing in to and in would germany are budget in balance have
something later and the a something other way than we like had given but in any case with sufficient reserves to not in difficulties to are if the a economic crisis happens
mr the president i think the good that the public finance in the on countries positive besides but i i the that many people  be on the price in europe
they say that a the the the countries that for the economy in europe also a the the most countries is to know germany the risk the in a overstrained economic situation rightly to to
i like your believe on the  in germany like hear you you further the opinion that the general development the the inflation in the union a reason is to concerns
when i the on  had had that earlier the the the dutch and the finnish economy than the the german
in germany plays the problem the  not the same way if in the both other countries
there there the concern on the inflation that the the
we must not forget that we the last time with two negative developments are faced
the oil are in something more than a year  and if we this the development the the rate the the euro the relation the the dollar the add have the two developments together clear a negative impact the the inflation
as you know is the inflation currently what clear over the objective is the the central bank has the
the underlying inflation is however still but that like say that we the oil should as if the actual and fundamental cause the this situation
how the inflation the to expected will develop is a subject that i from november in more detail with you can discuss
the the day present we namely our economic perspectives for next year according our first estimates will we the year however conclude with a average inflation the something over the  the the european central bank is and clear over the figure that we in our forecasts the april had for
when had we the still on also in will the inflation higher are than we this spring in our estimates had for also such or
average will that however many closer the the it the as i already said the objective the the monetary policy the central bank is
this everything is course only the if the not new surprises with the to the oil and the direction the the dollar arise
mr the commissioner in your speech has you rightly the emphasis the the the problem the the ageing the the population in the three involved countries that however also applies for all other countries in europe and has you indicated that this problem resolved must be the expresses depends namely together with the  the if a threats unknown over the up the the public the the european countries depends and in the future doomed is to to take
in the bulletin the last july has the european central bank a possible strategy for the reform the the pension indicated that like say for the transition the the current schemes to a  also for the compulsory insurance the the way can resources spoke and can the term the sustainability the the european pension be guaranteed
mr the commissioner i would like know or the commission this still something on can say
mr the president i thank the mr della della for are intervention
the commission has the ageing the the european population already earlier the the item the and the european council the lisbon was the with the commission agree that this problem carefully had be examined
the committee for the economic policy has here the last months than also together with the commission the work
in the last ecofin is a report the the committee for the economic policy presented which in large lines that that the ageing in europe a general problem is although the not for all countries exactly same is
a country if ireland is example a clear exception because the a very young population has and the active population still growing while other countries with a higher participation a strong  population have
the report makes clear that the situation there by the to far out reforms the the systems the forward is
also the stressed that the reduction the the debt help the deficit low to the and the also the a solution for this situation contributes
the situation will the next twenty year per country differences but by the bank taken will the deficit by the ageing with or increase already to according the specific circumstances in each country
the two factors the i i mentioned will however not enough are to the problem the to solve
the member must course any for the decide how they this problem want solve the commission will topic not only proposal do
i i the impression that the formulas the currently in the different member be applied three elements contain
in the first place looking the to a method for the financing the the  which brows a certain role can play
i i earlier the dutch system that already clear  contains if example mentioned
in the second place try the member their public  with private  to unite addition the  can course without objection the up the specific funds be supported which the long term advantages can be success and which the problem the the ageing also can be take
end must any member however itself are choice determine because the member as i already said itself for this issue responsible are
thank you commissioner
bse and ban the meal in feedingstuffs
the the item are the communications the the council and the commission on bse and the overall ban the meal in feedingstuffs
mrs the president i am welcome in the opportunity to are you the the informed to to the the last developments on the bse
i was however already the plan the report the the commission  that the british government earlier this month has published under your attention to to but the events the the last week in france adopt i the matter earlier to the to to
only a dangerous secretary or maturity spirit will the opinion are that the bse behind the back is
we are there agree to more the reminded that bse not to the past one but rather a still still financing risk is
the last year is in france a worrying number cases the bse discovered partly the result the the introduction the specific tests
also has the in the trade to the beef from the a herd where a case the bse is been under the public the fear exacerbated that the controls the protection the the health inadequate are
the is clear that we extended the this developments must consider and there learn from must draw
to to start must we the facts agree good the a together to
currently to there in france the a million bovine bse for
this is considerably less than the international criterion for high namely cases per million
the relatively low figure is however not reason to satisfied to are
the is a fact that the number bse in different member increasing
as long there not clear and transparent proof is that the spread the bse in all member decrease is effort vigilance is
important still we must learn draw from the recent events
i like the most points record explain
the first the the has number cases the bse that in france is been largely in the with the fact that the french authorities are started testing to the
this is the result the a decision that such experiments from january compulsory the
all member would the french example must follow
the second can the need the strict controls the bse not enough be stressed
there is a very range the controls down
if this in eight be taken and be carried the the risk for the health to a minimum limited
i come here still the back
the third must the approach the the bse transparent to are
the reactions the the consumer be the defined if  irrational or 
the lack the clarity and transparency in the approach has in strong extent to this unfortunate situation contributed
the finally must we not forget that there the last years with particularly last year many progress is made the the to the to the a framework the fight the bse
the have we also a the made to to to to community systems which such disasters in the future can be prevent
i was honest said disappointed that prime jospin yesterday in are statement has failed to point the the very positive role the the eu the last years has played
inspired by this parliament is the commission the driving been behind the discussing the measures the fight the bse despite the often lack the support from the member
the work is however still not the
there be currently important proposals example on animal waste and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in the council and the parliament dealt
a still important initiative is the proposal for the up the a european authority that previous week by the commission is approved
we must prevent that the recent events the progress in risk to
i expect that the european council in nice the proposals the the commission for a european authority will support and i i the what you mrs the president the that point only still has said
the parliament can the are turn the proposal support by there the highest priority the to give so the as soon possible the approved
to back to to the the central issue would i want say that the events the the last weeks questions to a response
the position the the commission that specific tests need are to a reliable picture to to the the spread the bse in the eu is by the results the the tests in france fully justified has
this tests must however the many greater scale to be carried
the public like the guarantee that the existing controls effective are
comprehensive tests will now the most effective way to are to this guarantee to obtain
the commission like next week monday the the agriculture proposals present which fully meet the has the the wish the the public regarding this guarantee
the european parliament is a consistent and resolutions favour the this tests and i am the your support for the approach the the commission
also must be discussed what the events the the last days for consequences have for the measures on meat and meal
there must be sought to a statement for the has number cases the bse not only in france but also in other member
time again the with the here finger out in the direction the contaminated meat and meal
france has yesterday decided the use the meat and meal time to ban
i am hear to the position the  the french inspectorate for were the the french authorities must help the the decisionmaking regarding the question or this provisional measure must to be yet
there are still still signs the there strong the point that the has number cases the bse in few member are origin take in the period before the introduction the more controls in
and the is certainly as that the current controls very strict are
there is example a ban the the to the meat and meal the ruminant with particularly cattle
meat and meal must under high pressure be  and this process must the strict conditions to meet
specified removal must be from and destroyed
there be active measures carried including testing to to prevent that with bse affected components in the food and  into
this controls are however only effective if they the the right way be carried
research by the food and veterinary bureau the the commission the often the weak places in the implementation the this controls
in few member the to the the the results not really seriously action taken
this is downright unacceptable
the is unacceptable from the view the the health
also is the rather since the not out the the controls will lead to a complete ban the meat and meal with the financial and ecological consequences the this
from financial and  must therefore be favour for strict compliance the the agreements
the commission will the its turn the member continue point the the important of
the food and veterinary bureau the the commission its now already the highest priority the controls the the member the fight the bse
i request the food and veterinary bureau again a fundamental and carefully research in the member from to to
the regulation that specified removal must be from and destroyed is only from october the force and i like from the field urgent confirmed see that this regulation the observed
i would the the this level very appreciate if the parliament also a contribution would make by the member the the important the this controls to point
also is there currently a important proposal the approval the the parliament and the council on the regulation the animal waste
this proposal offers the possibility to to to to a extended framework which all relevant issues on animal waste be tackled
i hope again that the parliament remind will help this proposal with urgency the the agenda to to
a number speakers has the issue the a complete ban the meat and meal the the item the
i like still a few supplementary comments places the what i earlier on this issue i said
in a situation if this is the always respects to seek to a fallacy a solution which in one blow the risk is penalised and the confidence restore
you you i earlier hear say that i to the consumer to full transparency like commissions
that means according i also that i the consumer not must examples that there a fallacy there which this very delicate issue can be resolved
a example the as such fallacy is a complete ban the meat and meal
my only concern with the to meat and meal is or the the or not safe is to in feedingstuffs to be processed
the defend the the economic and ecological benefits the the use that late i the others on
what the safety the repeat i that there already a has range the controls there to to prevent that bse through meat and meal the transferred
as i already earlier i said would the perhaps banned must are meat and meal the ruminant to to
the scientific opinion is that under the down conditions produced meat and meal not risk will
this parliament is the agree agree that the safe way produced meat and meal must can be used
that has the parliament in the promised the declared i quote recycling the pathogen and byproducts the the slaughter by the production the meat and meal is from economic ecological and nutritional the best alternative
but as i already earlier said the in eight take and out the the down controls is maintained for the safe use the meat and meal
if the controls weak places contain are we clear with a problem
i i that that all member the this point their responsibility take
the food and veterinary bureau the the commission will are efforts double to ensure to ensure that the member their obligations fulfil
i like this still the add that i the decision the france to meat and meal to ban if that is motivated by doubt on the reliability the their controls fully endorse
in this the am i welcome that prime jospin yesterday also a considerable enlargement the the controls the the chain has announced including a long pursued
monday will i the member questions in what they fear that weak places the contrary are with the community legislation the regard the the implementation the controls the last years have contributed to the has spread the bse
the finally mrs the president like i here still the add that the commission the basis the a codecision recently a proposal the the parliament has tabled for a regulation on animal waste
the the a community framework proposed which all relevant issues the regard the the processing the animal waste with particularly in feedingstuffs the the item to
remarkably is that in the discussion the already with the member on this proposal is held a ban the meat and meal in feedingstuffs and than mean i a complete ban not if a necessary measure to the is
in place of there the view that the eu that must to to see that only animal material suitable for human consumption in meat and meal the processed
the is to see or here by the current situation change in is
late i you there in this the the remind mrs the president that i still but five months ago the approval the the council i know to obtain for a ban the the use the specified removal in the food and 
yes the sounds credibility but the has four year took to agreement to achieve on a measure the i i the fundamental important is for the protection the the health
the obstacles the the obtain the support for a ban the meat and meal must also in this light be see
i assure you however that if i a ban the meat and meal in feedingstuffs necessary eight to the health to protect i as such proposal irrespective the obstacles will submit
the parliament has now the opportunity clear giving to give the a future policy the community level on animal waste
all options the in the proposal on animal waste be mentioned are us the available also a complete ban if this necessary the considered
i see from to your report and the proposed amendments and i assure you all cooperation to will to the proposals to improvement
mrs the president indeed would this debate today unnecessary are been if all member the demand the the committee bse and the followup of the february and november immediately fully had into
i like also recognise that the commission certainly also if result the the strong pressure from the european parliament in the last years significant what pressure has exercised to the producer preventive better to protect
but the member to everything still always to late to
quickly act and however seriously continue both must however possible are
the citizens understand not that our legislation in times the crisis as long the the late wait
also therefore say i that the commission the competence must to to in such times the crisis and in case the offences the the community or when there risk danger more to can decide and to act if the common welfare and the health therefore questions
i like also say that for embargo programmes within the internal market relevant  must there
the approved measures the identification the animals and labelling the meat forms a important basis for more safety and confidence
the is always better to the evil to combat where the the happens in place the vying the to act
let we together from this soilplantanimal the speculation and mutual accusations steps which bse fact the for   
therefore support i expressly the common resolution to from this atmosphere the configured a introduction the  for the whole area to demands not only the dead animals not only the animals over than months but if the can the all animals
applause
the the basis to we thoroughly  criteria to the risk gravely the absence the bse in the member to evaluate and can we new further decisions take
mr the president i moon the council expressly the to last its opinion on the  express to make
applause
we have the first reading in may concluded
the is a scandal that if there a causeandeffect the between bse and scrapie there there still always not common provisions for the fight that are
indeed france has the right to meal to internal political reasons to ban
but what for france in this situation perhaps rightly is applies therefore still not for all member
the is good that we us also for this point the the common decisions the the as the mr byrne already has explained
a partially effectively  was to liberticidal help because the safety not were respected
i say very openly that what we tomorrow will demands a general and time ban the the production and the use the meal to result that the standard respected the and all products purely are and the proposal for the final disposal the dead animals hard will arrive for many member but we do this that because there otherwise the term problems to
parts the animals the for the human consumption permitted are must however also in the future can be processed
we must also in the budget precautions take
a bse for all animals the by the eu that the financed means additional costs the million euro
there must also money aside be the to possible  to can take
in the sense will we also consultation to with the commission and the council so the commission the necessary corrections and precautions in the budget for the year can make
applause
mrs the president i would really not more know how often we in the last four year on this subject have discussed
i respect your courage mr the president the the council i respect the fact that you today here to to you has because the the rhetorical  the you the mr böge you been will the the not continue  the you and that say i emphatically for your other mr programmes in the ministers the
we have a legislation up the beginning of was the revelation the the scandal that the council years has want measures
the legislation the we have up is abundantly
the is example there the a ban the the to the meal the ruminant the production for meal and the the remove the removal
where was the council when they the legislation had into
how  has the commission not the the ministers behind before the remove the removal in a law was included
why has this council the the consumer must protect and the now does if the health the the human the most is not used said we meet this also without legislation
you mr the president the the council and your mr programmes had already long before the commission unfortunately enough what late proposed to only still the parts the animals the for human consumption suitable are to meal to processing same for the different member can decide
that initiative had you can take
i question i really the why we the dispute with the ministers on the labelling the beef for the european court have must extensive
was that really need
i question you also mr the president the the council why france you referred because to the french political as long has waited to the production for meal to to to
that understand i not
i understand not why france the provisions on pressure temperature and  the meal not more could into
the mr böge has the already said he and i were rapporteur for the  and we had the may a first reading of
where remains the common position the the council if this however as important is
mr the president the the council the you i this what  suspicion to you you if person the the committed with the human health and the safety the the consumer but i me still again the impression that the council many more account the with the  and the economic aspects
as there than as you the as contravention under the public the afraid the immediately that the beef will collapse and than is there response
i say you with any reservations mr the president that i i about when the countries the today to a fully feed the meal decisions the door again will open and will say that meal again the a safe way the produced and held must be
than will i however very obtain  and see or you this still something news to say you
i say you very clear mr programmes that we two affairs need have
the first have we good legislation need
for a large part have we the already up and this to we that by because the must quickly to you can this ensure
to now to was the council always the the brakes are and the was a heavy brakes
they are there with are consider the to are very efficient that give i you the a economies
if the good legislation there than is must they controlled be
therefore am i also as grateful that in our common resolution the tomorrow hope almost unanimously will be approved the called that the member report produce the their controls
i like know when germany france sweden austria or what another country than also benefit controls the the production the feedingstuffs has carried when there veterinary controls are done or the poor  the still competitive and or we perhaps additional  in service must take
if you that all serious believes you you not  if excuse need the can perhaps the a legislation on the safety the food prepare but can not offer what we offer good legislation and control
that is your task mr the president the the council
i would welcome are mrs the president if this my last contribution to this discussion in this house would are we will however ever a point must can to behind this subject
mrs the president the ban the france the meal in food is many to late
the this at is the only way to the vicious circle the little to break the use the meal if feed whole to ban
as long the not can guarantee that meal without pathogenic not the mixed with  must all meal be banned if feed
wisdom later is sense but i must in this debate however what the the beginning the the years when i if responsible for the  the swedish side forced was a exception to derogation because we in sweden a ban the the use the  had
we could there time a such exception but hardly through to but the failed also already was there a little to us  and said the that the however nondangerous was
now is the smile everyone the shipwreck
the was actually as mr the president the the council
you mentioned because the fact that the problem was caused by wrong production and that the therefore in france meal has banned
therefore had we in sweden the already long banned
the was because has that incorrect production wrong are and the from the the must be fight
i like still a few affairs stress the resolution the to i hope tomorrow will be adopted contains only very important points
the first point is that the origin the any raw in all types food in the chain consecutively must can be
in a situation if the the now in france and also this in many other countries has occurred is the the important the consumers to can tell where their products from to and how this products degrees can be
this demand is extremely important not in the last place if the to the terribly is
in the second place is the important and that is nothing news to stress that who the knowingly and knowingly a ill animal or a probably ill animal in the food or  late up a criminal act practised
of must any  the aware be
the is course clear that there the this at many people be affected not in the last place many farmers
in some cases is the need whole herds to slaughter what a heavy work means
the must than also not forget that the national systems for eradication the this terrible infection measures must include which the the farmers the good way financial compensation can to
what that the like i that point that we the the liberal group a amendment have tabled that to i hope will be adopted
the conclude like i like my thank express the commissioner byrne the to my opinion in this respect excellent work does
mrs the president mr the minister mr the commissioner best mr programmes given the concerns the currently under the european consumers and farmers there regarding the food must the council and the european parliament the respond
the bse late the currently regard if a problem for the health to not to say a social problem
the is unacceptable that the commission and the council one extremely integrity respond and the mouths are have the precautions and the hand to to vague decisions and endlessly meet
there are the community level although many measures taken but this be bad applied or support deficit
we must therefore move the specific proposals and ensure ensure that we on the resources have to this proposals from to to
if first measure demand our group that there in all member immediately systematic tests be set for the detection the bse in first body for bovine the over are than eighteen months and that same the use the meal in feedingstuffs temporary complete the abolished
those the today the day say mr böge that there the their territory not cases the mad prevent have there simply not to sought
the intensive farming is all the same way sport
therefore must we per country on a precise up have
our group demand a immediately ban the meat and meal for all  as the member not can guarantee that there rules be set to bse to prevent and the european directives the strict way be applied
mr the commissioner mr the minister there must resources to for a strict control this must ensure ensure that removal absolutely from the whole chain for animals the unsafe
also must the proposal the the commission be applied this the in that animal material that not suitable is for human consumption not in animal must be processed
meat and meal will for a large part also already is this time a new type waste forms
this can in kilns incinerated be or used be for the production the account
there there certainly a solution to  speaking for the  to find since the meal and that forget we still to often only a small part the their food part
 constituency  and  crops the the this at underrepresented are in the cap can a satisfactory solution offer for a safe food for human and animal
we can the enhancement save by the economic  to reform this system the there also today still for that farmers and consumers under pressure be the by multinationals the the earlier pressure make to their enormous profits than to the food
the political must the change to so the were guilty the this crisis punished be and there the on the the taken decisions a first step can be the to this dramatic crisis to end
that is the importance the the joint resolution
the is a heavy responsibility but we are elected to this fully the us to take
mrs the president the bse the in outbreak has i i clear demonstrated how empire to can lead that the health the the consumers and the interests the the farmers be down
also thanks the efforts the the committee the us parliament were there measures introduced to the health the the consumers to protect as was with particularly meal for ruminant banned and was labelling the beef compulsory the
of fraud and negligence and the lack also the adequate measures have we the bse still always not under control there are because again new cases discovered
we need not in panic to are but we should best admit that the concerns the the consumers completely justified is
my group is the opinion that the health the the consumer a condition is the priority must to over what other recital than also
therefore must we urgent measures take to the consumer reassure to to and are confidence in the food to restore
i know not or this the panacea is mr the commissioner but the seems i that we from when the on the the experience with immediate commit the use the meal in the speaking the all  including also pigs chicken and fish must ban
also must the tests to bse the to encourage be extended to all bovine the in the human chain into
the current crisis has led to serious  and a fall the the uturn which the farmers and the whole beef damage affected
we must both the confidence the the consumer restore if the affected farmers help
the is absolutely necessary that there specific assistance the is example in the form the reconsider or the allocation the a 
must we us however from the the actions the short term also not agree discussions the the method the the common agricultural
is the not the cause the the problems
also by this advantages creating a  production the the expense was the the environment and the quality the the products
therefore would we this methods must review
in being would the as bad still not are if the animals again  the more traditional food
i would want say give they what more grass
the european union must however also the cultivation the fertiliser  crops encourage so animal meal replace can be by vegetable meal
than must however also the gatt from be review since this rules that the european union not more than the its needs in the form the  crops must grow if under the the american exports
mrs the president mr the president the the council the bse is hypocritical in a collective 
the whole beef the threatened by the justified mistrust the the consumer while our farmers and other workers from the sector fear that the crisis them will ruin
that the as far has is is by the incompetence the the governments this was still strengthened by us own inability the head to offer the the double challenge which we us the saw namely a challenge from the view the health both the cut
i will here not detailed list give the the acts the by this or particular are committed
the debate that here the the was and which investigated the what party the council the commission or the parliament the most or the least has done seems i somewhat unnecessary
the reality is very otherwise
the facts are there and the are 
we were the the informed we spaniards the dangers the animal meal and the regarded removal
the scientific authorities had clear indicated that the development the the disease under bovine not under control was and had with emphasis out the the worrying increase the the number diseased animals
i think that the commission certainly failed is the introduced beef the only half month ago the force was the not as many for
the origin the the bovine can this not be overtaken also were we rather late with the ban the regarded removal
the approach the the crisis witness clear the inability also was there tragic enough not motion the the consequences that while the however to for were
where continue the programme programmes to the  within the union to reduce where just still the was mentioned
how the the with the incineration the animal meal and waste and with the introduction the compulsory tests within the union
the problem does the namely the the level the the whole union for and not within a only country
the is indeed as that the quality the the food is sacrificed the a the  at system the standardisation the the  and the products where not tasteless or taste more the is
the consumer latest already the the quality and now makes he the also still ensure to are own health
our citizens know that the crisis serious is because you can the people not impunity 
they know that the discovery in france the diseased animals to due is the the fact that we to seek as just already was said
there must extensive measures to both the national if european level if we a economic he and a enormous threat the the health want prevent
the proposals the the presidentinoffice president the the union must be adopted with particularly the ban the meal in feed for all sectors where animals be raised
there are however still two other comprehensive plans need and my request is to this without postponement from to to if we namely continue hesitate and postpone be the risk programmes for the health and economy only but greater
i think the measures the the french government in this respect affected has inadequate
the first and others have this for i already said must all are bovine the in the european chain into systematically be tested
over a year ago have the european authorities three tests for the also the bse suitable were including the french test the as the if the most reliable and sensitive test
this test can immediately the industrial scale developed be
this is what we without only hesitation and without any postponement must do and the the massive scale
just was about on  tests
testing will the confidence the the consumer and the producer however not can restore
the public opinion must fully informed be on the its the the test which i the i
the french test for the also the bse is developed by the  a ispra the the authorities
the test is in june evaluated by the european commission by dg  for consumer and was in july transferred the a industrial partner
point the the development the the test was the protection the the consumer and the application the very broad scale in the slaughterhouse this would prevent be that animals the a risk content for the human in the chain into
the results the the european assessment the in july were published showing the that this test to time more was than the three other tests the parallel were assessed
in september is a new research by the european commission evaluated and this confirms the previous results the regard the the sensitivity
the sensitivity the this test guarantees therefore that affected animals not in the chain can into
this test is within five at a result the and is without more within us scope this a production the hundreds millions juveniles per year not problems will
to this test immediately the very large scale to to can apply in regional veterinary laboratories not the only but to ensure for suitable staff in pending the informatics
the test there he is reliable and can the large scale produced be
this is what we must do and i hope that i you of convinced i
the second is there a reform the the community agriculture need so the our  grounds again soya  and  grown can be this is us the replacement protein which now a deficit is and the a very what better food for our animals forms than the american gmos programmes
we have our soya  and  sacrificed during the wto in longer
well characterise for bad agreements is that they again the discussion must be the more to more when the health this necessary makes
by demonstrated to give the courage and ambition can we the important the the health the the europeans unite with the economic important the our producers and this the confidence restore
this is however only possible if there not there more is the doubt under the public opinion that like say if the detection systematically i say with emphasis systematically the carried
without a general compulsory set test will the confidence the not restore you can confidence namely not enforceable you must the deserve
to this reasons has the group which i president am the resolution signed the tomorrow in your parliament will before i hope that this with unanimity the vote the adopted or in any case with a broad majority so everyone the aware that this parliament the in this case closely involved feels the the problems the our european citizens
applause the the group
mrs the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner i concerned the this opportunity use to the scandalous deportation the our mr jeanmarie le pen from this parliament still agree the the denounce to to the mr le pen had us remind can remind that the group the european right the first and the far the first was the already in september the attention the the parliament an the the fact that the bse   the perhaps not would to to animals and the agree would can might the the human
how was this when the responded
from this banks was nothing than  and criticism on the whole political acrosstheboard and the media  the in a  silence
in the time mr the president the the council has you nothing or almost nothing taken as your predecessors nothing have done against the consequences the chernobyl the aids and the affair the the with hiv affected blood the argument was the still that there not panic sown if be under the public opinion
the his commissioner macsharry this cluster negligence the pretext was that the beef not threatened if be and there not panic under the consumers if the
now have we to make with a disaster the the height is the economic and tackle and there there panic under all consumers
now the public responding as to expect was clearly you rush a ban from the the use the meal for all animals from name the the notorious precautionary
despite the way the experts and scientists the demonstrated had that this meal responsible was for the development and transfer the the  the bse forget you in your analysis to mention that this situation in the first place to due is the the anglosaxon  they have the meal namely from imperatives the a lower temperature prepared
you forget there also the to point mr the president the the council that france also after this in banned was machine with the import the potential contaminated meat and meal from the united kingdom
this imports were with particularly through belgium
the result reflect the inability the the political in are there in france almost hundred bse discovered and to the date are there in the united kingdom s people died the the atypical alternative the the disease the primates and in france two
why mr the minister mr the commissioner had we to october wait before there within the european union a ban the regarded removal was while this as such large risk will
why would we to january wait with the general application the tests the a rapid detection possible make which the mr pasqua just spoke
and than i i the still not agree on the  and  that only in completely will are despite the risk programmes for the consumers and the fully lack the guarantees for the farmers
now there panic there is you with regret to action on
in the light the this crisis is the however necessary that there guarantee to both for the protection the the consumer the the area the food and health if for the income the farmers imposes  and  they are all the victims the the inadvertently the the authorities both the national if community level and i say this with emphasis they are the not few way responsible for this crisis
therefore must the european union the the them solidarity up
the must real guilty the this crisis the the denounce to the british and american  must be persecuted if criminal if they the the informed were the the dangers the they 
we must the special responsibility the the commission under view see as the committee the us parliament has demonstrated
also must the real causes the this situation be the this are there four the system that without production necessary the violation the the animal by the feeding  to want make the down the the responsibility by the transfer the sovereignty the the national states to the brussels  and the finally your without 
this factors have the crisis in reality caused this terrible problem that also by your going is the can only the a sustainable way be resolved if you this causes addresses
mrs the president behalf all farmers am i my concern from on the ban the the french government the meat and meal in feedingstuffs
the is although a french action but the a with farreaching international consequences
 is the most  for meat and meal
the french ban will to a enormous question to  lead but the supply is limited
if result of will the prices under an high pressure to to are
the prices the feedingstuffs in europe would the agree to can increase
since the the operational for account the feedingstuffs is will producers the financial been to iran to
this would thousands small sourced the agree the destroying to can do
also will the related under large pressure to to are
 could for gbp per tonnes the the processing industry be sold
 costs gbp per tonnes
for a mediumsized slaughter where pigs per week be gender means this thousand gbp additional costs which only a small part can be compensated
more subsidy for the agricultural is not the solution
what we need have is  per iucn at the specific  so meat and meal in the pigs and  simply can be applied without risk for the 
if we this for other can to have we not ban or additional subsidies need
mrs the president mr the president the the council mr the commissioner the merit the this debate is in any case that the subject how the points major not only between but also between the council and the commission
also i am not prepared to accept that some member as arrogance are that they not legislation want since they itself not tests out
this is unacceptable
that france the currently in this situation is is because there controls are set which the elsewhere not has
this crisis limited the currently therefore not more only to the beef we have to make with a essential problem for the health and also with a economic crisis
the health the the european consumer must absolutely the the first place to the what decisionmaking than also
this problem affects the whole chain
the consumers are the confidence say and if we the damage in this respect want to must we the bse enlargement to all bovine and sheep
the farmers insist here itself the the
we must now emergency take measures the testify the healthy sense by the use the meal for all but than also all species to ban the the way the the principle only really in the practice the
mr the commissioner i i always many confidence in you had but i understand your reluctance not
how think you the principle to can apply if you a ban the meal reject
mr byrne you know that this meal always a certainly risk means
only if we this type measures take will the consumers reassured be and will the farmers the the the through the their unions for this idea have expressed understand that we us solidarity with them want up
the this at is the still not scientific the that the disease the other species the transferred
what we the certainly know is that we one the confidence the the consumer must restore and hand the agricultural sector must support
you must i not tell that we this meal not can destroy
we have many time lost since we already years ago for the necessary plants had must ensure to this meal to can incineration
you must i than also not to tell that we not in the are this meal to replace
mr the commissioner i regret the that your  not present is and that he not the courage has the confrontation with us the to to and from to to that a total reform the the common agricultural indeed necessary is
i migrating against the restrictions and worrying consequences the this policy with the of
the is not only necessary but also inevitably to the cap to reform the is namely not acceptable that a only country drastic measures the and the are economy in risk brings
also the other areas where us policy a lack the cohesion some must there there to are the european solidarity this the  grounds the use the meal for ruminant nitrates and phosphorus
the cap must be review to the farmers to support
there must the a better way be produced and the budget the the common agricultural must be used to this policy a new direction to give
mrs the president still not four weeks ago approved the commission a regulation good with  for animal byproducts the for human consumption for are
the must in the future not only  but also chemical contamination the imaginable be prevent
this proposal is to my opinion already very far and the account with the principle
within a sustainable  must the also possible are to animal material that is investigated and for the human consumption is released for the production the feedingstuffs to use
let we realistic continue
a general ban the the use the meal for all animals therefore also for pigs chicken and fish that a number member and also few mr programmes demands lacks any scientific basis
if we the logic the the mr programmes continue must we the sale the meat the wanted  also ban
as the proposal the the commission already the is the many important ensure to ensure that meal the the highest safety meets
companies in the member the the this at the the production the meal not the highest technological standards apply lose their  to they can proof that they the the the standards meet
regular and strict controls the the technological standards and the respect the the legal provisions for the production the meal must part of the a enough 
mrs the president we have already the a and another seen in this bse
a commission is cases a government in britain was to the reason not orderly and in france there a political crisis which no know how the will end
there are people countries the this bse if instrument use
a president the a country because casually that there not meal more must be used meal that never had should be used because france not the the standard meets
a minister the health the a german at says casually that they again a ban the english and french beef demand
same minister has refused to tests in to to what we in the with the lifting the this embargo have called
if they that not had done had we now in germany tests had and therefore also scientific can proof or there already than not cases the bse are been
than had the now not are about need to do on the fact that the in a category the included which the not included like be the has because simply the that the own region  was
and than must i here in this parliament also still the mr gollnisch hear say that are group the at in the discussion on bse is been
your group i i never given in the committee bse
you you this at not the part
than is a president the the council here casually tell what measures he now all must take
course true the what you says
the is course what you us here has informed course
the is european law
the is urgent necessary that we the commission instruments in hands give that is also a demand for nice
this commission must as also the mr böge already said the favour risk can the action and penalties so there not years cannot before what scientific and political if necessary the recognised also the into
that is the real scandal and that depends the this at not the the the commission that must be said mr byrne
i am than also welcome with your contribution the today
used has the however the agree the the commission 
now are the the member the the directives not want into
here must adequate pressure be exercised
we are the european level
therefore am i as free been to on france and germany to talk we as this because if a european problem and we should us not interfere in the national lengths the here be settled
we must all european citizens a conclusive policy can guarantee and that have we in this house people and sensible tackled
in the sense am i also welcome with the decision
we have us not let ourselves to a total ban the meal because than had we also a total ban the meat must demands to that something must eat be but not more the the animals must be held is not only nonsense the is political populism
this must we for apply we must simply robustly as we to now to have done
applause
mrs the president i like the commission questions not as  to are in its positions and its forecasts for the future
in december i i a question the on the  that was three months before the scandal outbreak
the commission said i when there is not disgraceful the the air and you not the not concern to make
i believe therefore that something more modesty not evil can
i i now again a question the the commission you you the costs measured the the current policy with the cheap morning and you you the costs measured the abolition of and support the the vegetable production
i am there namely not at the convinced that morning plus all  and dangers end so cheaper is
the third were all mr programmes on controls
when has the commission controlled
what countries you you for the court taken of not compliance the the legislation
i think example mrs the president the the labelling the beef which i rapporteur was the the parliament
the all countries the this
i see in athens still not 
has the commission someone for the european court the justice taken
the would interesting are that to know to to because than can we this debate continue
for the rest am i the fully agree with what the mr programmes said and this say i not for the form with mrs ainardi mrs auroi and mrs grossetête
mrs the president the guarantee the food must a the the most objectives the the european parliament the commission and the council continue this must effective rules be applied and strict controls be carried so the consumers again confidence to in the food
that everything must the a transparent correct way be done so the citizens the not deceived feel or sacrificed be the the altar the the large economic interests
we must prevent that the with bse affected animals in the chain into
we must therefore in all member the the european union a effective system introduce
meal must certainly not more be used until clearly the proven that the spread the diseases the not the promoted
by the disquiet under the public danger a whole sector in to landfill and who the there the least debt the have the farmers suffering the the damage the farmers are the victims and not the guilty the what there happening
farmers to their animals with the products the the industry them is as a few months ago in belgium with the chickens is happened
to the costs the the crisis not only the the shoulders the the farmers to let characteristics questions we to financial interventions the favour the them
the is also desirable that all  be isolated and the exports the meat banned the until result that the safe is
mrs the president i would in want to the the financial on the the matter also also if rapporteur for the budget
there is enough said on the procedure on the content the the whole problem with the bse
tomorrow start a trialogue on the budget
yesterday are the coordinators the the different parties in the committee agreement has with the proposal to the the area the billion euro the there still is in the budget million euro to strategy for the fight the bse
i i understand that to all are bovine over the two year in the european union to can testing there a amount the over million euro need is
 council and commission you you a broad financial basis to a strong policy to to
late the not as are that in the negotiations between the parliament the council and the commission on this million again discussion the
the area is in the budget the parliament has ensure elected and the is the you the court is the the  to the financial court for a strong  also really in the objective to support
my second comment the the procedures
remarkably is that the the official agenda the the council the hat for next monday and tuesday bse still still not officially is included the is the the agenda but the the still still not officially the the agenda
i question i the how can that if previous week the wednesday november the european farmers in  in  meet are has and strong measures proposed
how can consumer a strong noise let hear
the can however not as are that the in this public debate apparently to new that we still in a  the two centuries ago are for the implementation the the policy by council and commission
i call you the to a strong and in any case another policy to let see
on the transposition the legislation are a number affairs said
however like i that point that not human without food can not few day
the can however not as are that we also in political respect the priority not support
if that already a problem are the regard the to little protein and other products than can i you assure that the european milking sufficient potential has to that the to catch also with the to the feed
mrs the president as many others thank i commissioner byrne for are vigilance we are the the him used
if yes welcome i the measures the the french have taken
we are the there now on agree that bse that if a british disease is started and now if a french crisis the proposed in fact a european disease a european problem is and we will the problem if such must approach
accusations between the member or different generations the governments have not usefulness
there must a solution to
the minister mentioned meat and meal a cheap 
if that however lead to spread the bse and the human alternative that is the not more as cheap
that is the problem where the today to is
various speakers have there already the out that we the ban the meat and meal in feed for exists must enlargement
in the united kingdom is the use the meat and meal in all feed already banned
our own  will the soon express on  recycling i hope that this also will be banned
this precautions are hard need and we must quickly to act in the important the all european countries
the mr byrne has little said on bse already was this the many sides to asked
i am welcome that we still still a enlargement the the number tests the experimental basis consider
there are still still doubts on the  the the tests with particularly the young animals few speakers have also already out the the colossal extent the the european herd the would must be tested even if old animals from the chain be achieved
the finally must we the council greater urge behalf us the to act
everyone says that and everyone know that the also as is there must absolutely be action
we have just heard that the four year has took for there a ban was the specified removal in the chain
we have not still agree four year the time
perhaps have we not agree a year the time
we must now precautions take not only the for the those the the ensure make but also the for the the few secretary member
this do we the for
mrs the president mr the president mr the commissioner the does i pleased in this chamber to know that the cap expense what the costs changed must be
i like certain people there only just the remind that the greens properly only were when they the fact tone a reform the this cap demanded
what i the is the french decision on the bse particularly welcome but the presidency must not forget also are responsibility to take where the the food in the whole union the
i like in this respect two points the the item to
the first think i the unfortunately that or the council or the commission there the has out that the absolutely necessary is to the contributions for grass and  crops immediately the to apply the the contributions for produces this can we prevent that the deficit the protein next year supplemented must be with genetically modified soya
the second think i that criminal and fraudulent acts not impunity should continue
the is particularly annoying that justice after there in ten year time already three time a bse is been still not few perpetrated has appropriate or persecuted
there must a end to the this impunity
therefore like i that the union also the necessary into done the  and  so those the guilty are the this disaster the health economic and social area be found
mrs the president i would three points to the want to
the first will we the hurdles the the area the control and precautions extremely high to the want we were the the urgent and justified need that the food the the european consumer safe is
if we however the general scale tests to out meal to destroy and  the very herd to prescriptive if a the the animals ill that to are must we also exactly same  demands the third countries which we  have and the live cattle carcasses and animal preparations to the community want export
the second had the community already for this crisis a serious deficit the vegetable protein this situation there already since we in blair  solution with the boundless proposal to our production the fertiliser  crops to to to the our needs to therefore the united states and their  meet to to
currently can and must the community not more than million hectares fertiliser  crops grow while we need have the million hectares
therefore had the  the large scale meal to use in their production
because the ban the meal will this in the future still agree a deficit the millions hectares fertiliser  crops result
this crisis  still agree what absurd concessions the european union in the framework the the gatt has done
time have we this in this chamber still with jimmy  against protests
we have the necessary on the suitable climate and the knowhow to meal immediately to can replace by vegetable  crops the not genetically gm are by  to subsidising have we itself apart the the right to  crops to grow the our own on while this absolutely necessary is to in the food the our animals and our population to for
therefore has our group a amendment tabled which the council and the commission asked the a way to find to the cultivation the this  crops in europe again the the to to this can than a positive replace forms the with prioninfected contaminated meal and the american them soya
also want we that there in the framework the the cap new negotiations to on this disastrous article from the blair  because this our producers the fertiliser  crops serious wish
the third is the the duty the the community to all  in the beef the the victims are the serious disrupted to aid to to we must them financial meet to in the costs the the compulsory tests and the destruction the animal remain the the the chain be from as in the costs for the inevitable 
otherwise can we hardly still the a common agricultural speak
mrs the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen when we in our committee the the work were with the research to bse are we in first body encountered the  secrecy and obviously the we the the denounce had to and lift we have when also measures taken the very many success had and the a the were to a solution the the 
as today already repeatedly was said problem the problem however especially in the transposition the the decisions
mr the commissioner i thank you the i for the fact that you the promise the you the your investiture you done to now to perfectly you fulfilled you you proposals done
i mention here the paper and the  i assure you that the rules in this parliament quickly will be dealt
we will quickly work so this already in the next years efficient can be applied
i see however in the council what that the little movement
i hear only but statements and positions but i see not decisions the in the direction the this directive or this rules to
what i incredibly think is the muck within the council on the imports and exports the meat
that was purely preclude the the conscience
the population was you to only and only the own beef to protect
further is there this nothing happened
now the again vote nutritional by very drastically to have that meal if speaking for all animals the banned
the you however simply to what we have decided than need we on this matter not more to talk
this does i think the the  in the medieval
there be guilty sought the at not guilty are
the causes are somewhere otherwise
i i for to the tests the you itself also the the view you very quickly in to to not if sample but for each gender animal without restriction than can we against the citizens say here is the meat the is investigated and you can the calm eat
a better solution there there however not
i i the costs calculated penny per kg
we need here therefore not on millions to toss
any citizens will that like pay this am i the convinced
mrs the president mr the commissioner mr the minister we must all take the a basic and binding statement
the is unacceptable that materials or restricted food watered forms for human and animal
food must safe are for the human
in this period must we the citizens a strong unequivocal message give irrespective the development and the progress the our legislation
we must the public opinion reassure that the europe the the rights indeed the by the treaties and the charter the the european fundamental  rights guarantees
mr the commissioner i know certainly that there the the on the the parliament all necessary support will are for new initiatives there are clear measures need
i think that a total ban the meal now necessary is to the proof the the opposite is made
also is the need general tests in to to the community legislation to harmonise and in all member the implement to to we must not only monitoring the the the implementation the new standards on labelling but also the discussing the standards so possible to bring
i join the with this principle this measures will certainly many money costs but health is our priority
also will without this certainties the arrival the the consumption a negative impact have the the whole sector
therefore must consumers and producers the together working for the without principle the food
mrs the president i am very welcome that the commission the last clear for tests in the whole european union has expressed france has because just demonstrated that who looking take
mr the commissioner i like you urgent ask ensure to ensure that the tests also in other member be carried
the is not the that example germany not tests the are whole territory effect but there only in the at  the tested simply because the afraid is otherwise not more  to are
that must course not done therefore can i only but hope that the commission heavy pressure the the member exercised the not tests out because they afraid are that they not  are
the consumer deliberate in risk to is for us unacceptable
a broad campaign is here than also the are place
i am the however not agree with the judgement the the commission that the now regulation the a ban the meal must is
contrary
i think the exemplary the france that the this step has dare to
mr the commissioner i think the the cynical that you that that this to environmental not must done
you can however not in all seriousness expect that we waste eat to the  the to solve
i think the already the already what disgraceful that here as many on the compensation the farmers and farmers the talk
perhaps must we also agree think the the victims and the families the people the the dying are died
mr the commissioner i i with large attention listened to what you said i was under the impression the the fact that you somewhere in your speech said not  to have which you everything immediately can solve
my answer is that we not  need have we have but two things need
the first must we fully aware are the the fact that health health over everything is and if we that say must we that also believe
than to we also automatically the the second point rightly the political like
we know because how this in other is we know how the with that morning is we know that there tests are and that the from affected herds originating animals can be effectively the than must be missing to the problem to combat
that know we all
what from you however to action to take must we than time if there a crisis ticking yes to to to to say that for us in the parliament health the matter priority is
also you says that fact but i know not in what extent the council that also believe
if like the like is the there namely nothing done
obviously can we already our science regarding this problem not apply
we know also that prevent the best is better than what than also
very certainly in this case which the cure not there is
we know that this  incredibly many problems caused and tragic still not to incalculable consequences has
not all tests characteristics the this disease are because know
we play therefore with great
i am subjected on the fact that we all here to to to to still again same to say
i i to my mr programmes listened and they have all completely right
where the however to is is that this also the applied
we want that this the hard made gentlemen the the council we want actions in very the european union
we want not measures here and the in france and perhaps still somewhere otherwise no we want measures all here and now
mrs the president i am the conviction agree that in very the union no on the necessary political moral and educational authority has to to speak on quality and food
the is certainly not coincidence that or the president the the council or the commissioner have mentioned the the contributory the already this problems in the chain i mean this course the common agricultural itself
the half the the by the parliament adopted budget is to 
today the day is the modern farmer not what he produces but what he in the is to produce with respect the quality and safety
this farmers help you however not
you help only those the large quantities produce and therefore paying you enormous refuse the the intensification the the current problems not only the the existing but also the future problems
despite you you not prepared the principle to support that animals not cultivate should be with remain the other animals
we have here used already about on the united kingdom and portugal and now is france the the turn
i expect the commissioner already to the next case to discuss because on a year are we here doubt again to a another country and new cases to deal
the is high time that the president the the council and the commissioner that convinced are that we us today the day not more can and should professions the a policy that based is the postwar principles
you must all support the the production stop and in place of priority to the quality food and conservation the the quantities
as not than will the chain the consumer not guarantees offer
in that case will we simply continue with the farmers and the consumers a processthose for the view to work
mrs the president bse like but not disappear from the media
nor if the terrible pictures the people the by the disease the primates are affected despite the many actions the there are been in member but also in europe
the debate that we today to on the consequences the the bse and how we the consequences actually can combat the held the very crucial points
the first is the to the tests the carried must be which i welcome that we this not specific age for determine
the second is the to the already than not use the meal in feed which also here in this chamber a loud debate the held
the link between the to the meal and bse a moreover very  way the the feed the animals is now the for everyone clear
there must therefore action taken be
in netherlands is the legislation for the use the animal relating in animal the this at already reasonable strict
since should protein the exists and ruminant already not more in feed used be that for is for ruminant
the regulation is also constantly strengthened and follows what what there from europe is asked
also the use the fat and blood is the strict rules bound
the surprised i than also that under the circumstances still pathogen used or processed should be
although not absolutely risk is demonstrated welcome i the dutch intention to per july the use the pathogen in feedingstuffs at not more to to are
we can us given the events in the past also not more afford to the pathogen how than also still in the chain to to
i favour with all colleagues to not to wait to july but ensure to ensure that now with almost immediate commit that ban the maintained
the need for strict european measures is obvious
therefore not only national measures because the force the the internal market will serious balance be if we the still but the the national authorities leave in what extent the the use the pathogen also in speaking prohibits
in the important therefore also the the internal market and also to the confidence the the european consumer to strengthen favour i for a complete and immediately ban
with the to the pathogen and the collection that question i now also the the commissioner to this what european  in to to to
we see still more also in us country that a death production or a death  simply be us because the costs the the collection to high are
i question therefore also the that point the the european commission to to to to only extent the harmonisation
if they that now not does than will in each case writing so we know where we the to are
mrs the president i am today if member and if british 
the agriculture in britain has many to suffering had under the bse both in financial respect if what the the confidence the the consumer
we have in the years however the learnt how we our affairs the item must to
we have now a system with double measures the protection the the safety the us beef
recently is the report the the  the the commission  in the united kingdom published
i am welcome that you this report you read commissioner byrne
i hope that you to will act
the french government would this report also must read because they the the risk exactly same mistakes to make if we time during the bse in the united kingdom
we have the the past learnt
i i for that the french government something the us trying to learn
i am never convinced has the the french argument that the slaughter the the whole herd the right way was to the  in their country the to tackle
the recent problem in  the a contaminated animal that if healthy animal was offered stressed the resistance in the enhancement against the slaughter the the whole herd
also have tests the sceptical animals the only in france are carried different hidden cases the bse demonstrated
i i already longer time the suspicion that the farms in france animals in the secret are you and buried to to prevent that the whole herd had be gender
the british system which affected animals from the herd be from and a proper compensation for the animals the paid encourages farmers cases the bse the to give
i i a appeal the the european commission the in france however systems the fight the bse the a carefully research to issues
in britain have we also learnt that the very difficult is to prevent that for processing in pigs and  for meat and meal also in feed for cattle and ruminant ends
the is very difficult for a  to to guarantee that the  fully free the meat and meal are the the at that the production the pigs and  the begun
i am already very long favour the a complete ban the the use the meat and meal in feedingstuffs in very europe
france has recently a ban the beef the the brusque become and many french provinces have ensure taken that schoolchildren not french beef more eat
a the the  for this action is that the french food the principle the precautions particularly seriously the
i like proposals that the european commission this principle also used for beef from from france
as the french government not the absolute guarantee can give that their beef safe is must the commission all implement from france to the rest the the eu to ban with particularly for bovine over than months
currently the there in the united kingdom for a amount the million gbp french beef has by the been industry
this is total unacceptable given the  in france
over a year ago seem the europe programmes best scientists including a french president that british beef safe was for consumption in very europe and however has france the illegal way a embargo the british beef in the taken
that france the ban the british beef in the the witness the hypocrisy
the united kingdom has been ago under this appalling scourge
there the often with the finger to the enhancement out but this is nothing to blame
commissioner byrne was very clear in are opening today when he the parliament his that he prepared was the issue the the meat and meal to into
i like him like questions or he today during the debate not to the aware is has that this issue immediately must be tackled
as the previous speaker already said is the only way to a ban the meat and meal to achieve a complete ban is
the a other way is control not possible with if result that the system water affects and the destroyed
i i today a special appeal the the commissioner to in to to the that what during this debate essentially on the whole acrosstheboard is said and as quickly possible with a ban the all meat and meal in the european union to to
mrs the president gentlemen members mr the commissioner i i with interest to already your interventions listened
the is there today not to that we who than also the debt give the the delays the are in the the legislation or the the take the responsibilities
i think and the address i i to you all that we here a joint task have a task the there from the guarantee the safe food
this have all european consumers right the and that is a task the the authorities both the national if the european level
i think that we today after your debates must try a clear line the to give both terms method if terms resources to this task to properly to role
the method must according the presidency based the scientific research and consultation
we must immediately to know see to to how the best in the area is since we still still in uncertainty situation on the scientific on the the matter and the necessary measures
the second must the viability the this measures be examined including also the treatment the meal and the implementation the tests the
then must this measures quickly be applied and end must a system be up
you has this problems document for document the encompasses let through
what the control the must i you mr the commissioner thank for your words the that that the commission a open attitude has all problems possibly will be investigated and you a rapid up the a european agency for food wishes
controls are however only controls and as also but the slightest risk remains there the fraud misappropriation or wrong use remains doubt how low also legacies in the heads the the people and the image the the whole sector disgrace
i believe indeed that the number tests must be extended this has you all to asked
certain countries are here already the large scale that are
we hope the more and elements out tests the precise selected sheep and 
i see however not in how we the with the current opportunities the any country technical financial and efficient must  to million tests per year from to to
how effective this tests also also should are also they will not all doubt can fears especially this even the best tests and the are there the disease only in the last  can the just for the from and not at the the beginning
there continue therefore doubts and uncertainties but i think that us joint objective and your contribute today us in the to progress to make
this progress is the reason that i already your interventions very carefully i listening the is for i namely necessary that the discussion on the safety the our citizens the european level the held
the is certainly not easy to the this point national laws and european legislation the other the to vote
i think that there overall legislation must to the the this problem a end can make competition can out and the european market the opportunity can give the the full to do apply
believe you i i connection this everything in mind the the further activities the the council and the my contacts with the commission reimposed that the the one line to the the institutions one the the best ways is to a as complex and general problem if the  to solve
the november will the french presidency during the meeting the the council a important  the the to that perhaps the first  can offer for the collective mistrust which the credibility the our institutions in the view the our citizens the the
the is here to the health and therefore to serious events the also if such dealt must be with discipline and openness
mrs the president gentlemen members mr the commissioner i assure you that i the the plan am ensure to ensure that we us also if council this will i the ensure the our double task will doing restoration the the confidence the the consumer and strengthening the the credibility the the european institutions
everyone here has referred the or about on the future the the common agricultural
some have the had on  and the possibility to the blair  to review what only possible will are in the framework the the new 
also like i say that already this proposals not go find i am this the certainly sensitive for
i waiting the the results the your consultation and am that convinced that we together  can guarantee and together the methods and the measures will find to the health the our citizens to guarantee
mrs the president if i in this parliament to i across look see i faces the people the i the last months to my pleased very good i learn know
i am there definitely the convinced that already this people expert are the the area the food
many the you the the already various years with this issue are i think with particularly the the excellent commission the the a number years ago on this matter has into
you the the already longer with this issue are than i and i know how involved you all the the feels
therefore is this debate particularly valuable been for i if the commission that responsible is for health consumer and with particularly food
in this the is i one important thing the namely that the spectrum the this debate especially if the is on the question or there a complete ban the meat and meal must to loop the do to not do and that in a parliament are experts the the area the food
this is a the the affairs where we us on must the
what we in this framework not must forget is the fact that there already a ban the the follow the meat and meal the cattle there
this ban is the law the and this must the the the to the
also is there a legal regulation the force which the down how meat and meal must to be processed also this is a measure the is introduced the protection the the health and the food
if you says that the use the meat and meal in pigs and  must be banned while this animals not room are for bse says you not that you pigs and chicken protects but that you cattle protects
therefore says you that the existing legislation in certain sense inadequate is or not the observed
if the the opinion is that the largescale way the hand the has with the law on this issue says that than not something on the events the the last months and years with the to 
the up a question the the i not agree certainly to to
asking you itself agree the what the answer the this question is
i am the opinion that the legislation the observed and because i the opinion am agree and i believe not that i naïve am believe i not that a very broad ban the meat and meal in pigs and  necessary is
i am however prepared to listen to the arguments the this favour
if people from the member i to tell that the legislation not to properly or not fully the respected must we there perhaps still agree good on give that do we than however not because the scientists us tell that this need is but because the law in the european union not the observed
here must we but agree good on give
i like the now have on the control
the mr whitehead has i asked to more details this and i think that he right has i had here something details the on must are
there is there the two types tests
the first the tests the now already be carried and which the legislation only time ago by the commission under the attention the the parliament is the namely the  tests the are animals in all member the other tests
this tests were intended to the  in the european union the to to that like say to information to obtain
i welcome the fact that france quickly has action and still for only other member is started this tests step from to to than by the law was down
that has now information has and as is the current situation the
france has in all openness information provided on this tests
also that is to welcome and deserves applause
let we agree consider the a other issue the i only ensure concern
if there a massive negative response against the french authorities follows while they correctly have action hope i that this not to reluctance will lead the other member where the same way the action
if they the tests out as in france the the up the animals the the the risk are and the down number tests out will this the same type information that if in france this information will than in the whole european union available to so we the desired decisions can take and the the further can to
the the tests where i the now on like have is the matter something otherwise in other
the are not intended to information to obtain on the 
they are more at the the against the possible affected pathogen from the chain
there the the said that this a very precious matter is that there large quantities pathogen for need are etc
let we us to to the facts
the is not possible with through the the three tests the available are the french swiss and irish tests bse the animals under a certain age the to to
the tests make than a negative result the
the costs a hope money and effort to the tests from to to while the result negative is
what is than the gentlemen the the testing the young animals
the gentlemen is zero if you the i asking
we have however also scientific proof that the animals under a certain age not symptoms the bse be detected
therefore i i the permanent veterinary committee that today while we here speak unequivocally asked this matter to into and to determine how old the animals must are for the tests
i i the on the out the tests the pathogen over a certain age to behind to to or they contaminated are and if this the case is to the on animal from the chain to to
there are therefore young animals the not bse have as tell the scientists us and animals over the age the all the bse are tested and the be from the chain achieved this is a measure to the consumer to protect and to the confidence the the consumer to increase
hence my proposal this route to follow
i am hear to the opinion which the permanent veterinary committee afternoon is i will the opinion next week in the council present to the issue the the age with the to this tests the the item to to
i am the opinion that this the right approach is
there is only disagreement the this point and as i here to i across see the not everyone same position in the is however the important that we all our shoulders something to
the is the important that we try unanimity to achieve on the right approach and that we the the right way the the matter respond and not with the here finger point to others the to the the our response will say that you not enough does to the health and the consumer to protect
if we reasonable certainly are the our matter is the justified a border to draw between what safe is and what not
we must other not injustice spirit the the the the measures the we all necessary consider the objective that is because the health and food to protect and the confidence the the consumer to increase
the finally i i with many interest listened to the comments the my friend the mr patriat just and earlier already has made i see from to a close cooperation with him in the next weeks
i must involved tell that he and i previous week in paris still a discussion on this issue have held i am there therefore the convinced that the parliament the council and the commissioner the friendly way will work to to a solution for this delicate issue to to
mrs the president i would like a very short comment want make to a personally fact because our mr graefe graefe graefe members the my group there just the has accused not to have part the the bse
i would only the next want add there are two french been in this parliament
the mr martinez was member the the first commission the  and i i my mr the are the scriptures set opinion sent the by a minority was supported
we have not the the second commission part to the simple reason that we the participation excluded were the on the the d  and by the reason or the lack this i know the not the this parliament
the best way to not to us to need listen is us not from to invite
how the also they the mr martinez has in a official warning do take year before the first committee
i i seven motions received the on the article member the the rules
the debate is closed
the vote take thursday to at place
time commission
question no the h
the minimum rules for the  the immigrants the council has the december a resolution adopted for the set the priorities in the cooperation in justice and home affairs for the period the january to the date that the treaty the amsterdam the force the where clear if objective mentioned the better cooperation for the  the immigrants
the fact that there the the last time in different member many cases occurred have where the the  the immigrants the most basic rights the the human not respect are makes that the a matter the the by the european commission special in the view taken would must be
examples are the technology the the  the in belgium the death the a  caused has the  the strong  in spain the transport the immigrants the the other preparation be in holds in italy and spain the tragedy the the chinese immigrants the death been are in the port the dover in britain after different times held to are the european territory and the  use the coercion and intimidation against immigrants the  be
has the european commission any proposal for the asylum and immigration to the first that type terrible situation to avoid and the second the  the the member to harmonise and to coordinate with respect the the rights the the human and the agreements the the united nations on ceased and immigration
mr the president also i like my play contribute the this human miracle therefore dated i you that that the most measures the the union the the area the the harmonisation the the asylum will take not only in the action the vienna and in the conclusions the the european council the tampere are the but also to expression to in the scoreboard that the commission the the council and the european parliament has presented
the mentioned measures will in two fundamental stages the implement be the in the first stage the to i hope in june the next year will be completed must common obtaining be defined with the to the elements the the asylum
then must the the long term a overarching common migration be developed
with the view the the the the this integrated system will the commission the the end the this year a communication be to the debate this the the to to
what the legal the provides article member paragraph b the the treaty to up the the european community in the adoption the measures on illegal immigration and illegal residence the the territory the the countries the the union with including the repatriation the illegal resident people
currently going the council the on a first initiative the the french presidency that to objective has a directive on the mutual recognition the decisions to disposal the nationals the third countries the to take
this directive is moreover also for opinion the this parliament presented
the public declaratory the the member have the impression that the existing policies on repatriation not coordinated be and particularly its are
the commission is the believe that with the view the the clarification and the coordination the this policies a important role is play for the readmission the this at the there negotiated on the first community readmission with russia sri sri pakistan and morocco
the commission hopes that in the framework the the budget for the year a financial instrument for cooperation with origin and  in the life will be established that the opportunities the this countries the the area the costs and voluntary return the nationals increase
what the  the is the commission the believe that the integrated and coherent review that we achieve especially voluntary repatriation in the hand must work against this background like i the parliament remind remind that the european fund specific financial measures in the prospect the to the development the the policies the the member on repatriation to support
i part the concern the the gentlemen member regarding the circumstances which this repatriation place there must indeed common obtaining be the which the procedure the defined and the right the humanitarian circumstances and a human treatment the guaranteed
i am that convinced that this issue in the programme the the commission for the year extended the mentioned must to
mr the president i will also a contribution try to make the the paragraph distribution the the time between the commissioners and the members the parliament
mr vitorino you know very good that we your ensure parts and that we behind the work are that you personally the the commission freedoms and rights you to explain we are the agree with the scoreboard and the priorities the your services for already this affairs have the
this work we in our commission because itself the
circumstances as i the in my question the you i described would any european citizens to must they this emphatically attention for to questions and to demands that there as quickly possible the work to repeat to prevent
that applies for us more to more because we political responsibility to and political obligations are made not few the the by i mentioned situations as the deportation the immigrants must the ever still arise because this for us if europeans and more still if political responsible a shame is
mr the president i part the concern the the gentlemen member i hope however that its call not only to the commission but also to the council at is
we must there because together for ensure that the full legal framework end next year can be adopted i promise my obligation this after to to but i can course only but for myself guarantee are
mr the president i like but two comments make
the in the question listed examples are the product the a selective memory and that think i in this type affairs not the positive
how than also mr the commissioner the scoreboard is still still not up and we have nor on a legal instrument which the regulated how and when deportation must place
the december next will the united nations in keeper the  on organised crime sign including a protocol on trafficking
there there a directly the between the organised crime and immigration
what proposals think the commission the this area to do the basis the article the the 
i apologise i again for the excessive fighting which i the earlier mentioned human miracle like help achieve gentlemen member i hope that the commission end this year the the council and the european parliament in the framework the the third pillar two  with common definitions common offences and common sanctions on trafficking with the view the sexual and commercial exploitation can present
this must the first stone be the the european criminal building for fight the trafficking the usually hand in hand is with organised crime
the solutions the the commission think for to to the perfectly the the the content the the convention the the united nations the to i hope in the week the to december in keeper will be signed
question no the h
the abortions on the exploitation the women in a abortions the in the looting see a picture  the the situation the the women in the world
the the that there million girls missing be that there annual women killed be to the honour the the family to save while approximately million women every be to in the sex to work while they the this know to escape forced are work under could circumstances the to take
a important conclusion the the report is that a the the three women the world least once in its life the victims is been the maltreatment rape or forced sex while the perpetrators there normally unpunished the work
what measures think the commission to take to a end to make the this unacceptable situation the scandalous exploitation maltreatment and trade in white kosovo and doubt and put to to the this forms the 
second part
questions the the mr solbes
mr the president the is clear that maltreatment the women violence against women a the the the social problems the this time is
the economic consequences of are enormous large this in very the world important illegal economic activities this the the
the issue the the violence against women from the in different forms violence in the family which usually the question what the the already a crime is sexual exploitation women trafficking
i remind the the daphne and stop programmes last year is also a campaign held in the with violence in house violence in the family
also is in a common measure approved for the fight the trade in human beings and sexual exploitation the children the on of must all member their institutional framework review to account to can the with certain actions and to cooperation between legal authorities to can encourage
the programme that the commission has tabled for the issue the the equality between women and men has five perspective
a of the violence and human this count we the the cooperation the governments local authorities and not governmental organisations in the hope that than in the next five year in all member programme programmes this the implement will be the
i thank the commissioner for its answers
what you says is all good and the but this is the in fact not to
i like its than also the next questions take you mrs the commissioner also not that the terrible things the we here the the denounce to and the as also you just already said the the with the current economic situation in the countries the the european union in the other european countries and in fact in very the world to due are the the misery the the because everything the sacrificed the the altar the the profits the to highest good is declared
in europe to the modern kosovo the good are for everything and still what mainly from the former socialist countries from the countries therefore which the women ever agree a the social position  the its tribute
with the tragic changes where we all as to  have i mean this therefore your system is exports the women and children to our countries the bulk the the exports from this countries
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president only a short comment the is not where that women only place from the former socialist countries or that the bulk this from is
we must unfortunately the that asia the constraint vote followed by the african countries
poverty is the most cause the most factor which this phenomenon the caused
my me the mrs schreyer and the mr fischler but they can impossible still a question answer
the questions and be writing answered
question no the h
the monetary policy and the function the the european commission the a sitting the the commission constitutional affairs the the european parliament stated the former president the the commission jacques delors that the european commission the responsibility must have for the public to expression to the the community policy on the situation and the  the the common currency
intend the commission measures to take to in any case the to count with the differences the as harmful are for the health the the euro
questions the mrs wallström
mr the president i would against the mr nogueira want say that the monetary policy in us model under the responsibility the the european central bank is and that the ecb accordance the in the treaty established criteria doing
a greater problem is how you a common monetary policy with national economic policy can unite according the treaty determine the member because itself their economic policy
that is exactly where the to is the the coordination the the economic policy the two objectives has in the first place must the economic policy the the different member not clash and in the second place must their policy also not clash with the monetary policy or a situation cause the us terms a to restrictive monetary policy to to
we try the coordination mainly to achieve by means the the broad guidelines for the economic policy the the application are in all member the this directives adopt they contain not only the main the the economic policy but also specific recommendations for any member
the result the the the stability and pact have we however also the socalled stability introduced
the model of is many more and specific because the in the programmes only to the public is
we have us the last time the the reduction the the deficit at to a more monetary policy lower interest and a higher growth possible to make
the progress in the direction the our objectives is satisfactory
in this circumstances like the euro the the responsibility for the coordination the the economic policy bears a step further to with the to our tax obligations the group like however especially the quality and the sustainability the the public finance improve
this will doubt the stability and pact must be improve and will  and more content issues must be dealt
mr the president mr the commissioner your answer had the the the european economic policy and the way which the member and the commission the deal
i think however that the current situation the the euro not the the economic policy to due is and that the statement elsewhere must be sought
if i  the your answer would want respond would i this add that the fact that europe systematically dollars buy and huge investment in the united states does i enormous ensure would concern if i that country future
i would also can say that the cheap euro particularly good is for the european exports what not bad is for europe
i think however that you this not know from to to or that you that not dare how this also they the depreciation the the euro is mainly to due the the lack the confidence in a common policy the the on the the member the the strategic and political given that the euro there not under view want see
there is not question the mr solbes
you see the that almost all members the established feel to commissioner to be and us want explain how the is
we know all that we this not time have
i request the gentlemen members than also with the question to start and not with the explanation
mr the president i believe that the for the public opinion very important is that there a distinction the made between internal and external effects i interested the next will the commission as briefly for the actual introduction the the euro still something take to the difference between the internal and external effects the a stable currency from to to
mr the president i will try briefly the both points to respond
in the first place is the precisely that the euro internal and external effects has internal is the euro in the general about a striking success
we are the managed the growth to do increase and the stability the our economy to improve despite the risks the we currently are are we the managed the inflation the a relatively low level to the and the the objective the restrain the the inflation achieved
external given there there however the a problem we must not forget and this give i indirectly answer the the mr nogueira that the  in europe many higher is than in the united states
european companies use a part the the european savings to also outside europe active to be sometimes is the than to european investment in flouted countries sometimes is the also simply to countries or companies the in europe active are and here easier their money deserve and that then outside europe tomorrow
i like however also answer give the your specific question what to we now do
in are we in cooperation with the parliament with a number specific programmes started to the people as good possible with the euro know to make
i say always that the euro not the january the introduced but that we him already in our europe have he there still from different  programmes but we have him already the europe
that point must be stressed
in have we us mainly the the central and small at but must the year the the citizens be
we work the together with the member the responsible are for the specific programmes for the transition to the euro the parliament is this also the involved i refer to the meetings the and october on
behaves to we any month report from the the ecofin we want the member encourage to cooperation the the to the awareness the the euro a awareness the we all want improve
you the also regular to hear how the with the national plans for the physical transition to the euro is so everyone the best methods the other can accept the the way can we together for end next year as many possible progress make and the best possible results achieve
the question no the writing answered
question no the h
the pollution in greece from estimates the greenpeace according the methods the the who has calculated and from the most recent figures on the pollution as measured by the competent public that that in greece same people die the result the the pollution if by accidents annual die by the short and longterm the the pollution respectively people
especially in athens be high concentrations detected the small dust ozone  and  and sulphur
can the commission say or greece has public what executive measures the has taken for the transposition the the directives ec and ec in national right or the  directives correctly effect and in the general what its opinion is on the air in greece with particularly after the many studies the they itself has financed to a solution to seek for this problem
questions the the mr monti
the first is directive on integrated prevention and fight the pollution the latest october in the member presented to be into in greece still not implemented
therefore has the commission the greek authorities recently the its position the the informed the
if the greek side not action the taken to we the already started procedure continue
with the to directive on the assessment and the management the the air has the commission the the court the justice a procedure set against greece because the the directive not has into
during the procedure among the greek authorities know that they now to transposition were have
the commission has the court the justice then asked the matter against the greek authorities to 
a research to the air in athens that was carried in the framework the a project the the commission and the dilapidated the athens has led in the plant the a  to as to meet the the requirements the the  the on the directive
in the research is also the current air in athens assessed
during the  are the certain critical places increase concentrations sulphur noted
the current values for  and lead were not exceeded
the  according directive were in the city athens not exceeded but there must the be the that there central in the summer not measurements are done
other  point from that the  outside athens regular were exceeded
i expect that other community initiatives as the recent agreement on the proposal the the commission for a directive on national emission improvement in the situation will to
also must offshoot latest july in the member to be into
the be future values for sulphur we dust and lead down
according the research are the current concentrations  higher than the limit for  the from the force is and the the new limit for dust the in the force the over exceeded
the recently adopted limit for benzene the also exceeded
in this situation will to expected improvement to if the community legislation the introduced under more in the transport
the greek authorities will the local level however supplementary measures must take to the the new  to can meet
mrs the commissioner i thank you the i for your precise and detailed information
mr the president i will try original to are and you not my position the to insist
i like two small  the the commissioner to you said us that we in certain cases the values have exceeded
are there measures taken from the at that this values were achieved and are you this officially know made
the second be there with the cohesion and the third community framework appropriations the available the for investment the this area you you about on investment the ensure can ensure that in very greece and not only in athens the in the community legislation mentioned  be set
if values be exceeded must the member in issue in this case greece action to take
we ensure ensure that there a control and  is
if values be exceeded questions we the member action to take and follow we the developments
the is possible a financial contribution the the community to obtain for the up the networks and measurements in greece
the is the large important that we the developments regarding the air in very greece and not only in athens in the monitoring the
the questions nos to be writing answered
question no the h
the state for the audiovisual sector during a weighty the the french presidency devoted the the cultural industry was a representative the the directorategeneral competition the the european commission that the the law compulsory investment the the stations be imposed a form the state are this the legislator this investment compulsory has the
can the commission confirm or this view does with its research to state for the cinematographic and audiovisual sector
the resources the by broadcasting under a legal obligation be used are therefore public
the fact that there a legal  there for broadcasting like not necessarily say that this investment state are accordance article member the the  but presupposes the that the commission control exercised under article the the 
the principle that the commission used to to determine or such investment subsidies are and to the informed that to calculate is same principle if that the a private investor the swiftly in a normal functioning market
the buying the audiovisual products for their broadcasting one to the normal governing the broadcasting
the investment the need are to such products to finance be only supplemented with public when broadcasting there not supporting andor sufficient proceeds from can to in the form the very purchase the audiovisual products  or rights
this proceeds can also there from other forms the commerce return the their investment
with other words the investment can supplemented be if they must the financing the productions the without a legal obligation not by broadcasting would are financed
the may clear are that the supplementary subsidy for this productions not the whole financing by the broadcasting the but earlier the difference covers between a normal return and the actual return the the financed production
i would the finally still want say that the preliminary nature the certain investment in the central late or this investment end also meet the the treaties
this depends rather the the the extent which the investment contribute the the creation the a cultural production
fr mr the commissioner would you can clarify why this not contradictory is with the fact that television without borders also support its the the creation the the content the the productions
when the amount the a national subsidy and are territorial use the other be fee think you than not that this lack the den duration the desirability and the the there the national subsidies in risk brings
what is the opinion the the commission this
fact is my problem that i not understand why you with bilateral  working and not with a official text which we the problem in are whole can look in the framework the the treaty example as you just also itself you done
in are decision to approval the the french system for cinematographic has the commission four specific  the
in same decision compulsory the commission the to to the aid in all member to assess the the hand the specific to current  than lapses because the licence for the french system
the commission like with its action ensure ensure that the sector the necessary legal guarantees and regulatory stability  to the to can develop this has the to the date namely must
therefore has the commission minimum  up they is however not the plan the subsidy to harmonise because the diversity of reflect the cultural diversity the the commission like like retain
therefore gentlemen member this bilateral approach is only intended to the the hand the the four specific  to assess in what the existing regulations correspond with the approved french 
the questions nos to be writing answered
today can we in  come say that   
the time for questions the the commission is closed
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
fight the social exclusion continuation
the the item is the continuation the the debate on the report a the mrs figueiredo behalf the commission employment and social affairs on the fight the social exclusion
mr the president mrs the commissioner in the preamble the the charter the the fundamental the the european union the with the institution the the citizenship the the union and the a area the freedom safety and justice puts the charter the human in the centre the are efforts
they must to be respect and protected
the seems i rightly the attention to draw the this quote from the charter the the fundamental because some situations as described in this excellent report which i the rapporteur welcome probably incompatible are with this statement which this parliament time voluntary agreement is has
the before the such statements is the reality obstinate
according data the eurostat must the the population the the european union see the to to with less than the the average national income what means that million europeans in poverty life
the is where that the national   and different are as there also different types poverty there the poverty in the cities in  in remote rural etc or the poverty the issue with discrimination to reason the gender or age which i course objective the the poverty under women and the under the youth
the current world the world the the globalisation and the globalisation the the economy the world the the society and the the technological development would also the agree less positive consequences can have and new forms the poverty can generate or also can do the this because the the this type society inherent problems to the access the the work to increase i i the best way to social integration to achieve and given the need to improvement the the employment and to increase the the quality the the employment
europe has the large scale employment created
in spain my country has the government the josé maría aznar the proper efforts made the this area they is a certain obligation made faced with a situation with a high unemployment has they the that embarked the back to insist a objective which they remains to and the also actually the implemented while the obligation the force remains
i think however not that we pleased must take with this results
to a europe to achieve that the integration promotes is the according the council the lisbon matter that we us joint working and joint action take
a such action is only possible if we know what circumstances and resources for everyone the force can are both in the society in broad sense if in the different governments and if we aware are the the need to the objectives to quantified and the poverty under the youth from to racial because the poverty under the youth would again other poverty can generate and perhaps the the can are to the the the fixed rut the social exclusion which the poverty and perhaps also the misery would be 
therefore mrs the commissioner would i want favour for a additional effort to the poverty under the youth from to racial
mr the president first like i our rapporteur thank and the initiative welcome that they taken has to already in this first reading the dialogue with the council and the commission the to to which better account can be taken with the by the parliament desired amendments
after the  the the years s danger exclusion the new disease to be which europe the next ten year to camps will to
when the prosperity again increasing must we us ask or we want that this  actually everyone the good is
this is not course since this growth very wrong divided is and by can to with persistent phenomena as we the the last ten year in the united states have can see namely uncertainty exclusion poverty and witch in the cities
there is there the a  the place under circumstances the from the where are there the many employment created but still never have so people must work in temporary and fulltime
i am the opinion that we ensure must ensure that the phenomenon the the   also the us recognised the
this economic exclusion is with particularly the certain  often by with exclusion the proper their and the lack the access to health education and culture
this community programme is not intended if the only means which the exclusion within the union must be fight but the must the union in the to to this fight the more speedy efficient and coordinated way to to
the programme must than also closely linked are with the obligation the the state and government in march in lisbon are made what there in the to the steps to i quote the poverty final from to eradicate by adequate by the council for the end the the year line to to objectives to to that like say before the council the nice the on few weeks must place
i am the opinion that the programme only really sense has when the the linked the the achieve the this objective
the what way
in the first place by the understanding the the phenomenon exclusion to increase by the the the  and criteria the the mainly focus the the target
in the second place by more account to the with the experience the  nongovernmental organisations lower authorities social institutions and people the the itself in a situation the exclusion are
in the third place by the influence the the public policy that within the different member the held to help evaluate the end from learn to draw good practices to develop and after to think on right strategies and with particularly on the cohesion with the economic and social policy in the other member
in the fourth place by end the to to the the the the guidelines and national action programmes the the way which this the the employment the luxembourg has place therefore the basis the indicators and broad objectives the part with our should the the model the a social europe
the by the rapporteur tabled amendments the we support are that at the programme in this sense to strengthen
i am the opinion that this amendments in many respects with the the proposals on the social protection the by the group the high officials are tabled the the council employment in the framework the the summit the nice with particularly with the to the intention to the access to sustainable and quality quality employment and the access to social protection and health to improve
a another emphasised the this amendments is a everyone access to proper and benefit their and to essential services in this the as the group the high officials electricity water heating and further real access to education justice and public services
to finally am i the opinion that we the phenomenon exclusion only effective can combat when the access to this fundamental rights for all is guaranteed since this rights condition are for everyone dignity and for a full participation the the civil
mr the president the fight the social exclusion is a political to that we all can support but what must we under social exclusion what and how can this phenomenon the best fight be
what role must the eu to play
in this programme the promotion the the cooperation for the fight the social exclusion must we the answers the this questions find
the is the intention that the member all involved and interested parties involve the the description the the extent the social exclusion and the the actions the they who will take
the basis the this produce must we to a better common  to the is because not as simple the understanding social exclusion to defining
think we example the the longterm unemployed young both if old the the physical and mentally disabled the  poor and disadvantaged
we have may all a another idea on the content the this understanding
a common definition there however
in its document for the summit the lisbon was the commission a proposal for a definition namely that the the social exclusion clearly the people with a income the less than the the average income in the on country
the governments the the member have this definition not accepted they is indeed to simple and not
the problems must more defined to be
the open approach the the problem which the council inappropriate has is to my opinion the right
the is necessary statistics and analyses to make and through conferences and other methods a better common picture to to the the understanding social exclusion
what the specific report the wishes mrs figueiredo the floor poverty in the text in to add
my group is this to formal reasons strong against opposed namely of the elected legal
we recognise course that poverty a source the social exclusion is as from the text that
i think that everyone the this agree is
some members the the group make also reservations the the inserting the the preparatory in the text and the increase the the subsidies but for the rest can we the  support
mr the president i like the rapporteur like congratulate with its commitment the the work the this report on a community action for the fight the social exclusion which as many have said poverty a important role can play
the says that paid work the best way is to social exclusion to prevent but i am the earlier agree with those the say that paid work only not guarantee is for social integration
many elderly will the the agree are as those the affront work for wages the to low are to decent the to can life farmers example
the is unfortunately that the addition the the floor poverty the the title the this programme as controversial is has because the not mentioned the in the treaties
perhaps can the council say or he the plan is this omission during the summit the nice right to to
the fight the poverty is controversial because the the issue the social protection if productive factor and the issue the redistribution the the item the very  concepts in some member
the would useful are a part the the in this report requested increase the the financial resources to to the comparative studies to the management the such developments
i know certainly that many ngos programmes and local and regional authorities the mrs figueiredo in the programme and the assessment that like into like prepared are their expertise to parts
if we social exclusion want prevent must we ensure ensure that us macroeconomic policy not as you that they precisely increasing
the would counterproductive are policy to develop that local economic growth undermining jobs less certainly but demanding makes and then the negative consequences that against to to with programme programmes the poverty and social exclusion combat
mr the president we life in a paradoxical society
within the economic policy do we namely us effort best to the effectiveness speed and dynamic to increase
in the hard climate that as the are there still more people the the not can up the the on to to are and emitted be
therefore how more the economy  how more people the poverty carelessness be
here can you pessimistic the be
although there money is and europe still never as rich is been seems the still difficult to the weakest to protect and the people the the the on are a real opportunity to give
therefore is the  very important and very welcome
i like its the i congratulate with the report
the is on the way which the member encouraged must be to something to do the poverty and social exclusion
what i there with particularly the welcome is that they strong stressed that fine words not enough are and that solidarity money costs
the best is course that there for so possible people work available is but in a economy where hard competition there are there many people the the not save
according the report the the women with a double  the both omitted if home work
the the elderly whose skills not longer need are
the the people with lie problems the the large groups the the language not good enough control to a jobs to to
with particularly the the the many people the work but to little deserve to that to can life
already this groups be threatened with social exclusion if there not very extensive support measures be taken
the member must therefore many more money than now spend the social investment at the exclusion poverty and social problems
i mentioned the paradoxical in the society
the changes ideology is because that people itself responsible are for their own life
i am however the opinion that exclusion and poverty the by the situation in the society and that we therefore a common responsibility have
in a good society must there place are for everyone and this have we a joint responsibility
mr the president still again again the in this parliament the paeans into on the european social model and the social market that the than proud the the according many crudely model the the united states the
the  the the european population live in poverty which the report the based the however a very what less picture picture to see
the most problem is reinvent what there not work in the economy and the society the the european countries and what reforms desirable are to the persistent poverty and social exclusion in many areas the the union see back to insist
what the there proposed in this decision
rights guarantee ensure for mutual harmonisation committees up to the situation to analyse and plans against social exclusion the to to the dialogue between the involved parties promote european networks the ngos programmes create and this to we or perhaps million euro allocate
i doubt not the the good intentions the this decision but i concerned i ensure on the results the we the this fiveyear can expect after end know we the figures the social exclusion and poverty probably better that is a good matter
we will few thousands people in europe have help also that can a good matter are but we will not structural reforms have held while the precisely exclusion and poverty really good can be fight
in the report the made the two problems the unemployment and the low pensions for certain groups
that are two factors the to poverty and exclusion can lead but we must the disease combat and not the symptoms
if we more jobs want must we the european companies competitive make and all the courage have the market to liberalisation
in the european countries where that is happened is the unemployment substantial fallen
in the united states the the flexibility the the market ensure that poverty only briefly take because workers not long out continue
if we funds want kind to the the pensioners with the lowest pensions to give must we the courage have to say that with pension to the secured age not can and probably must the pension the the on the be reformed
without reforms the the market and the social security the must be based the freedom and individual responsibility not the a aidoriented the and trade will our committees and our  not many can do for the poor in the european union
mr the president ladies and gentlemen gentlemen colleagues all technical vicissitudes the sorry like i however speak
the the population the the european union live under the poverty
that are million people and they be often on the head given
they apply not in the picture the the prosperous europe with are high 
poverty the caused by the lack the work to low salaries the socalled  enhanced and  jobs
to the desired economic and social cohesion to achieve is not only a high level the employment need but also a high level the social protection
i welcome the than also to that your commission mrs diamantopoulou
technical interference
i am kosovan mr the president
this must remind contribute to last the exclusion to recognise and experience from to exchange the on the precise qualitative and quantitative data
there is a dialogue need between the keppelhoffwiechert and the relevant ngos
national  and regional and local authorities must the be involved
synergistic the when measures the the member linked be the community policies instruments and actions and with the the the european structural
this result in successful practices with a 
also must networks be up and extended
the third must innovative projects be encouraged
the essential important seems i a preparatory the european level with representatives the ngos the social partners the council and the european parliament the the a annual  would must participate
the concept the the open method in the employment since luxembourg must the also functions to the exclusion and are impact find in national plans the the member
in called the council the member the to the social exclusion to combat
in decided the council to itself the social integration to promote
let we this active role with commit the strengthen and ensure that the people the affected be by poverty and social exclusion access to to the economic social and cultural life
mr the president i am pleased on the initiative the the commission and on this report that the trying to improve
europe is the managed the economic crisis to prevent which a large part the the world in the last years is affected
the economic growth form the the inflation is the the lowest level since a generation but however is there still still poverty and exclusion
the unemployment in europe is with still still many to high
according the last figures the eurostat is more than the half the the million unemployed already longer than a year without work
also live according the statistical service the the eu the the european citizens under the poverty while a third the the poor work has
in my country is approximately the the workers the under the poverty life women
the seems that that the situation reductions
between and is the inequality in the member has
globalisation technological innovation and the turnout the a economy the together with changing    and a still  society
social exclusion is simply a brakes the the economic growth a society which everyone part promotes precisely growth and collective welfare
the commission  that the costs the the unemployment and the wider costs the bad health crime and such between the and billion euro per year can sums
that is a enormous amount
the is absolutely necessary that europe something does the the existing inequality and does that there new the
the consequence the a common currency and a still more the other between economic and tax policy is that social policy not more under the responsibility the only the national jurisdictions is
member must the fully working for this programme and length to strongly to the the civil to ambitious objectives to to for the fight the poverty and exclusion
the first test to to see or the member the programme seriously take is when the parliament must decisions or the funds the to million euro be increased
that is the the already a who amount given the extent the the problem
mr the president i am the rapporteur mrs figueiredo really grateful not only because its usual commitment for this report but also because they few the my amendments has adopted a of the that poverty and social exclusion the consequence are the the miserable  the some states as the mr della della also has said
that is the  that in the  is included
could we social exclusion and poverty but combat
could we the extent that but reduce
each year i i together with the mr programmes thomas mann and mario mantovani to the  in brussels to school to  the the destitute  the the city us heart excessive any time again and we feel us guilty that we that but a time per year do we would the like any day do but that can we really not
this important decision must we the least partially try to achieve
i am i aware the the good like the mrs figueiredo the the commission and in the particularly the the commissioner mrs diamantopoulou but i repeat still agree what i already in the commission employment and social affairs i said we must put with programme programmes the social exclusion combat
on five year and i hope that i than still in the european parliament is like i that we us with other programme programmes deal
the is enough been with the fight the the poverty the poverty must for agree and for always disappear
mr the president to to start like i the rapporteur thank for a excellent report
we have the had on the current very good economic development with many growth less unemployment and more employment
same see we to my opinion in all eu that there still greater gestures the addition the gestures the already since the period the upon there
from that that the policy and the traditional employment not adequate are
there must more policies to to exclusion and poverty to combat
the is a multidimensional problem
course is the policy a part of
the is important that the unemployment decrease and that the employment increasing but that is not sufficient
the policy must there also the involved be with particularly with the view the the new society because knowledge important is has everyone there right the
also is the policy a important area
in certain situations example if someone small children has out is ill is or over the must the not as are that the poor or social excluded the and outside the society is to are
also the  is a important area
as is the right the housing essential to part to can take the the social life
also must all political levels involved involved be
we are used the the local regional and national level
we know however also with the view the the current economic situation with the crossborder economy that the necessary is to the european level to act order a added to create and not to this issue to the european union on to transfer
therefore is the process the this programme important as the link the different policies as in lisbon discussed is
this discussion will the the meeting in stockholm be continue and the in that we the policy the policy and the policy link the the economic policy
this whether a programme if this that the address the the fight the exclusion and poverty the excellent
mr the president eurostat late there not doubt on there that almost the the population the the european union the with less than the the average national income must to
the is the to approximately million european citizens
the last ten year absolve the national  the for denmark and netherlands to a worrying for portugal
this is still the that million people on are the social assistance and that the situation in the most member reductions
this report is extremely important because the at is the improvement the the living the the most deprived groups and that is again a step in the direction the promotion the the social cohesion
therefore like i the rapporteur congratulate wish
the is a ambitious community action that accordance the proposal the the commission five year will take and which appropriations the gentlemen the million euro will be allocated
given the procedures and the current situation the this area must this amount to be increased
to a comprehensive study the the phenomenon poverty and social exclusion to can make and a more and more policy the fight the this phenomena to can up must the dialogue with nongovernmental organisations and other social partners be promoted
the must there warned be against the lack financial mechanisms the nongovernmental organisations and must there a better control called be which guaranteed can be that the public resources the a reasonable and rigorous way be used
this programme must at to are the the victims the poverty and social exclusion and we must prevent that the in the practice only but that to to to financing for institutions the the problems on poverty and social exclusion want into
mr the president my congratulate the the rapporteur for its excellent contribution the the analyse the the causes and extent the the  the understanding poverty a relevant strong term for a cruelty social reality must not be confused with a comprehensive but however abstract understanding if social exclusion
i support the commission in its initiative to a programme to create that meets the the objectives the the new social agenda the the treaty and that giving the the the decisions the lisbon
i hope that the in this report mentioned proposals which sufficient unanimity is achieved be adopted
i i a appeal the the council to quantitative objectives the to to and specific crossborder actions against exclusion the to to the based are the relevant indicators so the reinforced cooperation into can be in specific and effective actions more from social considerations than from considerations the electoral nature
i support the need to insight to to in the underlying causes the poverty i support the preventive actions against exclusion the result the mergers industrial changes mobility wave the the rural and excessive  with innovative and specific answers which the social partners the local and national authorities and the joint  involved are
mr the president in the first place join i i the the the congratulate the mrs figueiredo for its work that we in the commission unanimously have approved and because the innovative content the its report on the the the a community action to the social exclusion to combat
i am the agree with the emphasis the the rapporteur the the a greater social cohesion if objective the the programme for poor and social
as that from the amendments the i in the commission i tabled and the later are approved am i that convinced that for a effective and specific fight the poverty a exactly timetable and objectives need are
if the programme deadlines and controls contains can the better be quantified and qualified
we must not forget that more than million europeans which million italians the a low income must those in italy mean we with a low salary mrs the commissioner that a family with a income the euro must survive
that like say that the for the programme available resources absolutely not enough are
i hope therefore the a increase
mr the president to finally must i the the heart that the solidarity between countries a gentlemen is the if basis must must for a done fight the the poverty and social exclusion the must we there account that the that in a social  economy more and greater social justice certainly also promoted the by a greater prosperity thanks economic growth in the member
mr the president i like mrs figueiredo like thank and congratulate i thank also the other absent members the the parliament the the opinion the the other committees have expressed
the is a important and constructive contribution the the proposal the the commission for a joint decision the the council and the parliament to the the a community action the fight the social exclusion supports
after the treaty the amsterdam and few months after the council the lisbon know we all that there a new context is created for community action the the area the social policy social exclusion and social protection
the political debate the european level is the the until and we see that there a strong like is to social cohesion and competition to combine
the proposed action has if legal article the the treaty the amsterdam and the the council the lisbon have we a new mandate been
this programme is intended to the implementation the the  to support that means that knowledge can be increase opportunities for information and good practices can be developed and experience can be evaluated to social exclusion better to can combat
there was a particularly interesting debate on the role the employment the the fight the social exclusion and the role the social and structural reforms
there was a discussion on the definition the poverty and social income
the is clear that the gap between poor and rich wider the but unfortunately enough can i not the this discussions like i must i up the the proposed programme and the the way which we will work to this programme the european level in to to
i can the members the the parliament inform that the commission employment and social affairs the december will debate on the new social agenda and on the results the the last year
the will a interesting political debate be with social exclusion in the centre the the attention
what the the proposed programme and the report the the parliament am i particularly welcome that you the proposal on the whole taken as strong supports
i can the most the your proposals in their whole or to the spirit accept
i am the agree with your proposal to the reference to the conclusions the the european council the lisbon to strengthen
i am the also with you agree that the important is the knowledge the social exclusion and poverty to increase and the use the similar indicators and assessment to promote
and just if you like i the important the the ngos programmes and the regional and local operators stress and think i that their practical more attention must to
there is something said on the use the the floor poverty
you know that there a political and theoretical discussion on the floor poverty way is
social exclusion is course a wider understanding the has three  poverty discrimination and lack the opportunities
but i am the with you agree that poverty political given a very strong term is and that we where possible poverty the social exclusion can add in the text the the proposal
unfortunately can we the not use in the title the the programme
that is a  problem because in the text the the treaty the only to social exclusion referred and not to poverty
i can i also find in the amendment that the important the cohesion between all relevant policies stressed and in the amendments the the committee for the social protection mention
a important point is that the commission a exceptional meanwhile for european  the active are the the area the poverty and social exclusion has approved the community share in the financing of the now maximum
a increase the the budget the to million euro can i however not accept
the budget the we proposals is appropriate the the objective the the programme namely the member encourage together to work and the other to learn but not projects finance
the ngos programmes from the member can money for specific projects and  to through the social fund and the equal
the remaining amendments can i to different reasons not accept some because they not meet the legal requirements some because they problems call the outside the framework the the decision to the the this programme the and some because they our message would confuse
i come now the your proposal the the commission to the supplement the the  a preparatory the to up
this proposal can we not accept because the against the underpinned is
i like to the the your comments however the next pragmatic proposal do i am the namely the with you agree that we a way must find to constantly and closely together to work
we are already agreed that the committee for the social protection regular with the you the the parliament will meet
the committee for the social protection plays a key in the development the the policy the the european council
close cooperation between the you and the committee for the social protection means that the exchange between the council and the parliament guaranteed is
the the other on would also the you and the officials the the commission regular meet can to
they can than the mind exchange and the permanent basis work for the  and the european social fund have we already a such cooperation between the parliament and the commission the the the
that was a success and on the results are we very satisfied
to finally like i answers the your comments on the involvement the different operators and institutions the the introduction the this programme
i i for the proposed annual round table in coordination with representatives the all the european level active institutions for to prepare the european parliament the committee the the region programmes the economic and social committee the social partners and the european networks the ngos programmes
this proposals are a pragmatic answer the your request
to procedural and institutional reasons can they however not in the text the the decision be included
the the amendments the you has tabled can i there therefore whole or to the spirit accept namely the numbers and
also can i parts the the amendments and accept
if last like i the important the simplified procedures stress
during the debate has you especially on about
the is where that the procedure complicated is but all three the institutions want as quickly possible a compromise achieve
this is what the commission will try to do we will the procedures as briefly possible try to the
i thank you you mrs diamantopoulou
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
promotion the electricity from renewable energy
the the item is the report a the mrs been behalf the commission industry external trade research and energy on the proposal for a directive the the european parliament and the council on the promotion the electricity from renewable energy the the internal electricity com c cod
mr the president gentlemen colleagues in the before report is the as just already is said to the promote the electricity from renewable energy the the internal electricity
we are the in the first legislative the the area the renewable energy
commissioner the palacio i like you and the staff the the commission like my thank express for the submit the this proposal
the proposal for a directive is a logical result the the strategy the the european union to the share the the renewable energy in the total energy for to double
you see the the report the the commission that we the agree are with the strategy as the in the draft divided the the to far not on to to to european harmonisation the aid but this focused the national objectives the the member on to let
that we the with the strategy agree are like however not say that we the with all details agree are
in the report the the commission be i i important and necessary changes the the directive proposed
first still few comments ex the is here to the promote the renewable energy
for many they that to subsidy to support to financial development
but aid are the the win the electricity from  from when from biomass only but need because we currently still always directly or indirectly other forms subsidising there is there the competition because the the area the energy in the past subsidies are granted and sometimes still always be granted the energy the the environment taxation as fossil energy or the large risks with the would as nuclear energy
the promote the renewable energy is therefore nothing otherwise than a compensation for the external costs the other energy which account the taken with the positive consequences for the environment the this forms the energy have also is the a  the the existing such competition
as the internalisation the the external costs for electricity the fossil and nuclear energy not is implemented and as other energy be subsidised are  for renewable energy necessary
what the the before proposal for a directive and the draft the commission the indicative objectives for the member for
only when from interim reports clear the that the objectives not meet the the overall strategy the the european union would there possibly individual and binding objectives for the member be up
so time have we not
we must the binding objectives now have
the european union and all member are in kyoto obligations made because they  how dramatically the consequences the the climate are
in den hague be currently the western countries again the the pilloried pilloried because their codes attempts the made commitments after to to
the the outside doubt that renewable energy essential can help to the in kyoto established binding  for greenhouse to achieve
if the commitments obligations seriously intended were than is the however for the hand to obligations the to to for the working the instruments the help the the obligations to meet to more this i confirmed by the commission the council and the member however a very end 
this binding national objectives must within a year to be up in consultation with experts the the member
the have the member the possibility to the precise informed the their  the the achieve the the objective the the union to determine the the hand the the principle the the shared burden in this cohesion would i moreover also want speak the shared opportunities
a second important demand to amendment the commission is from the a addition other there the different objectives for a period the five year
when we a clear binding framework for the member defining than must the different systems the the finally the this demands must meet more time to to the to proof
after ten year can we than very good assess what system the most successful and the most efficient is
we want the people in europe that convince that they must move the forms the energy the the nature daily again the available the the the environment and the climate not upset and a positive contribution make the the reduce the the co
fact would there therefore not controversy should there on what forms the energy we the mean and if  defining
the can therefore however really not as are that we the people in our regions in all seriousness must tell that we waste that now for a large part there from plastic if renewable source as
must we they perhaps also still call to still more the this waste to produce so we also certainly know that we our objectives will achieve
i need not to say that we the the way ourselves and the policy the the eu in disrepute would to
i am not against incineration i question in the report even to a individual proposal for a directive this
the am i there just if the commission the against to in a law false labels to label
you see that in the draft separate  waste is included because this involved should
you see that untreated  and  if renewable energy be as
and also already the energy but to  in the aid included any form the energy is course a renewable source and the included the the achieve the the objectives
i like still a time clear to incineration is not renewable source and can therefore also not contribution make the the achieve the the objectives
still a essential point where the commission that has agreed is the problem the the following the the network and the access to the  for renewable energy
the proposal the the commission to the renewable sources priority to to know the the access to the  the not the discussion
the this point are we the believe i with other agree
however is the the point the the unjustified the quite general text the the commission in the report very what more made
this was necessary because only as legal the created and  be avoid
this are the essential points which i today us position wanted reflect
i hope that this house tomorrow with this proposal with us position a step forward will do and that you us behalf the commission can tell that you prepared you our amendments on to take and that the council than then are responsibility the the can take
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes mrs the commissioner these days are in den hague the different parties meet the participate the the sixth conference on the climate
a summit the to objective has the climate to to and the the  will are for the protocol the kyoto
further warn the scientists the the intergovernmental panel for the climate us in their most recent conclusions for the alarming consequences the the change
the renewable energy are certainly not panacea to this problem the world from to help no doubt there however the that they in considerable extent can contribute to the under control to the this problem and to the diversification the energy and to the to the our dependence the hydrocarbons what us now fact not bad would it
i like stress that the commission and with particularly the commissioner very rightly the before directive the promotion the electricity from renewable energy have proposed
we confidence that that the directive will contribute to the development the this still functions energy so they competitive will can be and further are we in pending the a similar proposal on biofuels
further like i demonstrated give the my gratitude for the intensive work the mrs been and like i its the congratulate
the report that we tomorrow will adopt change that the parliament this initiative the full supports and i request mrs the commissioner this support on to to the the members the the commission because the is probably in the institution and not in the parliament that this directive and other directives the same commendable objective achieve the most under great will to to are
i think the in the particularly the the proposal for directives or aid the propose the the environment
that is a unacceptable document because the the preempting approach the the operational aid for renewable energy and for alternative  this approach the because not account with the different  between the renewable energy and the traditional energy
nor the there account taken with the external costs the can be against the the use the this type energy
further is the unthinkable that the directorategeneral competition the the affairs forward would are by such support to regulate without the outcome the the discussions on the before directive in eligible to take what the are least said not sign the respect would are towards the parliament
i like than also say that both documents joint must be dealt
to us believe will this directives if they not be amended a particularly negative impact have the the environment
in my country spain would the the this directives are to to write that there the now to the year million tonnes  additional the emitted in the atmosphere and that we the objectives the kyoto not can achieve
the directive on renewable energy the a choice for the future and a investment in the environment
and investment in the environment should not be as from the view the savings or from that the the competition
mr the president i congratulate mrs been
majority the the part the the energy the the this at in the world the used is renewable energy
how see we because day where we across to
conserve the by more people used than to the just what other source
but evening discuss we on a step use the renewable energy
i will three the our demands repeat
clarity is essential when we us position the the council present
we want binding objectives for reduction not indicative objectives a rational definition the renewable energy energy from waste that any incinerated would be is a good idea
but mixed waste old   packaging and disposed plastic toys are not renewable energy
for energy from waste is a other directive need as mrs been says
in the third place want we a reasonable and therefore longer period which we there certainly the can are that renewable energy compensated the for external costs the the society thanks the use the this energy saves
i like like finish with a astonishing fact
the united kingdom would four time are  can mobilise with through the only  four time are 
mr programmes this is a sensible directive
mrs the commissioner thank you for your efforts
i hope that you the our will support
president commissioner colleagues the proposal the the commission to a framework to create which the share electricity from renewable energy in the european union the medium term considerably can increase can only but be welcomed
the efforts the the rapporteur mrs been has made to the position the the european parliament the clear to make deserve than also all appreciation
this directive is because one a important element in the series the measures to the by the european union in kyoto commitments commitment on reduction the the greenhouse to can achieve and hand a regarding attempt to the dependence the the european union the the oil countries to reduce
in the current circumstances must recognised to be that the renewable energy only form the financial support need have so there for fair competition can be taken
this subsidies must i i however the reasonable are and should only for a certain period be paid
the explosive flashpoint in this report is course the set the the binding objectives
the essence the the report is in fact the sense or the nonsense the this binding objectives
i favour for a realistic approach a approach the based is the the science that the production from renewable energy never a substantial part can are in the total energy
the set the realistic objectives can only but the confidence the the citizens increase in the to to energy
if the objectives not binding can be made than creates the false expectations with particularly by to do if the the improvement the the environment our without the to can achieve
this is its the expense the the environment its the expense the the credibility the the policy the before the the citizens
to finally would i what the  the there however the want point mr the president that if the to separate  ratify the also to separate  can move and that the separate  absolutely if a type renewable source must can apply
mr the president mrs the commissioner mrs the rapporteur there is a clear definition need the what  means
plastic applies not if renewable resource nor if peat
we risk the confidence the the european citizens to lose the green electricity will want buy if we for disquiet ensure by ridiculous definitions the to to
there are clear national objectives need
i am the not agree with the mr beysen a liberal would however precisely for as less possible disrupted must are
if there not clear objectives are the there such relations between the countries the active are the the area the renewable energy and the countries the that not are
what the support instruments the agrees the commissioner the behind the position the the parliament that reads the is still to early to in this stage a choice to make between the two existing instruments to know the system the the  one and the system the the guaranteed prices hand
since the favour the the advocategeneral for the court in luxembourg is the risk that the guaranteed prices if result the aid the the authorities be progress smaller become
but this threat can still always the by the compatibility with the internal market
to my opinion is a politician someone the the problems must respond
i think the undesirable when   between both systems cause and the investors in europe disquiet and doubt good by the system the the guaranteed prices by means the tricks to were
guaranteed prices must not only be allowed they must also by means the a directive be guaranteed
that is where the in the political to is competition between both instruments possible make by guaranteed prices to guarantee and by all certificates to harmonise
renewable energy is a subject that the european citizens regard in a time which europe effort has to the citizens the a wider integration to involve
i am the opinion that a strong policy the the area the renewable energy a symbol is for the europe the tomorrow
mr the president the dependence the the eu the imported energy is large and the still greater
the dependence the fossil fuels means dependence the imported energy and the political decisions the third countries
the use the renewable energy increase the freedom and independence the the peoples and is compatible with the principles the the in ecological and social respect sustainable development
with the up the the report has the down what renewable energy are
without a opinion to give on or peat the or not renewable source is think i that peat if fuel in the energy used must can be the prefer the electricityheat
peat take the especially in the nordic countries and the countries must the possibility have peat to incineration because peat a own source is and the european dependence the imports reduce
the the incineration that the co but that the always the the incineration the fossil fuels
the countries the itself oil or gas incineration should us not ban peat to incineration
if we not peat incineration incineration we oil or gas
we make others not i that the emissions the co decrease by the incineration the peat but peat is a own fuel while oil and gas imported are
waste is not renewable natural resource although this any day still more the the
the gas the sites can be incinerated but the must the amount waste not let increase to but more gas to can incineration
president commission and rapporteur formulate rightly  for the promotion the electricity from renewable energy a speedy approach in be is moreover is
the like i special attention questions for the effect the the to achieve competition the the countries
by lower wage and a lower level the environmental have they 
that would the prices can express
logical result is than again a financial increase the the aid for sustainable energy
meantime is given the the diversity the energy a good definition the sustainable energy essential
as must incineration not without more sustainable be mentioned
the this process to because also harmful substances free
hence also my amendment to the strict standards the annex the the revised directive for incineration to apply
by standardisation the the on the the output the innovation the necessary area
the finally with this agreements must the european countries up that they will contribute the the implementation the the 
that support i the i because  a threat forms for the flora and fauna the earth
also should the resources in god creation not increasingly be towards by a limited number rich countries
mr the president this weekend have the  in vienna meeting and they are to the conclusion has that there not increase the the  will to
we have in the last months the prices for raw oil see increase the country to country per 
the would pure unipolar are to still to want deny that we us now already in the third crisis since the second war are
the first crisis the was a political the the also the current crisis has a permanent nature because everything fact that that the reserves the long after not as large are if the us like do believe
this is also from different studies has
if witness can i here even the former  oil sheikh oil because the only ago the the austrian television has said the  approaches are end perhaps not agree much by lack the oil but the the glint is per finally the account also not end has by a lack the stones
we can the one primary source oil not replace by a other because than would also the already quickly again scarce be
oil can not be replace by coal gas or uranium
this given its this directive the this at a intangible events
same offers the however a historic opportunity to the renewable energy the itself constantly  namely when water such and biomass their place in the future chisinau to give and the to different reasons the protection the the environment to social reasons for the create the jobs with the view the the  because we to wars because the primary energy and that since a century still again and the finally because they also economic given a enormous opportunity forms for the countries
mr the president mrs the commissioner we support the directive for electricity from renewable energy the i
we see the if continuation the the work the our mr mombaur in the directive the there because for favour that the european union a greater part the its electricity and energy from this sources gaining
the misguidedly in the parliament are clear quite state on the definition the renewable energy example
many the us find that energy from waste the must be included
that is a valuable source and a source the itself certainly any day  therefore must the be included
the would unfortunately are a category from to the the can contribute the the total amount energy the from waste the won or the now for smallscale projects is or part the a 
the most move is however the binding nature the the objectives
we have serious reservations the the is because contrary with the subsidiarity
our left and green friends questions the this point to many
the would not only this directive can wrecking the is also a practical problem
the this objectives is there a odd large crop between the member the to almost
that seems i a foreign way to the the to tackle therefore we think that the commission rightly for indicative objectives has elected
the third point is the length the the programmes programmes
we are favour the a shorter period followed by a assessment i would my mr mrs mcnally that want point that they a about picture  the hurdle in sea but the technical problems and the costs that make that this a option for the far future is just if hydroelectric
but i support this proposal the i
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen colleagues i thank mrs been for its good report and its sensible action the is course good more use to make the electricity from renewable energy
the share the the electricity trying the now therefore in ten year to double that would best still more should are
however the the dependence the the union the imported energy to large
the share the imported energy is on year even
that the for uncertainty in us life both in the economic life if the general level
to my opinion have we addition the development the renewable energy also a modern  need because the dependence for us also a issue the safety start to be
peat the still again the
the training the  in the  and the  is the same way if the other vegetable 
in place the hundred year as the wood has peat thousands years need to the to succeeds
we have especially peat need in the eastern and northern parts the my country where all other fuels except wood the far must be achieved
we want not only coal and oil incineration and only of on are
for us is a annual  for peat already sufficient and fact already to many
we get as forest and conditions almost if sacrosanct and are in the they accordance the principle the sustainable development to use
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes the use the energy from renewable sources must also in europe a the the most objectives the a modern energy are the obligations and certainties the must course the the healthy sense testify
in the sense is electricity from water important the is a terms and same a disaster for the people the mountain they have a high price paid for their country and have the beginning the the industrialisation the the region with through the this breathing seen
this source the is  must now as good possible be use without the environment still more to harm but also must the people the mountain compensation be the and their possession back
with this directive to we course the good on the last a serious exploitation the renewable forms
mr the president i like mrs been like thank for its excellent report the is exactly the the good at precisely now we struggling with the problem the 
commissioner we have the certainly a problem a corporation for renewable energy
the would the agree can that renewable energy openly that to are or the the birth the without the turned by services with a monopoly if this high tariffs can questions for access to the corporation
the a farmer in my village with a  was more than  million asked for following this is a problem that course resolved must be
i like the commissioner also like let know that ireland in short time competitive wind can make
we think that we competitive can work provided we enough support to in the  access to the corporation one this also to
the mr chichester would i want say that the i for the coast already a  in a advanced stage is the project will within not already to long time certainly in are company are
i like him than also invite to the to to government when the far is i am that convinced that he the interesting will find
mr the president to to start is the a good matter that the share the renewable energy the the total energy the increased
this the for the year a percentage proposed the what very ambitious is in compared with the current percentage the we questions us than also the or for the need the this objective a directive the enough very certainly when the directive is focused the the market and not accompanying measures the as the support the research
we must us also seriously ask how the additional production will be covered
in the directive is there the brought the contributions therefore fact for the companies the in this sector working are but if the the the final solution comes leave the directive the the the mechanisms
this means in fact that the workers end the who must pay for this contributions the the companies from the the costs and the profits the this companies what course never the case would are if the energy and distribution in hands was the the authorities as the communist party the greece necessary and not was privatised according the reason the the big
therefore believe we that the intended objective impossible achieved can be with the before directive
mr the president i thank mr been for the valuable work that they with the up the this report has done
the promote the the use the electricity from renewable energy is without more to to welcome
the dependence the the european union the imported energy the the next year however already considerably to
since the european union same must to the the  the kyoto is the the large important that there in increasing extent in the research to renewable energy the invested
i am satisfied that the new directive account the with the importance the under other biomass peat and other materials the from wood are the
the debate on renewable energy must not populism against electricity from nuclear be
the must aware that only the use the nuclear and renewable energy the possible makes to meet the the obligations the the climate the kyoto
the plans in under other sweden and germany to the nuclear the to see have demonstrated that without environmentallyfriendly and competitive  in the prospect the debate necessarily incomplete is
also the full liberalisation the the electricity is a condition for a increase the the use the renewable energy
the artificial trade and restrictions the companies with a monopoly must lifted be
example the cheap electricity the in the nordic countries with through the energy the using has in the current circumstances still not international access to the central market
president colleagues you know all the fight the tilting  against the hurdle
are fight against hurdle the for a has or impossible fight against everything what course is
unfortunately hurdle are now not course a the the facts the today is precisely the subsidies the the fossil energy
the fight against this subsidies seemed quicker work
but this time is the fight for the hurdle and therefore will the also success have
if social find we that sustainable energy a fair opportunity must to
sustainable energy can contribute to a fair distribution between countries
consumers must fair choices have
sustainable energy offers also a sound basis for the economy
the fight for hurdle is there therefore a without losers
we had not better at for this debate can choose
the  in den hague is just the start has
our objectives the the area the sustainable energy are ambitious but in the context the the scenario are we however still modest
radical technological adjustments are need
than must you not to temper with the definition the sustainable energy to as easy possible the you objectives to meet
sustainable energy the often associated with smallscale solutions everyone a  the are side and in each village a 
that is beautiful but sustainable energy requires also largescale investment
to the financing for other to to is commitment the the authorities need
there must a certain market are for sustainable energy vagueness meets in this case not
therefore must member binding objectives have
this must  are because sustainable energy must imported and exported be so each country optimum are benefits use
also must objectives mentioned be for the  because that is a incentive to also per member all opportunities to use
president to finally would i like the rapporteur want thank for its good contribution the this subject
mr the president also i like the rapporteur thank for its excellent work for this report
by cooperation is a very good proposal to the the
the in the commission approved definition the renewable energy is reasonable managed and enough also peat the included as many mr here convincing has demonstrated
by more use to make the renewable energy can the the dependence the oil reduce and also in the sparsely regions jobs create
also is the a good way to the emissions the greenhouse in the community to reduce
the is to my opinion good that the what the objectives the the hurdles high the the most is however that the the credible way binding agreements on the joint objectives must can make which the rapporteur already earlier referred
i think the a good principle to with the directive a framework to create for the increase the the share renewable energy in the electricity
although the take the decisions on the necessary measures and the implementation that the the member the left is there also a increasing commitment the the union need
mr the president late there not doubt on there that a combination the investment in renewable energy and efficient use the energy the only realistic way is for the european union to the objectives the the protocol the kyoto to achieve and our large dependence the fossil fuels back to to
i congratulate the commissioner with its initiative and mrs been with its report
i would want that the directive part was the coherent  the the union
but that is not the case
in place of be proposals on energy individual tabled and there they not many cohesion
that is not your mistake mrs the commissioner
the is mainly the the member
our efforts to the  in the union to reform will not success be if energy including taxes not part the the a common policy
the problem the the different programmes programmes in the member where the mr chichester to referred is but one example that the that there more common must be regulated
to finally something on the costs
new technology is in the beginning always duration
but experience the almost each area from that the costs a estimated to fall when the question with rising
renewable energy is this not exception
i would you  and figures can let see the demonstrate that this  formula both the wind if the  energy direction
therefore am i optimistic on the future potential for renewable energy the condition that the right measures be affected
mrs the commissioner i wish you all possible success
mrs the commissioner us debate is various have the already said the evening very the now in den hague the  the taken
everyone is there the now the aware that the humanity the faced with something what not limited remains to few generations
currently affected we the negative consequences the the greenhouse the climatic denying and the warming the the earth short a whole series problems which we now specific to make to and the urgent questions to radical measures
mrs the commissioner the good proposal that you you tabled and i welcome your realistic in be to and the excellent report the our mr been to in the right direction by promotion the renewable energy possible to make
when we this dossier into see we purely interests or the now is to the guarantee the the supply the protection the the environment the fight the the greenhouse or to the create the employment
there there not doubt on that we to a solution must to course the condition that we prepared are to this to finance
also here be the restrictions the the market visible the freedom the competition offers not solution for all problems and certainly not where the is to the fight the the greenhouse and the the 
the states must now the their presented proposals accept
we must in overwhelming majority the proposals the mrs been approve
i like like conclude by three problems the the item to to the the during this debate have occurred
the first problem the the peat the a important source is what i the is this not renewable source
the second problem the the domestic waste this is not really a renewable source but we must ensure ensure a negative signal the to give the regard the the incineration the domestic waste
the third problem you in the extent the  to the simple to say since my time the is the fact that a objective never binding is the is a objective and everything must in the work be the to the to to
that is what we the european level must do
mr the president first like i like mrs been thank for the  and  way which they in this dossier to work is has
there is according i many courage for need to renewable energy still again the place to give where they right the has
i come just back the a sitting the the opec and a price the country for raw oil offers us the opportunity to fully new investment the this area to do
precisely the the area the research and development is the important that we us in the future still more with renewable energy to deal and that especially also the gases they the from the landfill or the  the not be forget
i think however that also public not must be forget because efficient and efficient energy for us in the future absolutely necessary is as the use the a efficient infrastructure
mr the president in the first place like i mrs been congratulate with the excellent work that they with the drafting the this report has done and further with its willingness to a consensus to achieve
i am that convinced that we good must aware that we what all  the for the choice are to or the energy to improve than the the planet earth within few generations  to make
to my opinion is the the fundamental important that we the support for such sources on a considerable period work which we us business in the opportunity to to the long term crucial investment to do in this alternative energy
i eight the necessary that there a stable framework the guaranteed the promotion the the  from renewable sources on a reasonable the least ten year and that proposal deserves us all support
what the our objectives the this area is the matter that we respond give the the wish the the citizens and that we further to than the proposal on the that i if whole particularly positive think and that the share the the renewable energy in the total amount produced electricity the increased
the on the the principle the coherence must the mentioned objectives into in national parameters fact binding to are because otherwise would the content and the importance the the directive the the put to to are
that binding nature is also the essential important to the to show that the european union also what the environment the its international obligations seriously the
to finally must said that i i that aware am that this everything easier said than done is but if we now not immediately action take training we within few generations a heavy debt the us the us the destroying will breaking
let we our solidarity express with our descendants and their a inhabitable world fail
mr the president to to start like i mrs been congratulate with the excellent work that they has done same applies for already those under the gentlemen members the the floor have held and the who many also amendments have tabled the the text the the parliament and the council is presented
this proposal the the commission the us presented under a number circumstances the i although in many respect may for our economy and us personally life for the before initiative precisely positive seem
by the enormous increase the the oil be we doubt with our to the the problems well the the the with our dependence the fossil energy
strategic objective the the directive is the up the a stable framework which the medium term the electricity using from renewable energy in the european union in considerable extent can be promoted the is to the socalled green energy the more must be made for the european electricity
the is however matter that this order the were first must the production the green energy to be extended and then must the issues with the to the market be tackled
the before proposal offers a certain security on the legislation while same the subsidiarity the respect because the member the necessary independence the granted to account to the with their specific circumstances until from the developments that what the best way is to the release the  to encourage
i like mrs been thank for its support the this principles and same applies for all members the of demonstrated have given in their speech
as you know is the commission intends soon in to vote with a green on the safety the the energy and the compliance the the objectives the kyoto the the obligations the the european union this is made
to us believe are that two essential aspects different the nature but the same important
the european union the a role favour in the fight against the climate and in the reduction the the emissions can not if first its own objectives and its own obligations addition the accept
the second issue the safety the the energy is a the the keys for the work the the economic development the welfare the our countries that the the european union if whole
the must be entered the the role the the different energy in this green must to role
first the energy
just as a the speakers would i this point want stress which however they added that the not the intention is a certain source the to point or a other to demonise the favour the again a third source
a the the pillars which the compliance the the objectives the kyoto based a the the pillars also the the future energy the the union is the development and the increase the the use the renewable energy
with the document that today for you is the the commission clear to make that we for the in use take the renewable energy the this at not on same facilities have which other energy time the available had as nuclear example coal or oil to few to mention
the support for renewable energy is also justified because the fact that the traditional energy not the significant way contribute the the payment the some external costs the resulting from their use
further can the renewable energy contribute to the work the the energy this we in the european union the available have on a enormous productive
what the tabled amendments the would i you want say that only already their number impressive is which that that the parliament large important importance the this issue
the amendments show also the that there different opinions there on the most adequate way to this type electricity to promote
we are the there however all on agree that the use the this energy in europe must be instruments and although and that this the necessary efforts requires
in our fight for the development the a strong and dynamic green electricity must we in the first place good to other to listen to the other to can learn
i is has that there what this issue the there is the two approaches with opposite positions
from the first approach the the emphasis the the a  force the the forces while from the second approach the need the stressed to the up the periods and active aid
mr the president gentlemen members in its proposal seeks the commission the best the both approaches to retain order a balanced text the to to but i would there not doubt on want let there that the promote the the development the renewable energy now our priority objective is
issues on the market to therefore the the second plan
they have the the a objective the not on the head must be given but they are not the priority objective the the before initiative that mainly is at the the development and the increase the the use the renewable energy
the amendments and emphasise the need to a policy the favour the the green electricity and its many benefits and this amendments can directly by the commission be adopted
same applies for amendment although not for amendment that to technical is for the text the the proposal
in the line the amendment does the i pleased you that to parts that the commission given the important the this issue the possibility at to a new directive for to to on biofuels using from renewable energy from biomass to exactly to are from agricultural this means that a number other problems which we us the see a document easier will be
if we the objectives the the electricity using from renewable energy the there to must we the in the first place agree see to be on the question what we exactly under renewable energy what
the question is the fundamental important to the principles to to the the future market and different speakers are this entered
that like say that we in large lines the definition can continue the the european parliament in amendment proposed if we the however have on the enlargement the the application the the biomass also already is the way which this the proposed perhaps the acceptable than must said that this in not case can apply for waste
waste can usually not if renewable source be as
the commission can nor agree with the proposal with the to peat because peat is doubt a fossil fuel the although in shorter time the but the however a fossil fuel is
as i already said must the biomass nor be abused as in the case the  wood and therefore to we agreement with amendment
as i just already i said is the inadequacy and in fight with the  for fixed waste to all waste without any distinction if renewable source the to apparent
the commission the that part the amendment than also the and the amendments and amendment the this the have
the commission is also the opinion that not only the electricity the for  the used but that all electricity using from renewable energy and the in hybrid reactors the used if green electricity must be regarded
amendment can we than also not accept
in the annex the the proposal are the indicative objectives included with the to the national green  the must be implemented to for the year a total quotas the to to for the european union in its whole accordance the objectives down in the paper the
in this context this i your attention to draw the a two issues
in the first place the important the the fact that the objectives a indicative nature have
gentlemen members i would also the prefer have given the binding objectives but the is matter realistic to are and although the i sorry can i what this point the not agreement to with the proposal the the gentlemen members because this automatically would be rejected by the member
the is the first time that national objectives the this nature the the item be the in a directive
not obligations which must be met but national objectives
course have we this possibility examined but in principle because the consultation with the other party to know the council can i this amendments not accept although i the on positions understand and there very many sympathy for i
therefore would i want stress that article member the essential important is
there must a report be up on the achieve the the relevant objectives and the development the renewable energy in the different countries if from that report that that a the country unless this objectives to role than will the parliament and the council proposals be presented to the situation to correct
course will that objectives are the binding are for the the in issue so he they implemented so he the the way the objectives implemented the objectives are and not obligations
the company which we us plunge with this directive must to are based the transparent measures the the confidence strengthen but they will probably never the the on to if the text the the directive binding objectives contains
a number states like not agree agreement to with the indicative objectives late are with binding objectives
what the calculation the our calculation the in place the the the in was the based the arguments the the have the the credibility
the here sent figures are not from the air matter but based the by us dialogue specific facts
therefore can we not agreement to with the amendments which the favour for legal binding objectives as the up the that committee or the objective the and therefore reject we the this at the amendments and
on the aid must said that this the second group amendments is the regard which the commission the premature felt a harmonised system for to to they has however the declared necessary a proposal the this nature for to to they the the the hand the certain principles
they is the believe that many the the by the parliament tabled amendments the pragmatic approach the the commission strengthen which they same a clearing explanatory a improvement and a supplement forms
therefore support we the amendments and and a number aspects the the amendments and the the have the the idea the the  the the external costs and the compensate the the uncovered external costs the favour the the renewable energy
gentlemen members we can however not agree with the parts which forward the got the the application the rules on aid
nor can we that part the amendment accept which the called that the future harmonised system possibilities the the need to the external costs to  this this because only would can be achieved by means the harmonisation which the scope the the future proposal this would be exceeded
hand can we the agree with the amendments and which hypotheses the that made for large stations only the provided if this companies contribute the the improvement the the environment
in not only another case can support the large stations in the aid for green electricity be included
the large stations are in principle profitable enough and have particularly high environmental
amendment would mean that all renewable energy the competitive are the subsidies and other benefits were excluded reason why the commission this amendment in are current wording not can accept
what the the principles which the future harmonised system must be based can the commission agree with the parts the the amendments and which the the that this regulation account must to the with the ecological objectives the the treaty with the experience the already is gained with other effective has aid and with the geographical circumstances
the commission can other not agreement to with the parts the the amendments and also which forward the got the the in to to regulation or which the called that the market the the biomass not violence the inflicted
to same reason reject we amendment
the commission vote in with the need to institution the the current aid for the  as already is considered in article paragraph d the its proposal
the is they there however particularly vigilant the that the used terms its initiative does let and that this in agreement are with the european electricity
the commission vote in with certain parts the the joint amendments and for far the period the ten year the has the the conservation the the confidence the the investors and not the the continuation the the aid if such
gentlemen members the is indeed matter a climate the confidence to create
as a the members just has said is wind already almost competitive but the is matter that we the development the renewable energy actually continue support
a other member has that out that the support will lead to a greater question to a greater technological development and therefore to a greater competitiveness that is which we confidence
from that point to course time will the islanders gradually the must be integrated and as said is that the second step the first necessary is because that we on sufficient renewable energy have
to above reasons rejected the commission however the amendments and
what the the amendments with the to the forces the competition can the commission agreement to with the relevant parts the the amendments and and with amendment which the need the stressed to a ecological electricity in the life to to the commission rejected other amendment which harmonisation the the national aid the called
we must on a broad definition the the understanding system to have and therefore can we the amendments and not accept
on the technical measures and the guarantee the origin the the ecological electricity can we unfortunately not agreement to with the amendments the that at are this guarantee to to know the all types electricity or the electricity from from third countries this this because would the outside the scope the the proposal
rejected be the amendments and and amendment which the aim rules in to to for the crossborder trade in  we find that premature in this stage and we can this now not agree
nor can we amendment accept that the proposal would weaken because the the member compulsory to revision the the regulatory framework also amendment point we the
same applies for the amendments and and the binding rules want up for the more the the grid and other costs the the network the european scale
what the the amendments and can the commission agreement to with the proposal that to course time the national objectives on green electricity be the for the period but they the the parts the the amendments the which forward the got the the application the the rules the the competition the the area the aid
gentlemen members the sorry i that my speech is like but i am the opinion that this debate the attention more than worth is
i would the rapporteur mrs been again congratulate want wish and i would all gentlemen members congratulate want wish with their work which i would want insist the the absolute need to now final a decisive impetus to give the the use the renewable energy in the european union
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
role the women in the peaceful consultations
the the item is the report a the mrs theorin behalf the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities on the role the women in the peaceful consultations ini
mr the president since the end the the cold war has the lunacy the moved to the villages streets and homes
conflicts the earlier in than between the countries
war and conflicts are always  been but the most victims the under the citizens
women and girls be exposed the certain forms the violence
they be there mention and if  used
the was must without aid their children suitable and elderly speaking
however take women not part the the peace and their needs and priorities be ignored
in the commission for the reconstruction the tajikistan where widows live was only the the members women
the the first peace to a end to make the the conflict in burundi were the the participants women
there took not few rugova women part the the peace the a point to behind the war in bosnia while the whole world the the informed was the the systematic rapes the women and the responsibility the they had take to the society again the to build
the the negotiations the holding the the bombing the the nato the kosovo four year later was only one women in the delegation
the the creation the the pact for the reconstruction the europe were women all not mentioned despite their unique experience with the strengthen the peace from the basis
still less were they represented in the committee that responsible was for the reconstruction
you can a house only the a solid foundation build
if we the the population ostracism to we not sustainable peace
women must fully participate the all peace reconstruction and missions
while formal assistance almost only a  are let international experience and statements see how important the participation the women is the conflict and the strengthening the the peace
in the few cases which citizens and women have part the formal peace has that success has as in south guatemala and cambodia
this that also from a series  as from the resolution on women peace and safety the the security two weeks ago has adopted
the civil refugees and asylum must protected be there must a end to the the impunity for rapes in th and the active participation the women the conflict and strengthening the the peace the all levels must encouraged be
this is my report that a broad support in the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities has been to the group in the to to for the resolution to vote am i agreement has with amendment with the to paragraph where both the group if the group behind are
i i a supplement for the the fourth protocol the geneva so rape forced exalted and sexual slavery just as if war be regarded if terrorism and torture
i call the member the to the treaty the rome on a permanent international criminal to ratify
a such court is need to the trend to break the the systematically use the rape if breaking
further must the whole force men both if women  to be on the equality between men and women
that applies with particularly for the vicious
the objective must least women in all peace and reconstruction are
local participation the peace and  is important
therefore call i the member and the commission the to individual organisations for prevention and  the technical financial and political area to support
although the share women limited is point studies from that the participation the women the  the relationship with the local population and the general standards improves
the presence the men in tragedy lead other to a increase the sexual violence and prostitution the the 
accessories also from the eu are back after accusations the sexual violence in forces and mozambique
peace is a many to heavy burden for only one body one government or one minorities
sustainable peace is not to the if the the half humanity ignores
peace can only achieved be if women fully participate the the peace
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen ladies and gentlemen i like mrs theorin the rapporteur thank because they this issue the role the women in the peaceful consultations in a report the the european parliament has dealt
women be often been affected by wars and disquieting because they responsible are for their family for children and elderly but also because they often the absence the their men and fathers the responsibility only must to and therefore also only for the survive the the family must ensure
their situation is however also as difficult because women still always must fight for recognition and for participation the right level
decisions on the out and organise the aid the under the responsibility the  and the show little interest and respect for the knowledge the affairs and the  the women
while the however as for the hand is to in such difficult situations precisely those in to to the the ground were the the home the responsibility have and to the consultations use to make the their experience
but because this unfortunately not course is the in this report very specific called that women involved be the the different bodies that they that must work
the report  the fact that there in conflict always again violence and also appalling sexual violence the used
this must be prevent example by women in camps special protection to offer by the camps the a certain way in to parts
women the the victims are been the violence must be help
the that point are we the agree
but this aspect the violence against women the conflicts is fact outside the subject the this report the is a as topical and important issue that there fact a separately report the devoted would must be
the  is the what this affects to outside the details and repeat we if group ask therefore this part in the form the a officially document to deal
we must there also for ensure that the demands within a framework the that also actually can be fulfilled
as hope i that the found compromise mrs theorin has this in the with paragraph already the out also the support the the plenary sitting the
this where decisions under the competence the the member the can we if european parliament changes and desired improvements to the to
impose can we they however not
the member must the own responsibility decisions take also for women in camps
the may clear are that this a very wellconstructed report is the group has the itself not easy made the the submit the the relevant amendments and i question the gentlemen colleagues to their support also for the by the rapporteur tabled amendment the paragraph
if we international respond want find than must we this things the diplomatic way and with the necessary  the there to and encourage
mr the president the issue women in relationship to the problem the war and peace has to free recent in international any only nonarable attention been
often was this subject abused if political  between conflict parties
the the running taken derailed the the un since was this also clear the case with particularly with the conflict in the east
because the issue the women and peace itself little political weight had could also utopian favour the debate dominate
since the conference the beijing is this considerably changed
this is the first the to a adult treatment the this issue given
in the years partly is there with particularly in and the the un and its related organisations many in the the
the was therefore time that this also in level form the was given and as the more the issues the women is the in europe what end dragging
the significance the some men in this house against a serious treatment the this subject she have distribution is a sign the the mandatory
obviously want they their power in affairs the foreign policy and defence for itself the and find they that  the by men can be strongly
mr theorin deserves tribute for the perseverance which they that subject against the  has held
the october has the security after a  debate a resolution entitled   and  adopted
mrs theorin mentioned that already
a resolution the terms thrust in large lines seems the what now for us is
also that is a indication for the important the the matter
finally mr the president like i my disappointment express on the for i perversely too the have led to the weaken the paragraph on the rights and the free choice the women the the victims were the rape and 
for i is there on this rights not to 
political about can i the before amendment earlier interpret if a tactical defeat or a tactical number than if a content compromise and that would fact the  worthy must are
mr the president just if the other speakers like also i the rapporteur congratulate with the comprehensive and good report the contains a number proposals the if essential would must must for everyone the somewhere the world the decisionmaking does
the problem with a such report is however that the the many proposals not priorities much
i give to that this also not the intention was
the risk that we after the vote simply continue with the next issue is than also very large
i i for that we the next step priority to and that we start after to think what we effective can do to this proposal to concrete especially in the framework the the civil and military  the the eu the last months preparing
i request the council the mr solana and the commission more the commissioner patten the many ideas in the report to consider and if inspiration to use for the work the now the the the are but which we specific carry little know
the is a good opportunity to in the practice to looking what the concepts equal treatment mainstreaming hymn the the women etc fact mean
late us start with few specific initiatives
then must the council and the commission in the parliament to tell what there possible is
there are few for the hand present things example the training the police or military the insight that rape a offence is that we not can accept nor if torture
the would training can give for a greater involvement the ngos the construction the facilities for people in crisis etc
then would on this issues hearings seminars and such organised can be
this would the whole process and the creating the this preventive actions transparent make
if this the result would are the our intention the role the women to strengthen than will the eu the this area perhaps total reiteration a human face have been
mr the president i like first say that i large important importance the this report that without more excellent is
but now must we to the practice move i like than also like something say on two topical issues
from the perspective the the  women are because the  in the story must women future a role play in the peace
i join i therefore the the the delegation the ten members the to the east is travelled two weeks ago mrs morgantini can you there more on tell to to achieve that women not only participate the the peace but also that there a european policy is and that we women a european policy support that is at the peace in the east
we must us therefore pragmatic up
the second point the not the role the women the the peace but the role the women if 
on two weeks the by nongovernmental organisations in fetching a tribunal organised
the will in december and i request the parliament this to support this  be taken to the the denounce to to what the  during the second war have human
this is the large important since the the is to a forwardlooking tribunal that for the first crimes against the humanity deals the at are against women
this  for the majority korean women are during the second war there misled and to  made by japan that this crime not like recognise
this women were imprisoned taken
in the followup the there the this tribunal a film with taken large
mrs theorin i would like see that we behalf the commission rights the the women the initiative would take this action to support with the view the recognition and feira the this against women specific crime against the humanity
mr the president mrs the commissioner the is necessary that women a role play in the peaceful regulation the conflicts because this unfortunately the large influence are the their life and because women usually not active the the conflicts participate
the most refugees are women and children
in the case the armed conflicts be women often duplication affected this they are exposed the rapes and the other forms the sexual abuse the in some cases if warfare are used
the problems which the women in issue to to are be still aggravated because they then be  by the community which they from are
has is however that women a particularly positive role can play in the peaceful regulation the conflicts and in the organisation in camps
we are the agree agree that rapes forced exalted forced  and all other forms the sexual violence be recognised if crime against the humanity the texts must than also be adapted to women the effective way to protect
also must there financial resources available to be the to women to help the the victims are become the such arrangement
if the women a role was allocated in the peaceful regulation the conflicts and the initiatives for the reconstruction would this the achieve the such objectives a document facilitate
the would also the general hymn the men the good to
the before report that we because the content on the this issue the important consider lapses however too in repeat and contains a number points the us not unhappy we recognise however that the to a real problem is that must be resolved and therefore will our group this report support
mr the president mrs the commissioner the the war and the the refugees on the whole world is from from the  population in the particularly women and children
if the however is to the participation the women in decisionmaking the the prevention and solution the armed conflicts and if the is to initiatives see we that their share minimum is
there must a end the this situation to because there in many cases not account the taken with the rights priorities and interests the women in peace also that that the few women the the the decisionmaking the this area have part a very good example forms
i mention only two examples to this to illustrate mary  fact person in the humanitarian aid the the united nations they has its task with enormous many courage and inertia fulfilled by unsafe hellish to visits by unacceptable situations the the denounce to to by pressure from to exercise the countries and international organisations to the not in a complicity silence to improving but the necessary measures to take
a another example is from portugal where the diplomatic service only since the revolution the april accessible is for women with ana gomes our  in indonesia has portugal recently in the matter east the the whole world and the the european parliament in the particularly let see what role a women can play the before the the problems and the suffering the a people that already year long a s the
the is high time that women a share to in the solve the this type problems
this must the a reasonable and vigorous way to done so in the future the political responsible will aware that war everyone affects and not only men women are because those the the most to suffering have and precisely therefore must they represented are in all bodies the the armed conflicts involved are
this especially to conflict to prevent and as possible to prevent that there war allows but in any case to such situations to to and to the the innocent victims the the most affected be women and children their dignity back to give
this are few reasons why we for this very important report will vote
mr the president i thank mrs theorin for its special report and for its proposals
i am if  and  together with other women active in the establishment the relations and the build the bridges in conflict in the report i i the valuable experience repugnant the women the last years the operations have gained
peace is not only but absence the war but also recognition the economic and social justice
the is where that we women in the zones the most affected be but we are not only victims we are also  the alternatives for war and violence and  the change
the international network the the women in the black against war and violence is of a example in israel protest this women already twelve year against the military occupation the palestine they to a dialogue with the palestinian women and to the solidarity with them the
we women members have that can see when we in this tragic days the ground were
and during the war in the former yugoslavia have the women in the black from belgrade links was with the croatian and rugova women
and in different countries are we the borders have united in the rejection the the national restrictions
this work and this knowledge the the women the diplomacy the the basis the a alternative for the diplomacy the the countries can are should not longer be ignored they must our the the places where the decisions be taken and the all diplomatic levels
therefore is the fundamental that women present are the negotiations prevention management
speaker the by the president cut
president there is already many said and i i not in repeat the
i would mrs theorin congratulate want wish because they the the european level a problem has raised that we rarely discussed have
 i the different comments than think i that those the say that the good would are if we our priorities agree look and therefore the number points that we want achieve also something to right have
there the very many in the report and not everything will moment done can be
i give for what i itself the a few priorities
the first is that we all member to must encourage the treaty the rome to ratify
particularly little member have this to now to done the says i that the there two or three are
therefore if we this already would can do than was that a first step
in this treaty the recognised that rape during wars and all consequences that given must be if a 
that sounds today perhaps normal but the was to for very briefly absolutely not normal and not course
a second point there is the october in the security a resolution approved resolution the  for   or  in  and  
therefore that was in the security the the united nations
i think that the good would are since the this approved is that also the european union agree would look what points this asked were because they are accepted in the un and they must therefore also the european level accepted can be
there be a  points asked and that are there very what
again congratulate and let we hope that there something the is
mr the president mrs the commissioner i like first mrs theorin the i congratulate with the fact that they the initiative has taken to the drafting the this excellent report on a such important but also very topical issue the to we namely the question how with a real participation the women the the negotiations on  the world can be changed and the now still changes culture the confrontation and fields can be into in a culture the peace dialogue and democratic 
a such change is the certainly possible not only because women by the history across always already linked are been with nonviolence but also because women war and conflicts otherwise perceived than men very the life the the women the because in the sign the the protection the the life the dialogue reconciliation and negotiations
this peaceful values the the women can a alternative are they can the foundations are for a new civilisation for a civilisation the peace and dialogue the what level than also and the eradication the war and violence if instruments for consultations
i am that convinced that if the women the palestinian and israeli women a voice in the  had had and involved were been the the peace there highest probably long a fair and sustainable solution was found for the palestinian issue and we now not again a crisis had had this crisis is the result the not less than seven year failed negotiations
i i also together with others a visit the the iraq
with that visit wanted we the tangible way expression give the us opposition against the embargo i can you assure that women never and to never arbitrary political and military objectives over lives would places and never and to never innocent children per month would obstruct the the altar the arbitrary political economic or strategic interests in this area
therefore must in the future the the drafting the the policies the the european union also account be taken with this dimension
president commissioner colleagues i like i in the first place with the the many recurs and congratulate the other colleagues but in the particularly also the the words the therefore swiebel in the with the report the maj maj theorin on the role the women in the peaceful consultations
the is a enlightening report built with many expertise wellconstructed and honest what the some even  will happened but which the the truth said the
therefore support i the almost original full report and find we that the most amendments the our colleagues  and sometimes even downright hypocritical are
mr theorin has a  report written and we hope that the aid the centres for age not removed the amendment c
the greens to not agreement with the text the our colleagues made have in the with amendment
congratulate mrs theorin for your certainly and your determination
mr the president the report the mrs theorin is what i the a very end in the demand the social terms the women
with a precise choice be violations the the dignity the women support and be consequences called in the sense the changes
in the report the the social exclusion the women not only if a the itself separate problem as but rightly the also stressed that protection against crime and personal safety not more only within the borders the a country can be guaranteed
therefore support i the demands from this report the to that women right must to the diplomatic influence
i support the initiative in this report as the the mentioned the that sexual  women protection the the community need have and that the perpetrators not more who should to
women and men are different any human is otherwise
for really equal opportunities is a other treatment requires what that is that make the people always still itself from
mr the president the report the mrs theorin contains all unfortunate and peculiar parts i must say that we the idea the armies if a type social service with political standardised if  principle better can avoid
i like briefly one paragraph the the resolution discuss namely paragraph the the the use the socalled soldiers condemned
unfortunately be the terms not defined and the there not distinction made
we condemn all the cruelty kidnapping the children some still not ten year old in the particularly in certain african countries as sierra leone or uganda were they be trained to who and participate the barbaric practices if  and mutilation
that are not military and they must be reform the young people in our own armies
the problem is that some groups the discussions on soldiers opportunity to reputable institutions if the british army to criticise that is recently happened
in principle try we to prevent that young people to zones be sent sometimes happening that but than must they with proud and in  units
we must prevent that such practises work that encouraged would must be the confused with the barbaric practices the the author the this report doubt the the view has
mr the president i wish mrs theorin congratulate with this excellent report and i think that we if women us this extremely fortunately should prices because we directly or indirectly benefit will have the the valuable and innovative proposals and contribute the this report
mr the president with the before report the a in the european policy still  way path namely the the the contribution the the women the the peace
a way the to my believe many the opportunities offers and the possible change would can to in the sad dazzle the failures the the only  rule already centuries has has
although the men the this area the relief way fail have with women here still always the a wall the opposition and exclusion
the report is good documented indepth and precise the the demonstrated the the ability to principles as clear to formulate if the done in article with certainly but also with a large practical insight while also the most necessary requirements be the
what unfortunately mr the president that the the reasons the the consensus the quality has must out
my only comfort is the idea that the consensus the on what parliamentary abilities mrs theorin has
the is a shame that the council here not represented is
mr the president please you as kind i to say by who the council the the at the represented or by who the high representative the the european foreign and security the represented
the new european foreign and security must not cannot the the proposal the the parliament or the the like the the european women the the this policy want participate
i request you us protest on to to the the council
the council practised a serious mistake by not the this debate present to are
mr the president normally start the speeches with a  for the good out work
in my case is that impossible because i think that the  not adopted must be
i think also that the rapporteur in the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities the the dangerous ice even if they that that there a broad support is for a report that with eight vote for and five vote against is adopted
the is a insult the the parliament to a report to use to issues to the to to the outside the integrate the
mrs theorin would a report write on the role the women in the peaceful consultations
but now deals they everything the the situation the women in camps to how women force develop
in its fighting to already the injustice to combat far they against systematic rapes and sexual slavery
itself condemn i all rapes and all slavery
there are points in the report the possible belong in a report that we seriously would can discuss with all committees which we also interested the the foreign policy and defence involved can involve as the issue on the part 
mrs theorin has long time struggle against the accession the sweden to the union
now like they suddenly that the eu rules what officials our ministries the foreign affairs must appointed
that is consistency
we must there other for ensure that by means the conflict the conditions for peace the all levels with all operators improves and not continue to in 
i am totally against a collective charges the one minorities what here evening is happened
i think the a insult for all men the their life have given for the defence the the peace freedom and democracy in their own country or the operations
contradictions between the gender create what evening is happened is to my opinion peaceful or constructive
therefore am i and many with i the plan to tomorrow against this report to vote
i can the namely not seriously take
mr the president i i is this indeed a very innovative report a very innovative resolution which the specific way a very new dimension the given the the exercise the the foreign policy
no can say that women better generals or better negotiators would are
no can say that women democratic or  are
from the resolution that however the very clear that time when the political a crisis must manage time when the political armed conflicts and the social consequences the war must manage a very important part the the society there the other gender
women take other social experience in their navigate that
women are not people with more or less expertise women are people with other experience experience the however essential are in the exercise the the political and with particularly in the management
in the report the this situation with interesting and sometimes even shocking data from the before done
i am the however the with a number years agree that we very specific objectives and measures need have so mainstreaming clear and specific are up can find in the policies the programme programmes and the different actions
if you the good take will i briefly like the few fundamental recommendations the the resolution which the commission to action the asked the first the recommended under both sexes a policies the the to to on peace and  and on the rapid reaction facility
this is however already part the the regulation the the december the adopted in this regulation the clear said that when the to the safety and stability the particular side the the borders the the european union is account must be taken with the physical integrity the women and men where this also may be threatened
my second comment is on the regulations on human
in this regulations the for in a basis for our political actions with the to third countries the is the to by the union out actions measures the prevent the armed conflicts the respond the the consequences the armed conflicts the possibility the confidencebuilding measures the promotion the the humanitarian right and the support the international and local organisations the the deal with the prevent the conflicts
in all projects the by the european commission be financed is taken for mainstreaming
i mention you the example the angola last year have we money given to also women organisations to let participate the the efforts to the  the the crisis
the third mention i the participation the the european community the the concerning the victims the torture
a the our objectives is special concern to to the the needs the women
last year had we of a first example when initiatives were undertaken for medical psychological and social aid the displaced women in bosnia
the fourth element is the important role the women play in the peace in the balkans and the mediterranean which the european community support has given
the fifth mention i the role the echo the the bureau for humanitarian aid the the european commission the parliament has the commission challenged and invited the account to the with mainstreaming
i must the been that in the programme programmes the echo normally account the taken with mainstreaming and that also a attempt the done mainstreaming to processing in many by echo financed but by other organisations out programme programmes as the high commissioner the the united nations the international federation the the red cross and other organisations
the last years are specific actions the implement the for the protection the health and the social position the women a important part the the programme programmes is for them for
i like to finally still something say on the european fund
in article member the that what the conditions for reception and access to the asylum the special measures can be affected for particularly vulnerable people as women
since this programme also in the resolution the mentioned must i been that this measures by the member be affected
the commission can the own initiative the the resources spend and they paying this the special actions as training the officials the in the centres work the police and  so the the special needs the women refugees meet can be has
as also in the resolution the the also the this measures in the framework the the european fund so possible account taken with mainstreaming
mr the president we see that in this time for the first mainstreaming other participation the women perhaps not directly the rule the but in any case regular start the to crop in the programme programmes
course enough this not
this is however the a beginning and i am that convinced that we with political actions and initiatives as the before resolution and with specific objectives the the the which also the parliament and the commission must participate the situation can change
you thank mrs the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
before we further to with the agenda like i two comments make
mr izquierdo has the there just on full that there no the the council present is
gentlemen mr the  is the council never present
the problem follows partially continue from the fact that we the the the the the agenda important issues to the evening refer
that is the responsibility the the conference the presidents and who that like change must ensure ensure that a debate on renewable energy or on important so not the this time place because as said is the council the this time never present
if you i a personal comment allow i believe that we how there also on the contribution the the only here present man thought must be many further would to if more men the this type debates would participate
normal the domestic work
the the item is the report a the mrs smet behalf the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities on the normal the domestic work in the informal economy ini
president we fall the to a more  problem namely the  the domestic work that the done by third in private families because this is the on
the problem is that millions people especially women this work out that there also very large question to is but that there not few  the this work there
from the its data the there to find are that that the to a very comprehensive sector is
i i therefore try after to to in different countries but also the european level how people for far the this can look because the is often to work course in this sector work
that are there many millions
i i the european level vain sought to a comprehensive study the us a insight would can give in the extent the the sector the problems the in the sector there the regulations how incomplete also the in the european countries there the pilot the there there the  the there left and right than however the the on to but i must say that there within the european commission nothing to find was
hence my first suggestion the the commission give the task a research to out encouraged the financial resources this as you this financial resources for need you from example the resources for  because the is however mainly on women or from the resources for  because the are often poor women the this work out
therefore i think that the both resources in eligible to to agree a comprehensive study to the problem to do and to look what the in certain countries trying the the on to to
that is therefore a first specific question
than come i the a second point if the the sector like regulate than must course a number points investigated be
the first aspect is the the other to the question and supply
not only the the question to administrative aid to and  the supply the 
who would because in the sector want work if you know that the in the black must done without social security etc etc
addition is there not few place where question and supply other can meet
therefore that is a first aspect
a second aspect is that the costs for the user that like say the private family that a  if the the regular market the the constituency market not present higher should are than the price the the the black market there because otherwise remains the work course the rule
a third aspect is that the benefit for the worker for the administrative aid therefore better must are than the current 
fourth aspect there must investigated be what social statute this granted can be
finally this everything will necessarily a financial intervene the the authorities content or tax or  because a private family can a fully statute even already is this limited not pay and than continue they all the the black market
i think that the matter is through the  as that already asked is in the opinion the the european parliament on this guidelines the member to the to to the sector to regulate
my question is therefore the the commission in what is the commission a effort do to the  in the future the to apply least this where the is to services also to this service to refer and the member to questions in be a beginning the solution to seek
than come i the a last point the native that is course a very specific problem
many native are here illegal to with a  and to to the three months back example to the countries to that visa to let entailed and meantime are they here quasiprovocative in a housekeeping
in a number cases be they exploited and abused
they have not aid
they have failed if they the to someone use that their illegal situation know will be
hence that this absolutely special attention spent must be
i i the over weeks had that there many interest there both from international  if from a number national euroworks
the dutch are the i been the belgians are the i been the italians also the this problem
i would therefore the commission want economic to least a beginning to make with the seek to a solution
mr the president mrs the commissioner domestic work is the oldest form the work the the women by the centuries across has done
a form the work the or in economic or in social sense is recognised or the gentlemen estimated
now makes this work part from the what we the informal economy mention and the has negative consequences for both those the this work out if for the accounts the the states
the is however to work with flexible times which the particularly suitable is life and appeal to combine
by changes in the family the the domestic work a still important place in the the market and therefore is the the fundamental important that this work clear the defined and that there research the done to are real extent
the is a activity the the full must be recognised and the would must be included in the directives on the employment order the social rights the the workers to regulate
the situation the this area some large differences between the countries the the union and must the rules to be bound
the workers for the majority women would easier a training must can follow
immigrants make a important part from the those the in this sector working are what special measures requires as specialised centres which the necessary aid can be provided
this report is particularly the this the provides in a growing need the the market
mrs smet has a excellent work made that course our support has
mr the president say behalf my group like i mrs smet praise my for its initiative to the up the this report
the is here in fact to the break the a political were
because if you take that domestic work recognised must be if a full appeal and mrs smet says that and i say the its after than met you in first body  and 
i will few the the  the encompasses let through
 one is the domestic work the under the 
is the the to measure in the 
answer yes but than must there the a european definition to and must the countries the authorities more efforts out to the black work over table to to
 two are you than for the 
answer no
who this asking confused two things
the is here to the administrative services the paid by third in the housekeeping the done
in the dutch speak we the the  in belgium the the  sometimes also the the 
how pleasing
 three
the work the the  regulate is however work white make and than the the however many to duration
answer now have we more  core to tackle
the domestic work the done by a category with the  opportunities the the market
women with not and outdated training etc etc
they are appropriate the this work in the housekeeping with process working and not few form the legal and social protection
this form the exploitation take place because the employers that are therefore the families where the administrative aides for work the lack the legislation their hands in innocence can any
now there however by social changes a increasing question to the administrative services will to the the time the relationship between the administrative  the employers and the authorities to review
how that exactly will must asking still many study and consultation
but in any case must there a legal and social embedded the this  to the recognition and social security for the involved will and qualitative improvement the that work itself
that will also for the employers better are and therefore must the them a proportional contribution in the costs be expect
mr the president mr the commissioner to to start like i the rapporteur thank
i like the that domestic work important is
the must respected and fullyfledged be
therefore are we liberals behind the most conclusions the the report
we will however against the report if whole vote because the subsidiarity
this is namely a issue for the member
some proposals are to detailed
the next points must the member however in eight to take there must attention to for the double  the women
domestic work is often been there are many vacancies the wages are to low there the still more black work and often are the women with particularly native the exploited be
many the them the outside the net the the social security
a social europe must that ensure that the member ensure ensure that this native often from from the countries reasonable working have
a wider look what the domestic work is for many a good way to the market under more for young and immigrants
constituency  are today the day often to duration because there vat and contributions must be 
there must experiments with fund be done and the system must simplified be
the must easier are to a company in administrative services to launch and to to
in my country sweden hear you often two important arguments against the promote the paid domestic work
the first would the the equality between men and women prevent
that is not where
the makes the situation for many families easier and that increase precisely the equality
many women can career make and work if they aid to the practical work the would i nothing surprised if that also the case is for a number women in this sitting
the second argument is that there a  the the market would the
also not where
all people the now black work to than because a jobs with good social conditions
there are therefore both economic if moral reasons the to to for the intentions the the report but the is a issue the the national level and not the eu must be resolved
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen colleagues the report on the normal the domestic work the rapporteur smet is very interesting but calls the i joint feelings the
the is doubt necessary to work in different sectors the the society the to tackle with particularly in the administrative services
the the also time to domestic work more status to give and the to recognise if a full appeal
the is also the important to that to to see that native not exploited be by to low wages the lack the social security and pure oppression
but the the a wrong signal the to as in the report the proposed to demands that the member by a directive or other legislation both prices must adapt if fund must introduce for administrative services
that the to far and also is the the wrong way
the is in contradiction with the willingness to domestic work to see if a full appeal
because why would the  the the without the deductible the the tax must are but the collection the the still not
administrative services reform the other services is something very otherwise than the increase the the status the domestic work
to finally like i still say that i in this report a reference wrong to the fact that we in the near future many need will have the the work the our immigrants to offer have
mr the president mrs the commissioner used could almost only the better  households the a administrative aid afford but now are the working men and women but especially also single mothers and older people for who a administrative aid necessary and essential is
the need is in the last years exponentially grown a fact that however hardly are impact has found in the regular work and the the linked rights and duties
but where and how must this work be classified
there is need the a legal that domestic work that under the most different designations the done if full appeal in all member recognises and that rules the the area the law 
the appeal administrative aid must in very europe together with the social partners be described and must this where this still not is happened be included in the guidelines
the definition the domestic work is without more a problem
where am you the borders the the diversity the this work
the domestic work only up or only cook only for the children ensure or only 
fact is that there thousands women are the years this work out without social protection to enjoy and a pension the to build
the is where that both  if workers often satisfied are with this situation because the as cheaper is
information and macroeconomic as this in few countries already there must be extended and improve to impetus to give so the now existing  can be down
in austria with particularly in the region where i from come the since three year a by the eu subsidised project which a consultancy for women very successful intervene if mediator for administrative aides
many women have the this way a fixed the been
also is the already occasions been that two or three families if result the this project joint a administrative aid in service have taken
the is is that any nonconducive the timelimits and end is the to the quantitative if the the  the administrative aides
accordance the communication is the the to two fundamental issues
the first must the statistical data up on this phenomenon and they analyse
as mrs smet because already said there such data currently not or in the european union or in many member where this phenomenon usually not the registered the second must we see how we this problem can into in the general strategy
with other words the black working women must be included in the legal economy this is a combination the specific policies need as sanctions in case the exploitation campaigns the each level on the benefits the footing the this workers and the third a unceasing effort to harmonisation and modernisation the the legislation
there is still very little experience the this area and only very little member have the special been with the problems the domestic work
i can now difficult promise that we this problem will tackle in the guidelines for the employment for i must you however the mention that in the guidelines for the year for the first clear the referred to work
we are the plan to work the the hand the the findings to now to and to ensure for both statistics on if studies to this problem in a second debate this can we than look what next step we the european level can to
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to at closed

the european parliament is the that aware that after ten year the conflict in yugoslavia not achieve with hands can be down in any case not immediately and that there priorities the must be
the balkans where your country also to one is the because the the line between large civilisations and large religions the but already to often the tragic way us joint past if europeans have the

very loud applause
mrs the president gentlemen ladies and gentlemen is there a political institution where we as openly and sincerely on the important wish and the political aspirations the a small european people can speak if the european parliament
europe must welcome are with as such directly by the citizens elected people although we the far on a small number countries have
the is i a large pleased also already is the but in a short speech if this to as such forum the internal problems for to should to the a country that a heavy storms has must coping to end a coast the peace and freedom the the horizon to see forestall
the federal republic yugoslavia can the during this period the political restoration and social development not better beacon wish than the european union
the there not doubt that there still the necessary time thorough will to for us country actually to this pay transnational institution will can join
since the decisive political genuinely the september or the still more decisive power the october is the foreign policy the yugoslavia however at the a comprehensive rapprochement to the family the countries the together the european union forms and the final participation the
if the humanity ever violence war and rule if resources the protection the national interests behind the like let can they look to the experience the the european union the a was example is for not only the european countries the still must join but the whole world
by the training the this community the national states has the european union prospects for a new age for the humanity opened
i am than not much on the reached results if the on the way which this results are achieved
the to the vitality the the european civilisation in world historic the and also the political performance and imaginative the regard the future developments clear to the
the beginning the the new century was together with the invention the a new political forum the national the which europe the kind  behind the additional also has europe in this  time a higher political form invented a transnational community which the challenges the the globalisation meet can be into
the model the the european union is a double challenge for yugoslavia if 
the first give we the prefer the a  form the economic cultural and political integration within europe this is continue from the fact that we in the during the the recent history with different  the large powers were faced
if we the second end for accession to the european union in eligible want to must we ensure ensure that the gradual approach which the western countries the the level the the integration have elected if model fact for the preparatory the the balkans
we are us that aware that not the the scale the own force to the european union will can join the is therefore clear that we good relations with our neighbouring free trade and collective  must the to build
we are that convinced that the european union such developments in europe will support and will help the serious shortcomings the the countries to overcome under other by means the the pact for europe
because we decisive are us within europe to develop want we the agreement with the european union as soon possible sign the provisions the this agreement want we use if principle for us political and economic restoration and for the subsequent developments the way to the european integration
we are that aware that we if people and if the many the our political and economic habits and institutions will must change to the intended objective to achieve
we must not only democratic institutions the to to a task which we already are started but must there also for ensure that this institutions by and by democratic are what perhaps more being in earth will have
we must not only move to privatisation the our centralised economy but must also a system up for the protection the the free trade and the whole economic process
we must to to a internal system the freedom and peace and this then match the the rules and habits the in the european community and the european union already decades years recognised are
while we work the the confidence the our citizens in our institutional must we also their confidence see to give for the european institutions the in the small fifty year the their there their citizens sustainable peace and prosperity have the
the democratic changes the since october in yugoslavia place have the international political level surprising quickly to upheaval results led
yugoslavia has again are place welcome in the united nations and the organisation for safety and cooperation in europe yugoslavia is member become the the pact for europe and the procedure for accession to the council the europe is in the is the
our most task is now to ensure for democratic internal relations within the federal republic yugoslavia
kosovo is without more our the concern
the there not doubt that the status the kosovo a issue the democracy is
resolution the the security offers us opportunities to the up the many important humanitarian and democratic processes
we have the aid and support the europe need to as quickly possible the refugees from kosovo to can repatriate accordance the spirit the the best democratic tradition
course have we many aid need the the again effort make the the destroyed homes so the refugees a home have to to back to times
we do a appeal the europe to us the speedy way to help a safe and economic responsible climate to create so the refugees the feeling to that they without risk to their homes can return
i believe that europe the force and the like has to us to help giving to give the the right the any human to in are own house to live
also have we the support the europe need the the the and solve the the huge ecological problems the result the the bombing the yugoslavia which depleted uranium is used
we are ready for a open dialogue with albanian groups on safety political and humanitarian issues and all other important points the to a democratic solution the the  problem in kosovo can lead
what the relations between serbia and montenegro within the federal the the was the former  structure the the federal republic yugoslavia a serious threat for the function the the the
the first step in the direction the a constitutional restructuring the the federal the is the up the a framework for a as broad possible democratic dialogue on the relations between the two republics
we will many patience and wisdom need have the the debates in the republican and the federal antiamerican the the broad social discussion and the  the to must lead that the federal republic yugoslavia the into to a good functioning prosperous rule the the interests the the citizens the i the and full equality the the national traditions the montenegro and serbia can guarantee
the is the important that to point that there large numbers muslims and albanians in serbia and montenegro live
there is not few good reason to them a role the the integration in yugoslavia to deny
in a democratic federal the can muslims and albanians in montenegro and serbia in one country coexistence and can we together the our federal the build
we can not without the support the europe the the seek to solutions by means the open brilliantly and according democratic procedures free the pressure and ultimatums
we would however like the opportunity to europe to proof that we the basis the purely democratic principles itself in the are the constitutional equality the serbia and montenegro within yugoslavia form to give
developments and regional selfgovernment within yugoslavia have our special attention
we are us that aware that this the core the each democratic system is and we are are with a careful analysis the the experience the europe and ourselves have gained the the area the regional selfgovernment
there is many about on the worrying the which the yugoslav economy state
the humanitarian aid the us country is the invaluable gentlemen but we hope that there european investment programmes for in the place to the the us possible make a there for ourselves the to build
given this huge problems is the clear that we still a long way to to have for we can join to europe which serbia and montenegro used a dignified place 
however the the that our opportunities now essential greater are than only half month ago
perhaps understand the citizens the the european union that still the best if they back in their own history and think the the years after the second war when the perspectives for europe and the european civilisation extremely uncertain were
your courageous predecessors are when the a insecure company started the important results has effective
you the members the the european parliament the direct representatives the the citizens the the european member will if not another understand why the possibility to to europe to to act particularly uncertain is for us citizens the the current federal republic yugoslavia
therefore address i i if the first democratic elected president the yugoslavia not much to you because the needed support the the reconstruction the the country but rather for your support and understanding for the situation which us people and us country situation
approval the the minutes the the previous sitting
we resume the sitting
i must you just say that there somewhere in the building a interference in the system is
the people the the system have sit are already only time are to from to seek where the problem the is
the seems still again the to crop
i hope that the as quickly possible the resolved
the minutes the the sitting the yesterday are distributed
not any
mr the president the page the the annex the the minutes the the that i a voice i issued the favour the amendment the the 
i am the not agree with the thrust the that amendment and i would than also like see that the down that i against this amendment i voted
that will in the next minutes be corrected mr watson
mr the president behalf mrs the the laan and myself like i like let set that we against amendment the the  have voted
we would like see that the down that we have voted for the release the leyla zana and the other kurdish prisoners
mr the president perhaps is the useful if i with the to this subject a appeal the the rules i
yesterday speaking my group as the so votes in this parliament the the automatic pilot to to the discovery to to that some the us a serious  had committed the the vote on amendment that was tabled by the gue and  to release the mrs zana and others
we proving per wrong against to have voted
i i a and another already let correct but i like you like formally ask to today the possibility in to clause for colleagues from the group to contact the to take with the 
some are there now not partly because the adjournment and partly because this matter not was for
i would your aid in be the price to
the minutes be approved
mr the president i i a comment on something that more to make has with what to is than with what is been i like namely confirmed to that the vote on bse today during the vote day the taken
there is because there the a for the citizens very important and interesting matter and the would good are if we on today day a decision can take
the parliament importance are approval the this request
access the the public to documents the the european parliament the council and the commission
the the item is the report a the the mr cashman behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the proposal for a regulation the the european parliament and the council on access the the public to documents the the european parliament the council and the commission com c cod
i i the honour this report to present on a subject that the essential important is for the lives the the people the we represent and for the future the the union
the report is up from the objective to to to to a proposal that political considered is in high extent the reasonable witness and practical workable is for both the institutions if the citizens
i am the opinion that this in my report adequate to the is as the vision the my corapporteur mrs maijweggen the i here also like like thank
i like stress that the here is to a text the must detailed and loopholes are
the is not  speech
that must still follow
i regret the however that the report by some is abused for political profit the the short term
a few cheap headlines and a few concede text in the press places that type people outside the reality
this report is more to aim in the light the the legislation the in august by the council is adopted the socalled 
in my report the emphatically the that the decision the august together with few other decisions must to be particular
where the us to is is a reverberating
if a association the member approach we the issue the public the administration all different but i am welcome that the european parliament the in large lines comes if redoubt against the forces the that from are to the doors the the institutions closed to the for the public
access to documents and information with the to the activities the the institutions the citizens in the the prevention the the eu the responsibility to to and working as a greater efficiency in the hand
i i that convinced that we with the important input the mrs maijweggen a considered and useful text have know the to to the revolutionary changes the for the institutions but also real and tangible benefits for the european citizens
the is clear that article the the treaty a wider interpretation allow the the access the citizens to the documents the the institutions therefore like i with your if a number the the changes in my report to to explain
all institutions and bodies the under article the must expressly mentioned be in the regulation and must not only the committees and working include but all agencies the by the institutions in the life be established
all documents the the institutions must public to are unless there a good reason is to that not to to are based the a  and the a limited number exceptions
the exceptions are moreover procedure and not as some you want do believe compulsory
the term document must broad to be interpreted and must also the internal documents the the institutions include although act documents the  of can be excluded
with the proposal the the commission must a register the documents to be set
that must the documents contain the directly accessible are
the must also the documents contain the classified are if not public with the the  the is applied
the the way has the public know the the there the the documents and has the the possibility a such classification the to fight
also must the access to the documents  are through internet or traditional methods and and that is the large important the new process and the implementation of will audit by the parliament be there
i like also like few other aspects clarify
the classification that in my report the defined is intended to the process to access to obtain to documents easier to make
a application for a document means automatically that there appeal the broad against the application the the 
if a document the requested must the application the the  the case to case again examined to be
we must ensure ensure that the existing or future interinstitutional agreements which i in my report refer if legitimate basis the provision the article have to certainly to to that there a coherent framework the agreed between the institutions with maximum access for the citizens
some member have suggested that i in my text to close dispose the the vision the the council and the commission
in fact and that is very interesting are the fundamental problems the the council and the commission for with my report exactly same differences if the what the everywhere between the majority the the parliament and a number the the smaller groups in this parliament
therefore i i a urgent appeal the the council and the commission this change by to to
the union must closer the the citizens be the
they must more responsibility make and transparent be certainly now we converging the enlargement
we must this opportunity joint opportunity and joint the problems the this stated tackle
i i a appeal the the parliament to my report to support
president the has long took before the european commission a proposal has tabled the the area the the public the administration
a number members the this parliament has here already years to asked
the the beginning the this term i i even a completely initiative tabled the the commission constitutional affairs
on has the commission when pointed that they within a half year with a specific proposal would to and they has floor taken
the is only unfortunately that the content not was what we that had expect
there is quite many criticism the the on the the  the ngos the a number member and also the us parliament
the is therefore also not as strange that there a broad package the amendments is as broad that the regulation however the properly the adapted
adapted the the legislation public the administration in a number member but also adapted the the designate or information act as the in the united states applies
because why would we our european citizens less openness give the relation the brussels than the american citizens to the relation the washington
there is therefore a very large number amendments and i thank the rapporteur the the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens michael cashman for the way which he with the commission constitutional affairs and with myself has worked
what there for us is is in fact the work the the two committees
what are now the most amendments
the most amendment is course the article which the commission seventeen exceptions  for the public the documents and we that have reduced to six exceptions
with the to information on military and  to we also for to a interinstitutional agreement to the between council and parliament so secret information can be informed the a supposedly select committee
this can than assess or the secrecy rightly is
as the the parliament also a link between the council and the citizens and that is the reason why this appropriate in this regulation
a another important amendment is the proposal to not only council commission and parliament but also all external institutions under the regulation to let the
why would we the institutions the paid be by the european commission and which the staff european officials are not to public force
i think that that a very important point is and there will a long annex the this regulation to to that to regulate
than what the the classification to the briefly to the can i i this at with the what michael cashman has said
i understand also not as good the criticism the liberals and greens because the classification precisely important is for the public
therefore has the council there such hate the
a fifth important amendment think i the annual reporting the with particularly must to on the documents the secret must continue least the secret continue
than can still agree per year be examined or that real is yes or no
the european commission has us informal let know that they still not good ready is with the positions the relation the the parliament
that is perhaps not good but if mr cashman that also take can we look or the final perhaps can be postponed
finally president this proposal is especially important for the democratic level the the union
this is the to to the citizens and therefore hope i that the broad majority here in the parliament for the document will vote
mr the president gentlemen colleagues the right the access to documents the the community institutions is a condition for the possibility the the citizens to all the decisionmaking to control and to influence
the this at are we are a transparent and modern administration to create which that right the the citizens course part part
there must course borders the that right be the and also on debate we today
currently there there in the european union already a practice the public the documents and the must not forget that courageous citizens and many progressive member years for more openness have struggle
we start this debate not from the nothing and can the if our duty as the openness to increase and to meet the the criteria the the treaty the amsterdam
the before report sent the situation in many respects the good on from
the is very good that in the report the that the public the documents and the duty to documents to provide the has the all institutions and not only the three 
the is also very good that the institutions the compulsory or would said that their the possibility the is also documents to provide the people the not in the european union live or not citizens the the european union are
that principle must still more be gentlemen colleagues you can the however the imagine that a citizens the the european union the a day information need has on what example the administration the the united states does
there is in fact not few reason the public the documents geographical to to
in the report the however not sufficient clear made or the possible different rules the the the the force be the this regulation continue there the the criteria the more openness meet that is unclear
the is possible that there rules the force continue the the openness to under other the that point have we amendments tabled
the definition the a document is also very essential only already on would we probably the a very year can discuss and that is probably also already happened
the is the essential important that the institutions a certain possibility to a socalled own internal thinking in practice to to this must the however very careful that are because we the the way a situation can create which the working the to decisions lead outside the public be taken and than can the course not influence the the decisionmaking more exercise
to my opinion is the in the report also to far by the right the socalled third bodies to recognise to the access to documents to to
the can the task the the council and the commission are to such restrictions to defend but to my opinion is that not in the important the the parliament and the citizens
a list the exceptions as mrs maijweggen said is the essential important and perhaps the the most part the this work
the is the clear the good on the i like however especially the attention draw the the next if we want that the citizens in the followup the general development the the security can follow therefore the general development than is the exception with the to the defence the safety and military affairs many to extended
they must further defined be or there must a  the be added
mr the president the right the members to secret documents to to is a very important matter but can not the right the the citizens the information replace
this report must also in the parliament still further be dealt and i believe therefore that the also here still will be improve
mr the president fundamental openness and transparency for a democratic way the administrations are a condition for the possibility for the citizens to the public decisionmaking to follow and remind part to take
the possibility to access to to to public documents the for more confidence and legitimacy which the the eu the this at unfortunately quite there
international research shows also a clear the the between a open way the administrations and a low 
the cashman is than also not the first the best report
in this report the the core the a future european transparency the that like say the principle that all documents public must are
there must little exceptions are the also clear down must be
all documents must be registered
assessment must individual to done
repudiations must to be motivated
the the on the the commission foreign affairs times we us against the idea that documents the the area the the common foreign and security automatically and in their whole least must be the public
that would unacceptable are
also the this areas must each document separately be where
we have than also if a democratic loophole proposed that the content the documents the after research not can be issued the the large public can be informed the a limited number members
the is however the important that to point that this proposal not the ambition replaces that so possible documents public be made for the large public for journalists trusted and individual citizens
article the the treaty is on the access the the citizens to documents
the rights the the institutions must further be developed in individual provisions
the cashman is the first step the a long way to more openness democracy and confidence the the citizens
a common directive is necessary and the important
the will also very many effort costs to the drafting and the culture the the different institutions such to change that the presented that openness necessary course effective and democratic is
now wait we the the steps the the council
mr the president also i like just if mrs malmström stress that transparency the precondition is for democratic control and participation the the citizens in the decisionmaking
transparent procedures promote the legitimacy efficiency and a the the citizens between administration
further are they a effective protection against arbitrary power and corruption
that are considerations the for the commission control the are been to in this procedure opinion from to to
the does us pleased that we in the report the decisive principle disbursed which also we if commission control strong favour
this principle reads exceptions the the demand the transparency should only in exceptional prevent
therefore is the long list the exceptions the the commission the the view has not acceptable
we give in the important the the citizens the right signal the by the list the exceptions with through the amendment radical in to cut more to thwarted think i the personally however that a such simplification and clarification only the this although very important point managed is but not in the regulation in its whole
unfortunately was the wish to to anticipate the all possible  and a as completely and extended possible regulation the to to probably more
in place the a shorter text produce we therefore if like the like is a longer
i fear that this the expense is the the greater and the 
more to important is the that the citizens with this regulation not the their fate be left but that the institutions ensure for information what see the can use and where they specific aid to the their search to documents
if we want that the citizens really use can make the their rights have we the this information special trained staff need the the citizens during their search to information if the were the the hand can take and them by the complex labyrinth the institutions can lead
this applies also for the use the the languages
mr the president article must therefore put be and with the cashman to we already a document in the good direction but still not far enough
however deserves the work that the mr cashman in this report has into our appreciation
to my opinion is this a the the most reports the the year
also the opinion the the culture is further than the proposal the the commission
for the public the administration have we us the the nordic models inspired because the tradition on the access the documents this already long there
the culture send the course if its task to emphasise that the language the the rules as clear clear and  possible must are and the there also the that openness and transparency the best instruments are to the problems the by the cultural and linguistic differences between the member the this area the the to solve
the access the documents is to my opinion a important aspect the the information and communication the the eu
all into have demonstrated that the distance between the european citizens and brussels large is and the citizens find itself that they to little the the eu variety
their knowledge on the eu the the by the believe the the media and specific groups often feel the citizens the powerless the the institutions
now the the citizens however the possibility more to know to to on affairs which the media and the groups not particularly interested are so he better armed is to part to take the the open and democratic debate that for the confidence in the eu as important is
i hope that the commission a large effort will do to this legislation to to explain also for jan with the hat because the media and the specific groups must itself their way find to the documents the their interest give
i hope also that the council and the commission us today a positive treatment will promise so we the changes the favour the the citizens and the image the the institutions as quickly possible in the can to
the a hearing the the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens in september  was said that the ten year take to a culture in a administrative environment to achieve we can there therefore but better shipping that make
mr the president there are many way words about on the background the this report
i believe however that we that must point that the affairs the their it be the
the is there in this case to that the citizens the power to to the institutions to control
in the opinion the the commission petitions the under other out the the important the registers
registers are the essential important if we not public want to the amounts the public for authoritative
our parliamentary commission like that the public applies for all documents irrespective or they are up by the institutions or that the institutions they in their possession have been
the can the institutions the  give but in that case must not for ever and always be excluded that the document the either
if the  is has must also this documents can be assessed
we must also the balance make the rapporteur cashman as
the must always the different interests against other judgment the important the a public discussion and the important the the protection the example individual people
the is also the important that the involved parties rights have
we stress that they more rights must have than the large public
now is the however to the access the the large public not the the parliament to documents
the commission petitions asking to shorter times before documents be issued
time is power in our society
we point also with emphasis the the important role the the ombudsman has played for the progress the despite everything made are
i believe that he also in the future a important role will play
we want also stress that the there not to is national rules to harmonise
the national cultures must can existence example in the country where i from come and where the ever the whole transparency with access to documents has invented
mr the president the cashman can in seven words be balance power the the citizens on the bureaucracy
the right the the large public the access to the documents the the institutions is a the the pillars the the construction the a open and democratic union
access to information the also for more effectiveness
this is a clear step forward in the direction the a union with more openness and democracy
the is gratifying that the parliament the managed is a broad majority for more openness to to
i like my thanks thank express the rapporteur cashman and the mrs maijweggen for their excellent cooperation the actually has taken for a good point for the inservice negotiations
and block new exceptions the the area the the common foreign and security are there not and will there also in the future not to
the principle the access to documents must course all institutions and behaviour include
the is therefore very important that there registration is with a register that the citizens a reasonable possibility the to to see what documents there are
public the documents must the comprehensive and fundamental  are but must course be supplemented with certain good defined exceptions
the citizens must because be protected
the commission has exceptions proposed what we many to many were
we have they therefore reduced to
in each individual case must there demands the be the the justification why a document not public can be made
secrecy must also not for indefinite time be was
as the secrecy not longer motivated is must the document course public to be made
there can because strategies are which the before a meeting need has the secrecy the a document but if there decisions are taken is there perhaps not reason more to the secrecy to maintain
the document must than accessible be made
against all decisions on secrecy must also appeal can be broad
the must the can up to the court the justice the ombudsman or the responsible  and the parliament must always question can to the the justification the the secrecy
a another important principle that from the beginning the the  a the my interest is been is that documents so possible in electronic form the internet accessible must be made
this has the parliament the for expressed and the will today certainly again the important that stress and the is indeed important
i think this a very good example the swedish and scandinavian influence the the as
mr the president to to start like i the rapporteurs thank for their very good work
how more openness there is how less bureaucracy how less opportunity to fraud and fraud and how more legitimacy the the institutions the the citizens
i will not to in details the the report like the can course always more wish if the to details is but i will i to to the large lines
the proposal that now the table is is from the the principle that all documents public must are
there are many less exceptions than in the proposal the the commission and the operate exceptions are many more
the large public the the guarantee that the a as over possible access to documents has and this the the most simple way
same applies for citizens in third countries
there will a register the all documents be up
a request to access to a document will relatively quickly be dealt
the countries the better systems have will not adverse consequences the this proposal affected that like say that they this systems can retain
also will there each year a report the the parliament be provided so we the before activity constantly can follow
i like also stress that the all citizens must be guaranteed that they the so ways if possible access to documents to
in our group have we even discussed on the possibility that people or people with a other disability documents can to in a other form than the scriptures
i draw the attention the internet and the other opportunities the in the future the access to documents can facilitate
i like the conclude say that we members us with large agreement must already behind this time proposal the problems are namely not the us
the is there now to that we in our negotiations with the council and the commission a good resolution to the to and to a good result to
that is the most and that is us to
mr the president openness and public in the european union are not in a good light
in the polemical the the citizens is the european union a particular probably the all regulations behind closed doors is to detriment
if member can i that picture confirm
especially the council the ministers is a closed 
also the present proposal the the european commission vote not to 
fortunately is this proposal by the different committees upon adapted also thanks the input the a number liberal rapporteurs for opinion the just about have
the  must be that all documents public are accept exception
that is the like the this parliament
already with already take the group the proposal significant improve but there can still more improvements in be made
i i that that the regulation for the registration the documents to complicated is that the  better can be formulated and that also flouted subjects right have the public
the provisions on the  the commission and council the the european parliament hear in this proposal not home
the  the the political responsibility must not confused be with the  the the citizens
i call already with already the social and conservative groups and the other fact course also the to our amendments to support
president one floor on the position the the european commission because on the council i i the already had
on the european commission have my group and i our doubts
to apparently is this  hardly in the college the there been and is they to now to this as if a especially official matter
i hear this like the opinion the the here guarantee commissioner on
if that as would are than is that a  because the is here to the credibility and reliability the the european union in the view the the citizens
i call the european commission the series that to work the a good regulation the is based the the principle the public accept exception
president mr cashman late there not misunderstanding on there also my group take that your report a large step forward is compared the the report the the commission
there are less exceptions and there there the possibility for member to a own national further legislation to retain
but there are also points the criticism i like there a 
the is the reference in your report the the socalled select committee the commission the research
repeat the the is here to a select committee the the european parliament
a small group european members the in the future access would can to to secret military documents
my problem and the problem the my group is that the regulation for parliamentarians is included in a regulation the would must to on the access the the public the the citizens
the can however not as are mr cashman that if we a good deal for ourselves look where if the is to access to documents we then the citizens in the cold would let are the same point
i remind you remind that risk is not imagined because the european parliament has decided to in appeal to to against the 
but has there same the said that the stands the the matter on is the the progress the the negotiations the the point the the select committee
with other words there the in my view the wrongly a link the between the rights the parliamentarians and the rights the the public
i would than also a call want do the the rapporteurs to any reference to rights the parliamentarians way to to from the regulation the is on the access the the public to documents and i like all colleagues call to very good in the monitoring to the that their interests not be off against the interests the the public
mr the president in this parliament is already many talk on the closer the other to the the union and the citizens and if we this really want than is this project to my opinion crucial
the can to lead that the citizens participation to and active participate the this interesting stake in place the purely spectators or  to are
therefore think i the important that we us in this report concentrate the the rights the the citizens and this problem not confuse with all other affairs the with the access the documents to make have or with the internal wording on the access the the public to documents in the council and the commission
this time is the to the rights the the citizens
i emphasise that we in each case will vote for a as broad possible definition the the understanding documents
now can documents many forms have and we want the access to so possible types the documents in so possible forms assure
this the also in that there as little and as limited possible exceptions must are
the is for i simply incomprehensible that the rules within the community cooperation funds would are than the in the member
the is however unacceptable that the citizens in the union less rights on the access to documents would have than citizens in the member
i can not understand why the so dangerous or important would are that something the this community as the the union as public know the than when something  from the swedish or possibly danish government the the light is
the is than also extremely important that the rights the the citizens the in their own member a good access to the documents have not itself be but that the cooperation precisely to result has that the rights in the member still improve be and the in the union course also
if we the rights the the citizens seriously seriously take and the union really closer the the citizens want to than must there more are than fine documents and great speeches than is the to specific rights the the citizens
mr the president first like i behalf the members the the list bonino rapporteur cashman thank for the excellent work that he to us insight done has
further wanted i that point that we quite concerned are on a number aspects we find that the right the access to information recognised would must be if a citizens and if a political right
to this political and citizens from to exercise is there now internet that within the european institutions still still a foreign  in the hand is although is the now started use to make the internet but still very what opportunities be sources left
internet is something  and today the day is the the and certainly the simplest the costly and most accessible medium
in this sense will we for the amendments vote the the use the internet promote
what specific our concern affects this is in the first place from to the common foreign and security but also to justice and home affairs
in this policy is there not there the guaranteed access to documents not only the citizens the the access denied but even the european parliament that moreover not agree officially the informed late are consulted on vital documents
our second concern has to make with the secrecy where the council the behind refused the the take the acts
currently is the as that the citizens and the members the the parliament not agree to know should to what for positions the national delegations within the council europe and how they vote
if now the council a  is a type first chamber with from than is the for the hand that the vote and the work the the council public must are
the citizens have because the right to know how their government has voted on issues the vital important
our third concern refers the the limited access to texts the comparative examination for hiring in the union
there is indeed a aware the all cases the discrimination and mismanagement in the hand working and that has again a direct impact the the quality the the work that the institutions out
we members the the list bonino are however also the opinion agree that the the affairs not to far to the other on must keenest the is not the intention a  the to force which unlimited access the assured to information or opinions the not few  have
we will there the our vote therefore the ensure that there a honest balance the found between this two extremes
mr the president the position the the commission on the access the the public to documents the clarification in the internal recall that the commission the october the its officials responsible and which they his how they must respond when members the this parliament access in documents questions
the october was this recall the the parliament sent but i i the this night for the first given
if a member the the parliament information asking in the framework the the discharge have the officials the mrs the palacio the task been such ask the to point
only one person the president the the commission control has the right in the framework the the discharge information the to questions
in this internal recall for the officials can the further read that when a member the the parliament in the press a interesting article take and like the on document like consult only one member the the parliament a request this can submit and that is the president the the parliament
this is scandalous but the shows the what intentions the commission with the framework had
if the members the this parliament not agree the desired information can to how can ordinary citizens that  than the
there are therefore reasons enough for all members to to their groups to to
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president gentlemen colleagues transparency guarantee a better participation the the citizens the the decisionmaking and a greater legitimacy efficiency and responsibility the the administration in a democratic system
a absolute condition for this system is that the documents the the union for the citizens as good possible accessible are
the assessment the this regulation must in principle positive example especially because clear the the that this regulation both the has the all political areas if the all institutions the the union
there remains however one large  there
the list the exceptions in article can the broad application the objective the this regulation fully expressed
this list the characterised by obscurity and the the linked legal for the citizens
i think the extremely worrying that the access to documents the refused if and i quote from article favour would can be done the the effective function the the institutions
this provision can the door leaves open for arbitrary
the understanding effective function the the institutions is a vague understanding that also not in agreement is with the justice the the 
to the opinion the the  must the the assessment the the question or there access must be granted to a document a balance be made between the interests the the institution the confidentiality the the document and the important the who the the request compromise
favour the the effective function the the institutions is not sufficient justify to the access to documents to refuse
this provision must be removed or the least be supplemented with the duty to 
the objective the this regulation is destined the the access to the documents with a as large possible respect the the principle the openness
the proposal for the regulation can only the this objective answer when the list the exceptions in article the are least the are sharp sides the upset
mr the president in this chamber take today a very important and seriously debate place a debate on a the the most documents legislation the we if parliament must deal
the is the namely to the relations between the ordinary citizens and the institutions which the  the is in the calmly the the citizens to institutions
the framework for this debate the set by the proposal the the european commission the regard which the european parliament with the report the mr cashman the i thank for are excellent work a position has welcome the question the here however outstanding remains is what there way is in the council
to now to have we not only proposal the the council under view been
we have only the radical and i i unacceptable position given that the mr solana has welcome on the issues on the common foreign policy
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i i a appeal the you let we pressure exercise the the council and him questions the mind to change
mr the president first and especially thank i the mr cashman for the excellent work that he with this report has made
i think that the report a strong signal the the the institutions the the union and the the public
openness in the legislative process and in the public administration forms the pillars the a good working democracy
therefore is the not sufficient that a system formally open is
the must also if such perceived be
the proposal the the commission for a regulation remember i the the famous so the s s on the new clothes the the emperor
the says the a but the does the another
the european parliament must the role the the small one in the so role
the ordinary way the international cooperation with all diplomatic habits including the rule that everything behind closed doors must done with not in the modern revealed the the eu developed has
we must the this thinking from
the public must a essentially unlimited access to the documents have with only few restrictions
otherwise lose we the support the the population for the european cooperation
i add there like the to that the proposal the the mr cashman also consequences will have for the member also already concern the rules only the access the the public to  in the member will the certain documents not longer secret can the with the usual excuse that the a  the
the scepticism the the population the relation the the eu is the result the this attitude which with the cashman a end will be made
the is  for the confidence the the citizens in the european cooperation
to the to conclude like i still say that the unfortunately was that jenspeter bonde the wrong document if point for are intervention the today had taken
he had the in each case not on the cashman
mr the president i thank the mr cashman for are rewarded and refuge work in the commission
freedom the information and a culture the a open and clearcut authorities are strong mechanisms for a better administration and for the eradicating the corruption and embezzlement
since the the mr prodi was the in january proposals in this direction the us presented had we hoped that he here present would are to to respond the this debate
the commission has the during our discussions even unusual on taken but we see from to the comments the the commissioner succeeding
in the council has the mr solana a  attempt risky the to let spend to innocent the agreeing
but if this report today in vote is the the the parliament must to with the commission and the council to negotiate on a code the the citizens with the view will do  against the made  such
publication must us point are and the proof must are the those the that want prevent
the is  that in the european union national authorities their policy develop behind a networks íáôï the secrecy
the law the public the administration as for in article will this short shortcomings that make
mr the president i like my thank express the the rapporteur and the all others the the this report involved were
the is a very important report that a important part part the what we would can reminiscent if the new transparency the the eu
this properly addition this legislative that the access the the citizens to documents regulating also the framework between the commission and the parliament and other agreements as the 
now is the at time to the eu open and democratic to make
the would a large disappointment are if we the not would succeed
the is to legal a effective administration and a effective democracy
we must think that this proposal must to the set the the right the the citizens the access to documents without that they all need to area why or without that they need the to show that the documents their into
we must this not confuse with the role the the parliament or with future interinstitutional agreements
the cashman means a improvement the the proposal the the commission but to my opinion is the improvement not sufficient
we must still still vote for many the the amendments the under other by the group the the free european alliance and by the group the the european liberal and democratic party are tabled
the amendment on a register is the particularly large important
further must the right the the citizens not be interpreted but must they directly right have the access to documents to itself to can of what the important is
mr the president with the before report are we the the good way but the is not far enough
the the public the now often the impression the good information raised by large quantities   under the people to spread
but the citizens assess the information not the the latest but the content transparency and intelligible
the is precisely that with transparency and public found if corruption and waste more prevent can be
the last report the the court late see how urgent necessary changes are
i like what say on three other aspects
the first democracy based the participation the the citizens and must encourage to act
what happening there however when the not or not sufficient the informed when there a maze the rules  which a member not agree the way can find late are a normal citizens
the is there the the information however also to that the citizens are own interests in our decisions  if the example to  or other affairs is
the second be the documents often up in a language the a lawyer not agree understand late are a citizens
and the finally is the appropriate secrecy even for the members the the parliament as large that many facts the we finally also need have for our own decisionmaking as hidden continue that the
technical interference
mr the president the up rhetoric the the europe the the citizens is not back to find in the restrictive pricing for documents the commission and council proposals
want this institutions the citizens fact the the europe involve
from their attitude that earlier a choice for centralisation the power
why is elected for a regulation
the is however to documents the the institutions
and why are the  as broad formulated
certainly now in the council not unanimity requires is is the only possibility to  the the parliament
fortunately is with the  tried a document the to to which the right the access the citizens to documents regulated is and not the right the institutions to limits the to to
but also the parliament no not the 
as contains the report amendments on the right the the institutions to documents to classification if secret than the public amendments the especially are at the increasing the own influence
but should this subject actually home in a regulation on the right the citizens the access to documents
the  the the parliament the that from the many amendments lead also to the the the a difficult contribute regulation
and that while transparency and openness necessary to the involvement the citizens to guarantee precisely the best be served with a clear simple regulation
this hear certainly we if parliament us the to the
mr the president i like the mr cashman thank for are report that is supplemented with the opinions the the members maijweggen hautala malmström theato thors and andreasen
i think however that the mr cashman scenario the all institutions except the council because the council is a black gap in this european union the council is the large unknown the outside the  the
i think that the a step forward has the to application the the right the the citizens the information and knowledge
probably will the with electronic resources succeed the citizens this opportunity the information to give because a and another automatically is without that the per necessarily claim not to make the a only important towards to questions
i think also that the would must try as the commission petitions and the ombudsman argue to the necessary awareness to give the the institutional and bureaucratic passages the proposals and measures as can also be member who where responsible is what how than also always the the administration is without that the responsibility in all the divided
i had the on responsibility because i think that the citizens through the necessary information protected must be against the misdeeds the the 
if the this not to was than would here only but there are the a expect to knowledge
but precisely with the view the the right the the citizens the the to scenes against mismanagement the the authorities the information a need
than still a last point there can not there are the right the information therefore the right the the citizens to protected to be against mistakes the the  if there not easier more comprehensible procedures to if the procedures terms number and type not reduced be
mr the president the first my thanks thank the rapporteur michael cashman and the already those the a contribution have made the this report
transparency was to now to hardly more than a  slogan if the to the transparency the the activities in the institutions was
the cashman with are demands is a first valuable step forward but to my opinion also not more than that
we members would more courage must have
we will a european  in the life to tributyl  was that over the parties and the parliaments the
this initiative will there from meps from national parliamentarians but also from representatives the the media because the the intention is that we us joint against against the untenable  the the institutions
the is the not only to the principle the the immensity access to all documents but the is course also the important that we there last in succeed to the doors the goals to open so the council in the future not more or la  in the secret shrug decisions awaits and then than a cheap  can to companies
precisely the representatives the the media are the i invited to us members to support and together transports to out so we everything find what the citizens like and must know
tomorrow already will there in london a meeting place
we will the british minister the foreign affairs and the minister the different to understanding questions and the weekend then will the european council the artists in madrid meet and also this will the  a central place adopt the the agenda
us example for this everything is the american designate or information act and the transparency as the in sweden in the practice the the
the is not coincidence that here almost only britons have about and from germany and italy but very little to hear was and from france believe i at nothing in any case to now to not
the is good from that the sweden next year the presidency the the council the the will take and perhaps can they than still a considerably more signal give
we have in any case a new age the enlightenment need and the is a large opportunity for us if parliamentarians to here really us were face to let see
mr the president i like the mr cashman thank for are good work
he is however not the only the i like thank also mrs  maijweggen the the group the through the closer hughes the second rapporteur is must you be thank
i am pleased that they in this matter good and successful have worked
transparency and democracy are important values in us work and the can be achieved if the registers on existing information also the secret stated information compulsory the
that is a principle that i in my own report on the access to information on the environment if point i taken
the is also the important that the citizens to hear to when a document that the the at the application because protraction or confidentiality still not public is available will are
i like the attention draw the a matter the the has the the public the information the in hands is the units the under the commission the or by the institutions are up
such units are example the european agency in copenhagen and the very soon the to up agency for the food
the documents the the units must course clearly under the legislation on public the
i think the by the mr cashman elected technology however not good
the scattered the the units in separate annexes is technical cumbersome since there new units be up and other be reformed
the would better are in the paragraphs itself rules to create the all units force their documents to publish and registers on the to to
the second like i point the the exceptions
the set the exceptions is a quite sensitive matter because also a good report and a large increase the transparency the in the heads the the citizens easy overshadowed by a  legislation on exceptions
course must there last a decision be taken on the public on the work the the council exceptions should the council not the possibility give the behind to continue behind
the is however just as important the the  bordering attitude the the citizens to change the example the major by the excessive secrecy around documents on the safety and the defence
the is in fact also in the important the the safety that the citizens the possibility have through facts and documents to assess how confidence they in the european defence have
mr the president we are us now in a situation which we actually can say that we steps take in the direction the already years the called and which the principles in the treaty the amsterdam were accepted
transparency must the  be the all work the the european union the right the access to documents is the the however still not enough to the transparency to achieve
we must ensure ensure that the work the all institutions are based the transparency clarity and intelligible and that the in that the structures the the decisionmaking clear visible must are
the must the bureaucracy avoid
the deadlines the the the publication the documents be the must effort deadlines are because in normal circumstances the citizens course access to documents have
i think the also very important that in this report a annual control the proposed because the the a annual control carefully the lists by can take the documents the not published could be
in the stage there than the possibility also the political grounds after to to or the motives for secrecy the documents effective are been
i hope that the report here in the parliament good the received
president there is a  gap between the positions the the parliament and the positions the the council and the commission
this gap communicating the distance between the european union and its citizens
our population see europe if undemocratic a place where behind closed doors decisions be taken
the gap the also a democratic gap in europe
information is finally a essential foundation the the modern democracy that by public debate media and public control and input the social organisations the major
our proposals here in the parliament help this distance
i like immediately stress that the large majority the the parliament the proposals supports including our colleagues from countries the perhaps in their own country less the tradition the openness know
i see this agreement within us whole parliament if a large achievement which the european parliament subject that this a  fight for the european democracy is become
i from that the council in july a serious mistake has made by all documents on military affairs categorically secret to explain
this decision communicating the way the still must be made before we in europe actually a democratic controlled security and defence know
the european parliament asking than also that in the future the european security and defence the component in the structures the the european commission
first must now the indigestible decision the the council be tackled
course recognises the european parliament the need the secrecy the certain military affairs but than the the basis the the assessment the the content the any individual document the the hand the verifiable criteria and procedures
parliamentary control the secret documents can then place through a select committee the the european parliament
president access to documents is the fundamental important for our european democracy
the council and the commission must in the next weeks in negotiations farreaching on the bridge to
as not than will the social group together with other this its the law try the to force
mr the president the first vote the i to pleased that i here for the gentlemen members the position the the commission on the by the different committees tabled amendments the the proposal for a regulation must explain we are the there moreover all on agree that the before regulation with the view the the democracy and the progress the our society a fundamental role plays
also like i here my or would said our enormous appreciation express for the efforts the the rapporteur the mr cashman and the author the the proposal mrs maijweggen to this report in such a short reasonable for to to
with article the the treaty must the regulation before may to be adopted that like say two year after the force the the treaty the amsterdam
before i us position presented like i you that attention that the commission its proposal has drawn the basis the our experience with the voluntary code the the over six year and the application the this code one and the analysis the the legislation the the member hand some countries are because particularly familiar with the to the public access to documents
the treaty its the citizens the right the access to the documents the the european institutions accordance certain principles and conditions
as that from the proposal is the commission the believe that a better access to documents the participation the the citizens in the decisionmaking will promote and the legitimacy the efficiency and the responsibility the the authorities within the democratic system will increase
therefore is openness the principle although also the defence the the general important and the respect the a number special protection  rights must be guaranteed
that is the fundamental balance that we must achieve
our legislation will also a another not less important balance must maintain the balance between the three in the treaty the amsterdam order institutions
this the course not way that also the other institutions there good the would do the regulation to support as this the adopted
in the speech the president prodi the october here for the parliament has taken has he reference made the the institutional triangle he has when stressed that in a the monitoring and balance based european system the clearer force the each the the institutions the general important the good is
since for any institution a specific task is play clearly the themselves that also their needs and obligations differences
thanks the report the the mr cashman know we now clear what the priorities the the parliament are
the council has however the regard the a number important provisions the the proposal still not final position welcome
this we this currently in the consultation situation see the commission the to must in this stage the the procedure only a general position to formulate
there are because different amendments the we not can support without forward to are the the future negotiations and a final position this
the commission the with pleased the that the european parliament the many points with the proposed approach agreement is
more still the amendments based normally not the principle problems
we would however more must like the the whose and the practice this openness transparency and public access to documents expressions are the a attitude the we in our respective services must promote and achieve
i think that many those the maximum transparency and the the by way increase efficiency the the institutions i am a the them few years ago surprised  when was that a member the the this level model because to are during several years the fine was been the maximum confusion and minimum transparency with particularly the regard the certain population
this shows that no perfect is and that we our forces must pool to this type situations to prevent
now would i with your if few problems want address the the commission there the this at the from certain amendments the to take
a the the problems is the necessary balance between openness and efficiency
i mean this with particularly the texts for internal use and the  and preparatory  the only for internal use the the services the the institutions for are
all national legislation this the this documents from
by the institutions to to force this internal guidance know to make will we the citizens in many cases only but in confusion to
as a the you rightly has said are we here for a paradox since lack the information more than agree the result is the what the information
given this am i the believe that the access to preparatory documents not relevant informative gentlemen has
the the way would we also the creativity stamp and in the institutions purely bureaucratic practices promote
i believe that this precisely the conflicting is the what the institutions achieve
i must admit that the large challenge the the before regulation intention in the definition the what exactly under documents must be what
i think that we us in this respect far must continue make to a common definition the to to the the approval the all institutions symbol
although i here today the amendments the the articles and that like say the amendments and not can support means that not that the discussion this must be any the is because a point which we progress must make
also the treatment the the  or by third drawn documents the for problems
the institutions have the this level not experience since the current system only the by the institutions itself tabled documents in eligible the
the proposal the the commission on documents the third the account with the provisions the the last intergovernmental conference with particularly with statement no the the treaty the amsterdam where we not above can with this is the the the institutions and the the third people to to decide or this documents already than not should be distributed
the amendments the the parliament times this roles simply to therefore are we the believe that this issue more must be developed and that the proposal for a new article  amendment still not sufficient wellconsidered is to the the support the the commission to can count
further have we the before the some other amendments time need to the consequences and the efficiency the the proposal to evaluate we must there also for ensure that the included procedures not bureaucratic directed in the life to but other really for all citizens accessible are
here hear example amendments home the the have the measures what through a interinstitutional agreement must be decided that like say the amendments and
as i already said to some amendments in principle our approval way although they from technical and administrative view still any joint consultation require this is example the case with the amendments on the classification and registration the documents
the commission has already since decades years on a classification for documents
with the principle that the documents the a classification must be subject have we therefore not only problem
there is however not discussion held on the fact or the different institutions already than not identical  must maintain
in this stage the the legislative is the premature to as in amendment the suggested a position in to take regarding the question or a directly the between classification and access to documents already than not desirable is and or the before regulation to this end a appropriate legislation must contain
the the that in the amendments the the between legislation on classification and legislation on the content the the register from us in this stage amendment on the register the to take
i like here moreover emphasise that the commission the next amendments in principle essentially fully can accept partially f and
also is the commission the believe that we the condition the only changes a agreement can achieve on the amendments and
perhaps even on the amendments the last part the amendment and amendment
although the commission here today only but general positive observations on a limited number aspects can formulate and we us whole not or only in cautious very on other amendments can express means this not that we not prepared are a debate to open consultation to commit and points the agreement between the three institutions to seek
we hope that the mutual cooperation us in the opportunity will to this regulation in the month may the to take
i thank the rapporteurs the the this document have involved again for their commitment
i thank you very mrs the commissioner
mr the president i would like a point the item want submit or in any case a appeal the the rules want do
just have we commissioner the palacio heard the in detlev a large number amendments has mentioned the for the commission acceptable are and a number other the to its believe by us rejected would must be
would the not possible are of a writing overview to to
we must because on ten minutes vote and no has the time had to the scriptures the to the what amendments mrs the commissioner mentioned has
i concerned this comment because the here present commissioner fact always oral the  the the commission express makes us the not only writing document the available the
i would like see that the commission now but also in the future its recommendations writing the the members does sent
i can the unfortunately not agree are with my mr the mr poos
the is not the the commission to groups to tell what decisions they must take the regard the the amendments the by the different groups are tabled and therefore must the commissioner also not in such difficult position be the
mr the president i i the floor asked to same comment to make if the mr poos
the mr cashman has course right if he the that the commission not one from to make what position the groups must in to take in the plenary sitting
however are there also members the now and than the certainly confidence have in the wisdom the the commission and i am there this one the
sometimes would i like accordance the evidence the the commission want vote but this is the indeed need that we if members a overview to the the amendments which the commission the can agree and a overview the the amendments which they not like agree
the is then the the members the course to honour and conscience a voice produce to their position to determine the regard the the evidence the the commission
president i like with the the mr cashman that the this at the process the parliamentary decisionmaking place
i i the commission the i fact very thank for a large extent the  because that can we the the also hear say that they the certain parts still not january can give
that is course a whole important comment the will also think i consequences have for will
but precisely because the commission the parts i see the commission also  still not really january can give is the also a little dangerous to things now already black the white to to because than to they a own life lead
therefore i would fact the this at want questions or the parliament in certain sense still independent the the position the the commission are own decisionmaking continue can to and than can we see how the rapporteurs further with the commission can be to to to to a final attitude
that seems i a better order
i take knowledge the the here concerns opinions
the debate is closed
the vote take place to at
welcome
own ability the credit
the the item is the report the mrs villiers a behalf the economic and monetary commission on the assessment the directive eec on the own ability the credit ini
if a bank bankrupt is than has that further consequences than the a bankruptcy the arbitrary what another company because the savings the people in the affected is and the stability the the financial system in risk can to
therefore there there special legislation to ensure to ensure that banks  continue and can survive and not bankrupt to and this legislation is up to savers to protect and to the financial stability to monitor
the the global agreed in basle but the current framework meets not the the demands the this time because the always same  compulsory the
for a broad range the different risks must a equal amount money aside be the
the be banks encouraged to higher risks to take because this means that a bank can to for a higher premium the same compulsory 
the new proposal the the commission that the economic and monetary commission in large lines the i supports the in that how lower the risk more to lower the compulsory tax
that means that banks be encouraged and rewarded for the minimise the risks and the in the the the the necessary  the relation the their backlog obligations
in us report behalf the economic and monetary commission to we a number political demands
the first that in the new legislation account the taken with the diversity the the bank and  in the european union
this legislation is the application the many thousands small and large banks and investors and must appropriate are the already their needs
the legislation must as simple possible to to apply are by this institutions
we they us in the direction the a more refined system
that not not more bureaucratic and complicated system to are
within the commission have we with only reluctance the role accepted the the commission like transferring the external  with the reservations that this a role is with restrictions which the most are that small companies not monitor need and that companies without monitor this not affected the should affected
despite are we the opinion that the important is to the to give that the internal  the banks and internal  the heart must forms the the new framework
they forms the best basis to a  framework the to base for a large part the the  sector and their clients and small companies
we are welcome with the closer status the is granted the  in the particularly the deposits that by small companies must be offered
we can us there also that unite that there the the long term probably need there the a new tax for other risks but the want we clear to that a such tax not must be set to there a suitable method is to the other risks to determine
we accept also that regulatory bodies the competence must to to special and supplementary taxation the to to the certain banks
the new framework the many confidence the banks
we give their not permission to their own  to determine but this would we the suspected close the in the near to if we their internal systems not good in the monitoring would the
therefore must sadec can have on the supplementary powers to individual taxation the to to to ensure to ensure that individual banks the the the rules the
to finally and that is the most controversial has the economic and monetary commission urgent called to use to make the a up procedure to this legislation the implement to to
there are amendments tabled the a more prudent approach stand but what us all unites is the science that the last time that there a  was closed the the united states three months cost to this from to to while the european union there more than three year on was
that was not only three year which banks in the european union a serious competitive had but also three year which the european consumer a modern hightech regulatory framework was abstained
we must ourselves if legislative power incisive questions to or we the do what the best is for the people the us have elected if our law and legislation already overtaken is for the can be included in the code
we must all opportunities in one take mutual recognition up procedures and other procedures including because the dangerous is to legislation the to to for the market the yesterday
and that is what we do unless we our procedures review
where we for must ensure is that we can have on legislation the flexible is that we a way find to the quickly to implement that we a way find to the quickly and simple the to apply the new developments that we a way find to to ensure for  in the different member and that new procedures the be set subject are the the necessary democratic control
i like a appeal do the the mr bolkestein here today present to with proposals to to which the parliament the can consider to the this crucial needs meet to to
they are the vital important for a healthy services in the european union
vote
the parliament the the resolution the
report a the the mr blokland on the by the conciliation the european parliament and the council approved common text on the incineration the waste c cod
the parliament approved the common text good
report a the mrs figueiredo on the proposal for a decision the the european parliament and the council to the the a community action the encouraged the cooperation between the member the fight the social exclusion com c cod
figueiredo guengl rapporteur
pt mr the president like like i the plenary sitting inform that the amendments the i if rapporteur behalf the guengl i tabled the outcome are the negotiations with the council and the commission and the support enjoy the the group the in the commission employment and social affairs are represented also is the presentation the this amendments motivated by the need the codecision to simplify
as know is this procedure the this report the application
this amendments to in the place the a number proposals in the report the probably in the vote will be rejected the new amendments which agreement is achieved will this therefore replace
the parliament the the legislative the
mr the president just have we the absence the a number mr programmes voted on a statement on bse
i would however like the the next want point if there one body is that there the the mad the disease the primates than is the the the computer the the lifts
we have ten minutes nothing can do because only two lifts normal mine the the at the the votes
i would like want that there a research is to to determine by what alternative the the disease the primates our computers the are
president must i the liberal group questions i question the also if one the the corapporteurs to the a little consequently the to tackle
because what they do is the a large number articles still in parts vote while the often only but is to one part where they against want vote
therefore must the a little consequently and more the the liberals
mr the president the is particularly unfortunately that the both rapporteurs fact not good consultation have committed
the is here to very important legislation and the is here also to important articles
we if liberals and few others in this house also wish here very very clear to make that we for a improvement the this  are
therefore the sorry i that there to little consultation is committed
we want show how we the interests the the citizens here maintain
mr the president given the very broad support for this report and given the answer the the commission morning is the clear if you look to all parts which is voted that we accordance article member the vote on the resolution must postpone to fruitful negotiations the to to with the commission and the council
i hope that the parliament this proposal supports
the parliament decision the vote from to to
mr the president i understand that there not possibility is to now to vote on the  and the limitations
i like therefore argue that the vote this the postponing to the partsession november ii
also the proposal the mrs theorin the asking to postponement to the second partsession the november put i in vote
mr the president the  and the limitations are night late dealt and the was the intention that we there now on would vote
the group the the european party has the i same wish expressed if the i just consider namely the vote on this reports postpone to the partsession november ii and there evening therefore not on vote
the majority the the women is the journey to a conference with members in berlin
the is therefore a common wish the the european party and the party the the european social that the vote the postponing to november ii
mr the president a thing like i clear make the was not the wish the the european party to the vote from to to this wish was the us presented
personally can i agree agree but there are also other opinions in our group
i can under one condition with the postponement agree namely if mrs theorin this time to november ii use to improvements in its report the to to because this version can our group not adopt
i like still something otherwise very clear make and that is a principle point if we thursday not ready are with the votes than is the normal procedure that we thursday further vote
the is not in item that we the vote postpone because programmes night a number mr programmes not here can are
therefore to a long story briefly to make i am behalf my group for postponement to november ii provided mrs theorin declared that they the a improvement the its report will work
applause the the group
for what the second point the therefore the fact that there afternoon votes taken be i believe that we that all know and the is matter that we the present are
mr the president the sorry i that i said that the group the the european party also wanted that the vote would be postponed but your coordinator was actually the i and said that you the vote also wanted postpone to the partsession november ii in place the evening to vote
mr poettering we have worked with your people and in the groups the the european party and the the party the the european social are we the agree become on the content the the report
we were the agree on the central issues and we were the agree the the negotiations
i  i to the wish the the parliament but the is therefore to a agreement the the european party and the party the the european social both on my report if on the central issues the
i must than also say that i very surprised am on this response
the parliament decision the vote from to to
mr the president the the agenda the also the vote on the report the mrs villiers included
but that report that still not discussed to are the debate on take only evening place after the votes
by the vote on the report the mrs villiers from to to to tomorrow the the this report not right done
i i than also for the vote on the  from to to to the next partsession in november
the vote is planned for tomorrow and than can be to postponement asked be
for the at remains the report however the the agenda the tomorrow are since the debate still not has place
mr the president i am the completely not agree with what the the this at happening in this sitting
the last time see we still more that during a partsession ask to postponement the in same period planned votes be tabled to purely personal reasons example because the the a vote not present can are
i i brings our sitting with the take the this type decisions itself in disrepute
mr the president in unlike to mrs theorin question i not to votes and debates to until because that better former in my own personal synchronised
i will here afternoon than also certainly are to in debate to to on my report and i will also present are when the tomorrow in vote will be the
the reason why i like proposals to the vote from to to is that the here as the mr goebbels also has indicated is to a very important issue
not only the the financial services the the item the but the can also farreaching consequences have with the to our procedure with the to the codecision and with the to our relationship to the commission
that is a vote which colleagues present must are
i like than also with urge ask to the vote from to to to the partsession in brussels
joint resolution on the third meeting asiaeurope
the parliament the the resolution the
mr president a appeal the the rules i like only say that i also a important report the this agenda i are
there the tomorrow on discussed and voted and i am very grateful and proud that this the a friday happening
president there is this precisely voted for postponement the my report
i i the agreement but if you the order the the list had followed and not first on the cashman had let vote because a number people here evening not are because that is the reason than had the also still on the limitations can vote
i i the order were the i by the services is given and this house has not otherwise decided
i had otherwise like done what you says
mr the president i i somewhat dismayed the that the vote on the report that i here morning would standing and that the the agenda the morning the included just is postponed without that on about is
course can there the always problems arise but on changes the the agenda must we the time informed to be
normal about am i  always present but afternoon must i elsewhere a reading give
i can therefore not the the votes the afternoon present are simply because i not the time warned am
and i am however to the members the whose presence not many the to see is
the my turn would i you than also want ask the vote on my report from to to to the next partsession in november
but i would this still the something want add
we have morning a example the document  parliamentary act given
i know not how a rollcall vote costs but the is probably to hundreds french francs or belgian francs from our budget
we have the typical way a hope time and a hope money wasted only and only to a few mr programmes a pleasure to do
i am the opinion mr the president that you this matter the the conference the presidents would must present so clear the by who excessive use the made the votes in parts and rollcall votes and so this last perhaps even the a ceiling bound can be
this everything is to ride for words and our sitting has the morning completely ridiculous made
mr rocard i give you the a economies that this issue the presented the the conference the presidents
for what the list the the president change the order the vote not
possibly is the the sitting the otherwise certainly i put only the one point after the other in vote
president a appeal the the rules
michel rocard has large right what here happening is that a few people the the opportunity use try to make to their interests the they in the parliamentary commission any not have can stands still a time to the to to
they ensure there than for that we rollcall votes must the the fact at not more the nature the a rollcall vote have
that is the targeted attempt the a few people to the the expense the others to profile
therefore have we the first a good wellconsidered system for the rollcall votes need
the second the is not good that after the to my opinion traditional mistake the the parliament to the friday the to abolish the people the end itself have said that they the friday not more wanted have now also still to protest
my question is there there now any against the decision the the parliament to the friday the the agenda the to to
are there to been legal any
how will the there in the next year look
we have probably also in the future to make with the situation which we also now regular situation namely reports time again to must postpone to the sitting in brussels in place the they here in  to deal
can we this something to know to
for what your first comment the mr mann the issue will course be referred to the bureau and the conference the presidents
this is the only that i you today in my capacity the presidentinoffice president can inform
if mr other can i you say that i the with you agree am unfortunately must we the rules see to change
for what the friday the the is i not for that there something news to report is but the issue will how than also under the attention the the conference the presidents be the
resolution on bse b
mr the president i like like a vote make with the to the resolution on bse
i i voted against the fully overcome the companies because i not believe that this the best way is to bse from to racial
i i heard that there farmers are the in place the to report that they a animal have with bse that animal would  and buried
i know that they in france work with the overcome the whole companies and that seems i not the right way
even the scientific steering says that this not necessarily the most effective procedure is and that the overcome the  as we that in britain know the effective is
i i also against amendment voted because i not believe that this possible is but i i the for the resolution if whole voted in the particularly because the ban the  and  for all  as we that in the united kingdom know since
i i for the resolution voted because we need have the strong legislation the in the whole eu the application is
mr the president i i for the report voted that is on the initiative the our sitting with the to the serious crisis the the spread the this epidemic under cattle has caused
i wanted emphatically explain that i for this report voice under more with the intention paragraph to support
i hope namely and question this than also that the immediately already the are cattle that in the  in the whole european union to cannot the offered is inspect to to see or the already than not free the bse rhinotracheitis spongiform bovine is
the whole account must  controlled be how that also is costs otherwise falling the sale the beef under zero
guengl writing
el the commission and the council the the european union to a large responsibility for the extent the the  under bovine
apart the the fact that they in the beginning when the european parliament the dangers in the united kingdom the the denounce started to to were if there nothing the the hand was have they in the subsequent stage when the scandal in the united kingdom in full extent to seen was has only and only measures for this country affected there was not few agreement made on a immediately applied programme with strict measures and restructuring the the farming the paneuropean scale
the has now this cases the bse in france discovered because france the only country the the european union is that the own initiative decided a has system to to apply
now there there absolute uncertainty and concerns on the dangers the us over the head depend or the consumers or the authorities are of the the informed
therefore must the immediately
measures take the paneuropean level
comprehensive and strict control to out the all herds in very the european union as the imports
meal remove from the speaking for not only bovine and sheep but also pigs chicken and fish
measures take to to prevent that through this radical restructuring the the farming genetically gm  from the united states brazil and other countries our market inundates as not number scientific proof there for the safety of and the there to now to not
the debate that yesterday in this chamber is held on the mad and the safety the feedingstuffs has especially demonstrated that there very many confusion there on the responsibilities and that the opinions very strong divided are
the powers in this issue be currently shared by the community the already few rules with limited scope has become a ban the meal in feed rules the regard the the  the meal the compulsory separately the the specific risk tissue and the states the the the right want reserved regulations to take the appropriate are the the situation in their own country as the right without precautions to take the protection the the health the their citizens
clarify is here already far to seek and the confusion the still increase by two other problems the the one on is the difficult the states the one line to to when the is to the introduce the more controls
some countries including germany want their farmers not texts with additional costs because they hardly affected be by this disease the the other on is the monitoring the the compliance the the different national rules a problem
border are there almost not more and the labels give not january on the country the origin the there there a large risk that people meat the their plates to that from is the pigs the major are with meal even in countries where a ban there the the use of
the this at there there seas confusion as yesterday also clear was from the words the the french minister patriat and european commissioner byrne the the way totally say seem to are
this situation shows the how irresponsible the the last years to work is has the the to the to the the internal market the first step the now the must be is the whole matter carefully review
we must the rules on labelling change certain controls the national level  and other controls in the life to further must we the the the the the very limited to the european legislation emphatically from to to the the essential right the any the to a step further to to or to precautions to take
succeed we there not in before everything more clarity to provide the regard the the powers more line to to in all measures and more recognition the to force the the about the the national states than will the role the europe in this issue only a negative are exactly as today and a down the the responsibilities will of the result are
content given favour my group for extremely strict measures the fight the this epidemic
that is however not enough fires put is a good matter but fires prevention is still many better
we believe than also from this issue four important lessons to can draw which in the future account taken must be
first lesson  production must rejected be because this type tragedy programmes of the inevitable result is
a quality form the agriculture lead perhaps to higher costs but the savings the the  in first body seems the to make change the term in enormous items for the whole society
what this the are we very concerned on the fact that the commission are is all resources to seek to again genetically modified products to to are although on the consequences the the use of as good if nothing know is on ten twenty year would this products the agree can lead to new tragedy programmes the similar are with the bse
second lesson a quality form the agriculture the a certain extent the independence the  possible makes has not survival in a europe that dominated the by the global aggravating
however the commissioner lamy as seems the currently to utilisation the impatience to after seattle a new cycle international  the the to to which he also a place like implication for the agriculture with the intention the agricultural for the another time the to apply the the market
that is unacceptable
third lesson during international negotiations must the commission under more monitoring the to be the the member so misdeeds i would fact must say action the treason if the agreements the blair  and longer in the future prevent can be
the is the intention that in the future treaty the nice the the commission during international negotiations more power granted the we are however the opinion that the commission during the negotiations precisely more controlled would must be by the national governments and parliaments
fourth lesson the policy that is at the full abolition the the controls the the borders must carefully review be
also must the dogma the the free movement contained to be the dogma the on which the commission in is in against the member the a boycott wanted up against british beef the dogma also that for the commission in the is been france for the court the justice to days because that country refused the boycott the to lift
despite everything what there currently way is see the commission there not mislead in the to the the its complaint which they late see that the free movement the goods for its indeed a something inviolable dogma is
if the member a end want make the this type principle must they the treaty the nice opportunity to the to insist the restoring the their right the national level precautions to take the protection the the health
we have a voice issued for this resolution despite the fact that they very late is and despite the mistrust that the us raised the by the obscurity the a number wordings
we protest against the fact that the as took has before there a fully ban is set the the production and the use the meal while the already ten year know is that the a role plays the the spread the bse
further can the on the the vague wordings in paragraph the necessary question the be the the to the the authorities with all available resources doubt and put to to the the practices the fraud and compensation the the large groups in the agriculture and industry the would very what easier are been in few words clear to make that the production and the use the meal fully banned are
we have a voice issued for this joint resolution
there is without more there the a crisis
the crisis affects however not only the beef we have also to make with a economic crisis and with a financing problem the the area the the health
all stages the the meat the the cows in the wei to the meat the table are the this crisis involved
the consumers have all confidence lost and to this problem the to tackle was the absolutely necessary our call to repeat to as quickly possible for all bovine compulsory tests in to to which bse effectively can be
this measure must accompanied to the a immediately ban the the use the meal for all animals the the whole territory the the union
that is simply a specific application the the principle
we have because already many to long waited
the whole union must the this matter involved to be because the can not as are that one country draconian measures the with all economic consequences the this while other countries secondarily their activities can continue
further remains the number fraud unfortunately no high and the only way to the this fraud a end to make is a ban the the use the meal the the whole territory the the union
thanks this type measures can we the consumers reassure and achieve that the message the solidarity towards the farmers the we as like want transfer actually comes
the european parliament must pressure from to exercise the the commission the in its proposals during the debate quite terrible is been
the surprised us that the commission the not aware the the the extent the the problem
the finally up this crisis without precedent a clear light the the already years visible restrictions the the common agricultural
now is the is the farmers to help to  in place the more to produce
also in this respect have we already many to long waited
moreover make some the ensure on the arrival the genetically modified products the replace the meal
but precisely by the cap radical to reform a reform the now need become is and us to up the the cultivation the vegetable crops the  areas can we prevent that we our resort must take to largescale imports the genetically modified products from from the united states
the health must the objective the the cap to be
by the increase the the number cases the the new alternative the the disease primates in england and by the situation in france the the  bse still given that the already was
moreover was this matter always already in gathering issue by a lack the transparency and because to the the highest level in few member the the european union determination information was being
where the here fact to is is the food
both the the mad if the the  and also the gmos programmes is the clear that the health the human and animal in risk the the by the amounts objective to maximum profits to achieve
the consumers lose the confidence and the predominantly be threatened
if the common agricultural not the amended will the problem around the food worse
within the cap is always favour for intensification the the production human  and able which especially the interests the the  and the large multinationals  are strongly
the problems can not radical to necessary be has only and only by a european agency for the food the to up and strict legal measures to take as the ban the meal in feedingstuffs that although a positive effect has but to late is introduced
there must urgent further measures be affected the common agricultural must amended to be
the recent cases the mad bse forms a unfortunately negative confirmation the the given that the union properly  what the safety the food the that is more to vacuums if the know that the use the meal in feedingstuffs already long if dangerous was classed
already very long ago  we in this house for this risk without that the however measures was take the is therefore matter that now as quickly possible the in to the necessary procedures the to to which a end made can be the the use the  the bovine which into can be transferred
there must as soon possible implementation be given the the proposals the the commission in the paper on food has formulated with particularly what the the creating the a agency that guarantee the for this safety there is now already more than a year has and that agency is still still not operational
the the now really time to in to intervene so the governments not more here and the stretched make as we that now witnessing the damage the is caused is every not low because there are two sectors that involved the closely with other linked are the health the the human and the health the the account therefore the economic sector the the farming
also must not forget be that france time by going the europe the embargo the beef from the united kingdom not if stands because there when not measures are affected is france currently with the hot  and is the country case with same epidemic
the is need that the commission now immediately a ban blocked the the use the meal also must they say what the the current the the knowledge the safest method is to the if dangerous theatre parts to destroy as brain and tonsils
in pending the further information from scientific circles would the a sensible idea are also  to destroy to therefore the highest guarantee to to that the human health actually protected the
the cases the bse the the in france have occurred are just as the chickens in belgium only the last in a long series examples the without action
to however especially not panic to good under the citizens or to the trade not with disastrous consequences the to encumber have some governments the necessary information not activity passed the the commission while other there simply not for taken have as the first dangerous symptoms visible were to the consumption the the on products immediately stop to to and a ban the the implement the to announce
this type without behaviour must very strict the the denounce the be and to to prevent that certain situation the still agree arise must the a down regulation introduce for all countries the the union
we can really not just do if the internal market good work if we not common rules up the as such crucial area if that the the human health
the the see the this type insecure situations respond the citizens rightly with the necessary fear and refuse they products to consume which they suspicion that the harmful for the health are
this is also a demonstrated the mistrust towards the european union what because in the view the the citizens not guarantees know to offer for the safety the food the the the market be the
also therefore to ensure to ensure that the citizens their confidence back is the addition protection the the health absolutely necessary that the union shipping the behind its decisionmaking therefore can there a number common rules the table to and can the ensure ensure that scientific institutions and bodies the will must ensure on the food as soon possible in force be the
the ban to meal to use for feedingstuffs is only a first step the this way
there is there the a  the the consumers the meat the also the traditional and quality agricultural affects although this not use the made the meal
different industries with particularly in france have itself a number obligations imposed to the quality the the products to guarantee and detection the the origin that possible to make but the effect of the fully way by the lack the confidence the the consumers the doubt not only the the safety the the products itself but also the the procedures the intended are to the safety to guarantee
we can not nothing ensure how entire sectors to the  to
the  must although be there must a procedure introduced be which bse systematically effectively can be and there must a ban to the the use the animal protein
here can europe are exist the full proof here must europe the really up
measures the national level have not sense when punishes rules not also apply for imports from from other countries the the european union or from third countries
there must without more a ban to the the use the meal in feedingstuffs because we the origin the the components not can back but that ban brings the the necessary problems with the that
must we that meal now incineration or store
that is only possible if there special factories built be so damage for the environment prevent can be
and what must there in the place to the that meal
in first body imported oil and cutting products which we not know or the to genetically modified types is or not
the negotiations in the framework the the wto must urgent reopen be to the european farmers to to are the production the vegetable protein the to to
without aid the outside are the farmers not in the the head to offer the this crisis there must than also a programmes for the farming up be and there must measures taken be to the confidence the the consumers back to win
the one because also to the responsibilities the politicians to account to the with the human tragedy programmes the the result are the this problems
the is time for a comprehensive debate
the treatment the the paper on the safety the food offers this the opportunity
let we the opportunity opportunity
the debate the yesterday on the bse was in many respect significant
i would that want point that this debate especially thanks the efforts the our group union for a europe the national states has can place also would i want point the the very coherent resolution the we have tabled
we have there end that agreed the joint resolution to support and the am us that the despite all shortcomings and shortcomings with as large majority is adopted
we regret however the very that the by our group tabled amendments not are adopted
however seems the us absolutely necessary that the community budget used the the the implementation the the new safety the be imposed the the farmers and than think i especially the all people the working are in the beef the been affected be by the loss the confidence the the consumer
not less necessary is the that with immediate commit the wto reopen be on the part oil and cutting products in the agreement the longer that very may you for the european producers we must see to avoid that the ban the the use the meal lead to largescale imports the oil and cutting products the possible genetically modified organisms contain
from the debate the yesterday that especially how the opinions major on the question how this crisis the best tackled can be difference the opinion see we the all levels between the member between between the political favour and between the community institutions
indepth differences there there the regard the the meal and indepth differences there there the regard the the tests
but we have the to make with a very fundamental qualms which not only the health the the population in the affected is but also the future the a entire sector the in a number member the large importance is for the social balance
we can in this crisis therefore not enough with half measures or vague compromises for that type codes decisions is completely not place when the is is the precautionary to to apply and adequate measures to take with the view the maximum protection the our population
the debate has also clear made that both the presidency the the council if the commission properly the the mess are in this matter
the was already with already rather ecip to see how the presidency the the council the in all manages  to are responsibility the to it all does would to expect are the the future european authority on food if the label european guarantees that the matter really seriously the tackled
the accusations on and again which the debate the yesterday was  the is the debt the the council
the is the debt the the member
the is the debt the the commission let see that the community does in fact only work if a system which the all sides responsibilities can be  this is the expense the the core the the matter a effective protection the the health the our population
what the commission the the has must the that there large differences there on the question what resources used must be to the crisis to 
the commission has the need considered the precautions what a number member decided has ridiculous to make by the floor  to let the in the with the total the the use the meal
they  the inaction the a number member but has the not few way to know given the the the court the justice tabled were against france to let the that persecuted the because the whole rightly has held the the boycott the british beef
the commission the clear only a balance for view the for the countries the the most demanding are the regard the the safety not more but a less means given the public opinion given the political like the the member given the extent the the epidemic and given the important the the involved sectors for the economy and the society would the member the on the the subsidiarity again sufficient freedom must to to their population actually to protect and their safety to guarantee
given the the inability the all european institutions council commission parliament to a adequate community policy the to to which meet has can be the the needs the safety the the directly involved member will the still very what effort costs to a balance to find between the rules the the internal market and the demands the regard the the health and the safety the our citizens
how can we example the confidence the the french consumer restore and prevent that the relates position when the french farmers a fully ban the the use the meal the imposed while same the imports the meat allowed the that from is from member where the animals still still major be with meal and where the the testing the animals still still reject
the like the the member the the the food and the health the the consumers the highest priority their must the full respected be same must the member the right to priority to to the decisions the scientific founded are as they also the right must to the precautionary to let considerations over measures the based are the a compromise between the different positions the the partners which especially the most favour partners benefit have
remains this everything scrapped than will beyond the to to are that the community institutions the the their do and let not let lead by the subsidiarity
blokland a
mr the president the fight against pollution is a very important problem as we all know
pollution the especially caused by the large industry including companies the waste incineration this waste is the other companies but also the the ordinary daily activities the the european citizens
i i for this directive voted but i wanted the stress that i with this voice the i also something otherwise the the view i i think that the european union right has if they the addressing to who the sordid air the by this industries the emitted  but also must the union the also ensure make and perhaps still the more to the people the in this type companies work
i believe that the a demonstrated the consistent action is to the working the people the in this type  companies work to reduce
because if this companies to outside to pollute than be you the look what for air there leaves the factories depends
today is there a end has the a long process that had into in the adopt the a directive on the incineration the waste
the proposal the the european commission dates from but many differences between the parliament and the council have to led that the october on the conciliation meet was established
today speak we us therefore from on the text the the result is the that consultation
i i that that the directive both the has the the incineration if the the coincineration the waste
the the here two methods the waste the part must of the one few comprehensive strategy the also prevention reuse and recycling the waste includes and which the coordination the european level must place
during the debates in first and second reading the the european parliament i i my distress expressed on the fact that dangerous and not dangerous waste possible not in same directive included would be
this completely justified concern has the european parliament to the the extremely critical the to to and a number amendments in to must which a strictly framework the the for everything what to make has with the incineration and credibility the waste
after many discussions with the council have we the a number points our sense been
that applies example for the values for the emissions during coincineration the on the general in kilns place
the standards are down in a separate annex but if more than the the waste that in this type plants incinerated the from dangerous waste or mixed  local waste there must this plants meet the the more standards for incineration the in a other annex down are
the european commission has vegetable waste from from the agriculture the woodprocessing industry and the food the the directive want out
in are second reading has the parliament waste the  added that the the the production the natural citrus and paper the basis the citrus when this  likening must be
the parliament is the managed on this point during the necessarily a agreement to achieve
further have the efforts the the parliament also the a another point to success led the plants for the incineration the radioactive waste are expressly the the scope the the directive excluded
the parliament has also the creation the more rules for the function the incinerators individual as a better access to information for the public
to finally would i again want stress that the fact that dangerous waste the still greater scale processed can be there not to must lead that we us not more pressure make on the produce the this type waste
the most is and remains the prevent the the produce the waste that is the  the the strategy the the european union the this area
in the european union makes the the serious ensure that there not sufficient the done the the implementation the new proposals for waste
the million citizens the the eu demands action the this point and that is completely rightly
in europe the there daily per person per day more than kg waste cofinancing
the basis the there in the eu billion tonnes waste cofinancing
the situation can not ever continue
the european union must clarify provide on a aspect the the solve the the disposal
the future the the waste is not in local authorities the all in europe the find to to new landfill
there there a serious and growing concern on the consequences the landfill for the environment in the general
i part the concern
i am the opinion that the work with landfill end place will must make for more integrated plans for waste
the european parliament has the last years a role played the the develop the new strategies for waste
i support the objective the the directive the we here today discuss this directive the the negative effects the incineration the the environment and the health back to insist by the  in the air the various important polluting substances considerably to reduce
this is also part the a wider european environmental that that at is to the use the polluting substances in all economic sectors in europe to reduce accordance the obligations down in the agreement the kyoto
the european union shares fully the strict ambitious but the achievable objectives the the area the recycling and reuse as the are the by the irish government
this objectives the in the next year achieved must be cover the next the the a other way processing the the already the domestic waste that now still into the a minimum reduction the the biological biodegradable waste that now still the drew the sites the development the  where the work with environmentallyfriendly technologies which to tonnes biological biodegradable waste per year processed can be
already this measures reflect the changing public opinion on waste
the age the the valid the the end and must flat for more environmentallyfriendly technologies
 a
mr the president i i for the  voted that is on eradication the social exclusion and poverty as in the report itself the
i i there however the by the how there on a few amendments is voted and i think that than also very regret
i am there absolutely the convinced that the responsibility for social exclusion and poverty for the the governments the our fifteen countries is
the are other simply the challenge the to to both in the past if now still to to see who social exclusion and poverty still worse can make
if the pensions namely what less low were than would there also less poor are
why you you group the the european party against the  voted the amendment that i personally i tabled which was that poverty also a cause is the low pensions
i think this very regret and hope than also that you the a next vote the mind change
the report the mr figueiredo can a good contribution are the the fight the social exclusion provided the the cooperation between the member the that area the strengthened
therefore must the council ensure ensure that
the appropriations for this programme considerably be increased
a specific timetable the included in the national programme programmes
in all involved policies account the taken with the efforts to integration the the social groups with special needs
account the taken with new forms the exclusion as exclusion the the society
the social bodies and with particularly the representatives the the with exclusion endangered groups which the programme for is be involved the the implementation
the programme the focused the the fight the poverty under children women and elderly
a european network the up which not only the phenomenon the social exclusion can be registered but also the programme further can be developed distributed and adapted
we have us the vote abstained the regard the this report even now the the amendment amended is
the most reason why we not ardent this report have voted is that the rapporteur there a number good intentions in preparing
unfortunately be you the basis the good intentions  not policy to even not 
europe counts officially million poor that is the the population
this means that a considerably part the the working classes the a the the richest region programmes the world in poverty live
the million poor to not from the air the their poverty is the result the the greed the a privileged capitalist classes the everything does to the capital to increase and the unfettered the to introducing
in the report is a amount the million euro for the next five year for to the poverty to combat
that is euro for any poor in europe
even in terms the charity is that a ridiculous amount apart the the fact that the  not a issue the charity is
we aware that not only report and not few vote even the the european parliament not change in this situation can to
but in the report had the are least clear made can be who for the situation responsible are
how the also they we have not against but also not for this report voted not only are the specific proposals the the contains inadequate also the in the report the exploitation the the workers the real cause the the poverty the the working classes earlier confidentiality than fight
this programme the fight the the social exclusion is a the the priorities the the french presidency in whose proposals the social europe the red premises is
i i that that in lisbon a community strategy on social integration is the
i can not otherwise than that initiative welcome that important the the expectations the our european citizens
because we should us than the verheugen in a restoration the the economy and a fall the the unemployment that like still not say that we the social inequalities the earlier increase than reducing under the carpet can ends
social exclusion is a reality as that from the statistics the eurostat approximately the the population the the european union must the to with less than the the average national income the  which work the to relative poverty to measure
the unemployment is the has but there are still still million people without work in the european union
and unemployment must than the most factor are for poverty and social exclusion that the not way that the could nature the the work and the low rewards also obstacles forms for full integration in the society
to many citizens must the the marginalised continue are
therefore must we strong measures take the the area the the social security as measures the improvement the the access to public services if health education housing etc
i endorse without only reserve the proposal to the the fight the social exclusion a second process the luxembourg the the to to which a number guidelines and the necessary national action programmes down be
how fruitful this method can are have we the the area the the employment can see
the european council the lisbon has the the objective the the the european union a competitive society to make the for everyone open
this are increase efforts need the that at must are everyone training the to offer in the new information and technologies and everyone access to provide to the new networks
the concept universal service must the this area a important role to play
the wait is now the nice where the member to i hope a strong signal will give the their political like the in to to for a comprehensive strategy the strengthening the the european social model by the social agenda and the charter the the fundamental the to take
the most objective the the report is the support the a common action to cooperation to promote between the member the the eu to social exclusion against to to
i am the opinion that the institution the a such common action not only sensible is but also very useful can are
we are there not the from to a divide to create in europe a europe the the haves and the haves
we want the gap between rich and poor not increase
fact is that longterm unemployment and youth the concentrate in certain areas in the european union
concentrations be been in certain black  within many situated and urban areas in the european union
the develop the initiatives to the problem the social exclusion against to to and to the weak in our society new hope and opportunities to offer must now the core are the the policy the all governments within the eu
the principles the the this programme the basis are are the create the a open method between the member to poverty and social exclusion from to racial
that must be achieved by clear objectives to determine the must be  in national plans and by policy in to to that equal opportunities must promote
i think that the rapporteur right has that he the public the social partners and citizens and their organisations stated to the now more in to effort to to to to measures the poverty and social exclusion must prevent
if result the the treaty the amsterdam must all governments the the eu new plans the regard the employment the assessment and assessment  the the european commission
the european commission must already this plans evaluate to to assess how success the governments the the eu make the the eradicate the social exclusion
we must in this issue the other learn
otherwise will the gap between rich and poor in the eu only but grow
in this the am i welcome with the most provisions the the programme on the social agenda that recently by the european commission is published
this know the european social partners a greater role to in terms the the design the different directives and regulations
the relationship with employers will improve
there is continuing national and european support for local employment
there is also a improved coordination the ideas the the area the the society modern services and the internet runs activities
ireland has a free hightech system the social rights and rights the the area the employment and many the the directives the be up base the the the irish model the the area the social partnership and 
the all europeans must the with less than the the average national income to that like say that million people the a low income must those which the  fact if reference for the measure the relative poverty
this figures give the that there action must be taken the state and government have to in lisbon for the first time in the history the poverty and social exclusion the the european agenda the
europe can because only but a economic strong power are if the from social view fair is we are than also welcome with this progress
to the reason will i i for the report the our mr express they has the because not only behind the proposal the the commission supported but the text also content improve
in the report the favour for the the the qualitative and quantitative indicators for social exclusion
the is very important that we within the member the the union all the basis the same data on this issue can talk
also the in this report indicated that the member energetically to work must to and the the up the their national plans precise defined objectives the must to to
also the there again use made the the open method be the involved parties encouraged the dialogue with other the to to social partners ngos programmes local and regional authorities etc and be there networks up
our commission employment and social affairs like the financial reference the the million euro in place the the million euro the by the commission is proposed
to finally like i say that the here to a step forward is the we must consolidate and encourage economic progress only enough because not to a better quality the the life the our citizens to guarantee
in this report the clear made what the current european europe has led million poor and million unemployed
the current restructuring and mergers lead to new redundancies
while there there is the a strong economic growth and the unemployment obviously decrease that that work now not security more offers against exclusion the circumstances which poor workers life are not the picture to mention
with the indication poor workers objective i with particularly the the women the in exposed work underpaid be and in full uncertainty situation in the official speeches on the growth remains this group workers fully outside one
the right the good work concern housing and training are basic rights the employers and member would compulsory must be this rights after to life
the this way can we the citizens because against social exclusion protect we will than also for the report the fight the social exclusion vote
many members the the today for this text express have the yesterday however less solidarity shown when they a charter endorse which the social rights not guaranteed be with this charter the because the fight against exclusion be to a form the assistance what a step means compared with the current legislation in many member
we can exclusion better combat by example a guaranteed minimum in europe the to to
the special summit the lisbon on employment economic reforms and social cohesion the march created for the first since times poverty and social exclusion again the the agenda the the union
by a proposal for to to for a programme to social exclusion to combat the the commission respond the the call the the council to for june a initiative for cooperation the this level to present
according the data the eurostat live such the the population the the eu the less than the the average national income which the  if yardstick the taken for relative poverty
the proposal the the commission to a common action the to to to cooperation between the member to promote to social exclusion against to to there from the promote the a better understanding the social exclusion the streamline the the promote the participation and the develop the  at the certain target
the strategy must in three  the implement be the
rail analysis the the characteristics causes processes and trends in social exclusion rail cooperation the the area the policy and exchange the the measures the the most effect effects rail a dialogue with the various interested
the open way the coordinate the stressed the the subsidiarity respects while all relevant operators active involved be
this are all welcome measures but just if the rapporteur am i the opinion that the programme best what applause had should are
i support than also are amendments
i am welcome with this report that to more resources asking for the proposed european programmes for the fight the poverty and social exclusion
cooperation between the member is the crucial important to this deepseated problems the to tackle the the all in the union arise but in the particularly in my own constituency in the northwest the england
television side and  properly to the most deprived  areas the very europe
we are unfortunately but already to good know with the web the problems which  areas bogged are discrimination social exclusion unemployment crime and escapism but with aid the european programmes to social exclusion against to to and european money can local communities last start to the to selfsacrificial the this evil
the british labour is still first has in the fight against poverty and social exclusion
three year back proposed the prime the   unit in the collapsed to social exclusion against to to coordinate by to to with a broad approach for related problems
the unity working together with other departments the also to make have with social exclusion
i i fully behind this innovative approach the especially the many young people the good is has by means the a strong approach the  and  homelessness  and the offer the support the something the not training or work have
this is a wonderful example the how the labour specific benefits obvious for ordinary people
i am there strong the convinced that we with a new radical approach not only a other way can approach but also the applies can to and that we the a day poverty and social exclusion in the northwest fully can eradicate
drafted a
mr the president i i i to a very precise reason the vote abstained according i has this report county about not the progress made where i to 
i i the for already the amendments voted the to serve the alternative energy from to extend but i had the i hoped that the a further step forward would to
i know that the difficult is i know that this report already the right way has path but there must still many more done be and therefore hope i that the the national and the european level this policy the alternative energy with more hand will changes
mr the president with the drafted in each case with the the described  for renewable forms are we the the point to the long term in and for europe farreaching mistakes to make the the area the the energy
therefore i i the report rejected
energy must a vision have sustainable are and at the the market
with this report achieve we exactly the opposite
with the sustainable subsidies the biomass when and hydroelectric we we the wrong way in and to we only a symbolic policy
there to billions the subsidies to a few companies the with their hurdle the landscape disfigure
the is meantime to plants with more than sixty  the thousand  in up take
the consumer and europe have the the secondbest with this policy be the benefits the our political the liberalisation the the markets again way
mr the president i i for the report voted that doing on the promotion the electricity from renewable energy
i am a clear favour the energy because that have we hard need but hand have the elderly and pensioners energy hard need this must they always on can have
i think namely the the cold nights and the cold  both in the north if the south the europe if many elderly the lack the financial resources unfortunately forced be the heating from to work
if example the a excellent form the cut wanted i the case the the city  because where a system the  the applied that even benefits the the incineration the waste the incineration must this both to electricity the to give if to directly heat to produce the then to all homes the the inhabitants the  the led
i hope that a such system in all cities in europe application take
we want the usefulness the the promotion the electricity from renewable energy the the internal electricity not in doubt draw
the is because a good matter if this the employment with new jobs can increase as in the report the indicated
we find the also not objection that the research the this area and even the exploitation the this energy such be supported that the consumer earlier for renewable energy will choose than for electricity the through more polluting methods the using
but why must this support lead to the private profit which currently there is
the subsidies will because the good to the companies the the with research to and the trade the this products are the i think the the companies if total  shell  from  power  a daughter the president  s  a joint establishment the  more  and president and other industrial groups the already enough profits make and the therefore not the taxes the the citizens should received
the production and distribution the electricity would a public service must are
why ensure the member and european institutions there than not for that this public service in hands is the public services the directly the necessary workers would can appointed
the this way need the profits not the the shareholders the private companies be elsheikh and can there therefore appropriate salaries be paid and can there a good functioning public fyrom be guaranteed
during the debate that night in the plenary sitting place have many the us the expressed on the need to the incentive the electricity from renewable energy to promote
same was in den hague the conference on the greenhouse taken the scientists and  conceal not longer that they the ensure make on the consequences the the greenhouse and also the citizens are the slowly but certainly aware the this consequences
the very short term will the consequences to expected very completely are therefore must there the european and world level clear measures affected to be the basis which a further of the the environment can be prevent
the proposal the the commission and the drafted which we today voted have for in this need there the because the that the renewable energy a friendly alternative forms for what the the electricity
with its proposal is the commission its own announcements fulfilled and meets they the the demand the the european parliament to a fundamental step to do the  the the objective the the paper the a doubling the the percentage renewable energy the the total energy with commit the
the member will the this must make only as can because the environmental be achieved the they the the european and international level the have and can they their independence the energy guarantee
the dependence the energy the outside the eu is currently approximately and danger in to to to take if the renewable forms the energy not be extended
the eu the in the world first if the is to the construction the plants for the various types the 
to in this sector competitive to can continue action will the union the on technologies must use and further develop this requires considerable public investment
to already this reasons and because the quality the the drafted i i for this text voted i hope that the commission and the council us will follow
course am i favour the a active promotion the electricity from renewable energy
only by means the technological progress will the soft energy the can develop the ideological premises have we nothing
we can ambitious objectives formulate and the member force this after to to but if we our countries the necessary resources not in hands to give will the objectives not be achieved
some proposals the the european parliament are not realistic and deserve than also not my support
the european commission has to objective the that the share the renewable energy in the energy for the end the the doubled
renewable energy forms a very important part the a effective strategy the protection the the climate
peat is in finland a important renewable source with a share the in the total amount used fuels
otherwise than in central is there in a northern country if finland many peat
also international experts have noted that peat a important  is which the annual growth in finland clear the use that exceeded
the  regions the finland properly to the  where to little trees grow the if source can must
peat is especially in the regions a important fuel and is this also the large influence the the employment
i am satisfied that the european parliament this facts mature by peat in are report on renewable energy to let are
the member the the european union including finland have the linked the the achieve the the objectives the kyoto the retain the natural resources and the reduce the the emissions the harmful substances
the importance the nuclear the therefore constantly to
the is clear that the the the the use the nuclear and the storage the waste must the the more advanced and more safety
the finnish    asked yesterday november the finnish government a portion to take on the construction the a fifth nuclear
i hope that our government and us parliament positive are the that request
a responsible use the nuclear offers a environmentallyfriendly and cheap source which the use not unnecessary must be limited
we know all that the future the our energy not based can are the our current forms
that see also the commission in and more still the rapporteur because they the that alternative energy respectively the alternative incentive the energy a greater priority must to
i thank mr been than also for its good report
our experience with traditional forms is that they farreaching consequences have for climate and environment insecure safety programmes with the would and also not  are we will therefore the first the development and application the new forms still many more than previously must promote
the the long term would this the subsidy for the traditional and outdated forms unnecessary must make
a first step to would are to consistent all obstacles way to take the the application the renewable forms prevent
also must the future better succeed to practice practices the everyone know to make
the objective the each energy and economic policy must the second are to the energy to reduce respectively to optimise because only a pillars its with resources the what form than also help to financial consequences as low possible to the
we demands in this the a way research to the external financial consequences the the mobilise and apply the renewable forms
the finally must the energy only staterun be when account the taken with the special conditions the the alternative forms
decentralised need witness not only the a structural policy but has precisely also a social aspect
therefore must the third the liberalisation in the energy not place without that social minimum writing are down
we can not the the existing way continue with the mobilise the electricity
coal and oil are the term towards and cause co
nuclear can lead to disasters the large parts the the earth  make and produces a dangerous 
we must therefore the find to energy the there the nature already is but the gone but as no the technology developed to the the to out
the is little ambitious that parliament and commission the use the the energy the next ten year only want double
incentive the electricity from water when and  is still still to scarce and that makes the to relationship duration
any like a as friendly possible way the  but any like also as cheap possible energy
that applies in the particularly for people the not many can pay and the the if first concern have that the costs the their parity as low possible continue
if clean energy expensive energy remains will the also still long  energy are
afforded  to the freedom to within a liberalised market voluntary the to to the a cleaner energy while for the rest everything the the old remains
clean energy must for any available to and affordable are
with the to six points as the incineration the peat and organic waste watching i the by greenpeace requested rejection
 iii b
in  was there the a stark contrast between one the official summit the state and hand the demonstrations the the citizens which also i simultaneously
the state want the neoliberal reforms up while the citizens here any against have
the unions and social organisations reject the dictatorship the the large traditional industrial groups but want also not that the imf and the wto the for the say to
they want not that their country again economic colonised the everyone asking the because the what western companies the suffering korean industries will well
the alternative forum has the interparliamentary contacts encouraged the think i with particularly the the meeting the the october in the national korean parliament place
during this meeting was noted that the elected parliaments outside the asem taken were while businesspeople precisely the all meetings present were
therefore must the interparliamentary dialogue  between western and asia new life to be dialogue
during the preparations the asem iv must the need to democratisation to be stressed by one ensure to ensure that elected members the the civil on the necessary information can have and can intervene to must with particularly a social forum to be up and hand the social rights human and the rights the environmental fully to let entitlements
this is the vote concludes
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
urgent
the the item is the debate on topical urgent and particularly important issues
 parliament
the the item is the joint debate on the next motions
b the the mr seguro others behalf the group

b the the mr marset campos others behalf the left
b the the members salafranca sánchezneyra and garcíamargallo y marfil behalf the group
on central 
mr the president as know its the european union the does through the commission the council and especially the european parliament very close links with central the institutions this and with particularly the individual countries
we maintain this relations from respect and the support the the consolidate the the democracy in this region and the promotion the the human so this in this part the the world just if elsewhere will be respected
a the the priorities the we support if the is to the individual countries in this region is regional integration
we are the opinion that regional integration a essential means is the the promote the the three by i mentioned objectives
in central there there already a bureau the promotion the regional integration a  bank a  court and a  parliament
and the is surprising mr the president that the parliament together with the european parliament the only the world is where the members directly be elected
the last time is the parliament target been the only configured and even the criticism
we have a got received and committed to not only in political respect attention to to the the role the the parliament in the region but also the with particularly the relationship between us parliament and the central parliament
the before resolution join the the the work the in the past by the delegation the this parliament for the relations with central under presidency the the mr salafranca done are and the we during this mandate the modest scale continue
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes mr the commissioner this resolution has therefore if objective political support to offer the the  parliament a the is democratic forum that whole from own like the centre must to are the a topics debate in this region same want we this the signal give that europe for regional integration is in this part the the world
we have only the a point a difference the opinion that moreover not the essential important is and that the paragraph the this resolution if this paragraph the approved the the european parliament in our view a to aidoriented attitude the
we abstained us the vote the this point but the important the the resolution is that they political support offers the regional integration and the the  parliament
mr the president gentlemen colleagues mr the commissioner the resolution on the situation in central the here today the the parliament the presented is particularly relevant with particularly in the light the the recent visit the brussels the a delegation the the  parliament
i would this three important reasons want because the document for document the have the this specific american region we should course nor forget that a strengthening the the dialogue between the european parliament and the  parliament also from political view essential and necessary is
the is to the next three reasons in the first place stressed the resolution the important the the consolidation the the process and urges they the the the strict respect the the human with particularly the regard the the indigenous population
the second join they the the the celebration the the twelfth latin summit the soon in panama will place this will about be on the the justice and fairness based obligations the we in the new millennium the before the children and young must into
also with our resolution perfectly in the current philosophy the the european commission the to objective has the external actions the the union in the countries the latin america new life in to revive with all consequences the this
we hope or would said we confidence that that the necessary resources will be allocated to the the regional integration in central a new impetus to give this is the necessary and essential that to all time the way the political  consultation the committed
therefore are we welcome with this political statement the us parliament on the  parliament especially this they this institution a fundamental role much in the integration the the countries from this between north and america the region
mr the president must i you there just the point that i since eight year member am the the delegation for the relations with the countries the central and mexico first under the presidency the the mr salafranca and currently under the presidency the the mr seguro
i remind i very good that the mentioned delegation in already the years excellent relations with the  parliament and the other latin parliaments has maintain
the is best possible that the excellent understanding with the  parliament is to to write the the fact that the representation in both cases the similar criteria based
both the  parliament if the european parliament are directly eligibility
i remind i still loud that the mr salafranca together with the president the the  parliament a document on political consultation between the european parliament and the  parliament signed
the the way wanted we ensure ensure that the  parliament still more powers was on still more financial resources could have and a leading role was play the the integration the the region the the represented
if i i not mistaken the mr salafranca will the this doubt better remind were we four year ago by the institute for the relations between the eu and latin america invited the a meeting in  a wonderful city in guatemala this have we when with our colleagues the the  parliament like how the future look had see not only the the the  parliament but also the the the european parliament
we could when moreover the that the  parliament same fate the part was if this parliament that initially also with all difficulties to camps had as had and has the still still all effort the the world to more powers more resources and more control to acquire and the to do apply if representation the the people
that is i i a the the still repeated themes in the debates the the interparliamentary conferences together with the economic and social problems which some countries from central and america the victims are
we are here for two essential objectives one must be avoid that the social inequalities increase the result the the currently in the region new economic policies and hand must ensure taken be that the parliaments contribute the the integration the the region what doubt in all important is
there be course here and the attempts taken to the powers and the presence the the  parliament in to limit that is moreover nothing news but dates already the the up the this institution
a parliament the now once if tow perceived i believe however that the  parliament just if this parliament and other parliaments the serving must are the the population the the represents although the established power this not except fortunately that is
therefore hope i mr the president that the before resolution many support will find
mr the president the speakers the before i the floor have held have the also already said in this debate want we our solidarity and support express the the  parliament
we do this the a at that here with man and power the worked for the conservation the the priority treatment the the external relations the the european union with the countries from latin america to far have were that is the underlying idea the the report that the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence the own initiative will up in cooperation with the competent delegations
as you and we all here in the parliament know mr the president are the parliaments for the difficult task to the the development the our societies the leadership the the to take and if first the find to to to adequate solutions for the many unresolved problems this must they the democratic values and the social justice strengthen
in the case the the  parliament is this mission to as to say still important this the integration and demultiplying the the relevant society the basis the peace consultation and reconciliation a enormous challenge means
i i are we the managed the on the the statement the which also mrs gonzález álvarez reference has made a useful and realistic cooperation to the to to we must the continue not shrug to the with the words the the mr seguro to say but the like way as our president all tasks the he the the the can from to to
i think that the european parliament in the is with quantitatively facts the to show that the the work the the  parliament particularly positive  namely by the are experience and are support the to offer
the there not doubt that both the european if the  parliament in their respective integration a still important role will must to play
the is not in our intention i believe moreover that we this if members the the european parliament not the most appropriate people are opinion to give the the members the the  parliament
the  parliament will are own way to the will are own political direction see in a central that according i again master the itself like and must be with respect the are unity in diversity
basis the the common roots must the the broad range the possible options and the many opportunities the the process find the must the values if peace freedom and solidarity high in the hold to and sufficient view have for the longstanding necessary the 
therefore am i the believe that we the additional criticism the who the activities the the  parliament  if  conditional or surprising know fact and without hopes with urge must condemn
the  parliament must just if the european parliament are prestige credibility and legitimacy increase through the work the the groups the the and woe the the political parties is or would because a faithfully reflects the the by them represented society must are
we must to to strong parliaments in the life to to the participate the act the question the debate and refute the ratify or correct the are conviction the values the the freedom defend the the driving the the political development the the region are and the progress progress also have
therefore mr the president want we with this resolution our support and solidarity the the  parliament express same want we the commission ask the by the  parliament the the services the the commission  multiannual support to support especially this this institution us i the integration in central date and a new age the consultation and peace communicating
mr the president mr the commissioner i hope that the relations between the european parliament and the  parliament in any case better function than the  the this chamber
this is logically a the this issues which almost everyone the agree is not only this parliament but also many members including myself the because their origin enormous sympathy feel for the cooperation and  the institutions the countries the we a little if us own country as
also we support the  parliament because the contributes the the strengthening the the democratic structures therefore precisely must we if european parliament a such institution support support
i part the any not the our mr and friend the president the the delegation for the relations with the countries the central and mexico the mr seguro here in the with the problem the the human has expressed
the  must for my or amended be but the intention must retain continue
i think that we in this respect home must continue have what we want that in very the world shortcomings we should our look not they when the human elsewhere the earth be violated
to back to to the the last part the the speech the the mr salafranca wish also i that there least sufficient financial resources be budget to the i i important activities the we in cooperation with the  parliament must out to a good end to can to
i am there the very the convinced that we enough  have and the act the the floor must add

on the situation in ivory
mr the president ivory was long time if a relatively stable and prosperous country in a by disasters occurring africa
therefore were we very concerned and disappointed on the gradual political economic and humanitarian suppose the this country the military junta the general  was this responsible
to the the power to can continue has general  the by the  people adopted constitution to are hand the and if weapon used to are political opponents from to can decided
also has he a carry debate on the specific   held what to a wave the xenophobic has led hatred towards the another and towards the abroad
general  has the country therefore not only the the periphery the a war the but also the the periphery the a ethnic war
the  people has the junta however not fully are the let to the has the bullies the the flight said when the a old opposition laurent  to head the the government competition
ivory could as the process resume this process must now quickly be confirmed by free and transparent elections which all political forces in the country must can participate
both the politicians if the population are currently favour the such elections
the  politicians are the last weeks their responsibility not from the way has and have the upon in the country restore also have they work the a law and the national reconciliation
we must note take the this resumption the the democratic process although the still not is completed must we the continue support
i i is the stability the the whole region the might africa is the what this point the because in a particularly vulnerable stage
the union must ivory hand the the path that the country itself is path and which the return to the law and the civil peace and the economic and social progress a important role play the union must this country from equipment and financial view to support the the organisation the the elections the the december next taken will be
they must there course the ensure that the elections fair has and a visible nature will to also must they its cooperation with ivory continue and the find to to solutions which the social crisis in the cities and the crisis regarding the land the the rural the best can be us
that is the objective the our resolution
ivory was to for briefly if a economic  the extremely large confusion the the last weeks during the elections in ivory is in is however  for a country that the in a economic and social crisis is and where there is the a political chaos
the real issues and the national debates were overshadowed by the misleading but questions debate on the specific  
ivory is the to two reasons in the closely one is the country financial obligations made order the confidence in the economy to restore and hand being the the cruelty harmful consequences the the international negotiations
what we here see is a  the a actually sustainable development or the the policy the the future that by the greens the appealing
the require not speech that the west in important extent responsible is for the sinking the the  model
the european parliament has because allowed that chocolate with other fats than butter must be prepared which the whole national industry the the first  the world is has also the political and social situation in this country is criticism become
take example the  citizens the in the  back are found they are the ultimate and direct victims the this chain the cause and result the are origin has in brussels and end in 
the greens condemn the violence the during the elections have place and regret the victims the this violence
the democracy can in ivory only return if there a independent committee the set the the been crimes is into and if the official side the committed that the human will be observed and the civil peace maintained will continue
the peace can the only the credible way place if there a national  the up and there a national  is the the next elections will prepare and offer will are for the good way that i think the with particularly the the elections the december next
the presence the foreign observers is moreover essential to the legitimacy the this elections to guarantee
president is the upon really  in ivory or seems the but as
 is time recognised if president the on the elections which are most opposed was excluded
if the elections in december not honest has will the disquiet doubt again increase
the violence the the last period has because deep encourage us the the population
the the least or slightest political abuse will the  again to the across intervene
therefore is the absolutely essential that the elections in december honest has and exclusion the on the ethnic reasons is course from den because
ivory can are stability only back if the the new power the willingness there to also power to parts
also is a sustainable peace in the country unthinkable without religious and ethnic tolerance
the political military and religious leaders must everything in the work to to a national reconciliation possible to make
there must a constitution to the the rights the the citizens and political parties guarantees and power does
the is also the the the important that the relationship with the neighbouring in the particularly burkina countries the restore
we if european union must prepared are to the  continue to to but this can only if the country properly the run and the democratisation really giving the
the leaders to now a new opportunity and late they this also intervene
ivory can a example role and a regional role play
but that can only if any are responsibility the and the upon once is 
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the most issue which ivory i i the head must offer is that the the democracy according some is the important the the democracy relatively when the to africa is
personally am i however the opinion that the the area the the democracy compromises not possible are and that the problems respect in ivory similar are with the problems the the example in guineaconakry arise as everyone know be in this country people the wrongly in the prison locked and there there in this country not democratic system
already almost a year long the there here in small whom on the situation in ivory about with particularly by the most the my mr programmes the the this ensure on make
i am really the opinion that the here is to a example the how the not must
the forces have the government in the so help opponents and journalists are even persecuted and there is a constitution adopted with a racist nature
there is no the idly if we still not sufficient have learnt the the events in rwanda and the former yugoslavia
how can the however that everyone the now surprised shows that general  the elections to are hand has the
i think that the european union pleased must are that the new president laurent  a national  has sit
also should we welcome are with the elections the next month taken will be we must demands that this elections the transparent way will has and that not few political movement or candidate that will be excluded
the equality between the political groups must be guaranteed
to the reason must president  the possibility the presidential not out since the a logical result are the the elections
mr the president i am the opinion that we us  must show and must demands that this racist constitution illegality the declared also must we us to oppose against the unclear debate on the specific  
in this debate the because the national preference reveal itself we us in our own countries oppose and the a ethnic cleansing to result will have the  constitution must the any reference to the specific   terms be
i can i not in all ideas the the mr  find this applies in the particularly for are liberal and economic positions
my seat is the not for nothing the this on the the chamber i think the however unacceptable that the mr  the excluded to the few reason that are father and mother not the   are
also think i that the parties the outside the political stage are placed again their role must can play and full part must can take the this elections the ostracism the people as the mr  means that there a group the secondclass citizens the created that there two types citizens to and that discrimination to within the become
the european union must there further the ensure that not the the member with their former colonies links affects the only are based the economic interests or geostrategic considerations
as has the head the the french diplomatic service presented védrine let know that this elections in certainly respect legally are because they in agreement are with the constitution
if we the situation from that view look than had we also the apartheid must accept since the also in the constitution was anchored
i like even still further to and to the you i not forgive that we in this respect also close and good links had must maintain with the former yugoslavia the the at that milosevic there the constraint 
to finally like i say that dictatorships only can there the expense the the citizens the in poverty life and not access have to knowledge
our aid the the these countries must than also must to the democracy in this countries the to build the illiteracy with urgency to necessary to to and the poverty to combat
we can the citizens the this countries only help if we they hand the the build the the democracy
president the is seductive to the recent political events in ivory for to to if a victory the the democracy the the dictatorship if a repeat the the  but this time in the heart the africa
the is seductive but the is mistake because the reality is very what more and the position the the new president very what more controversial
that   not is managed in are model to through legally elections are power to legitimise is without more a good matter
the european union and also this parliament have this a important contribution to made by to demands that there democratic elections would to and by the  in to to
but that provided laurent  the the elections has won still not the necessary legitimacy
also he has because the nationalist card drawn
also he has the constitutional supported intended to are most adversary  from to decided the on the the fact that are parents not both  are
the law had to result that the traditional ethnic harmony in ivory serious was balance
people the foreign also and the the here however third to the half the the population are since the subject the discrimination and even the attacks
the law had also to result that the those the  especially muslims from the north the that country with success the elections have kosovan which the turnout not higher was than to little to the new president a credible mandate to give
when  those the streets  to new elections to demands was their protest with violence proreferendum
 in the capital were attacked
there were least deaths and injured
from fear for a war complex  the the the the result
the would not illogical are if the european union today new presidential would demands which this time all candidates would can participate
but i recognise that there a number reasons are to that not to do
the first would this the attempts undermine the the new president to the national unity and reconciliation to restore
in the framework of has he fact are opponents several traced offered and november designated to a day the national mourning
hand have all parties the now prepared declared to that to work the the restoration the the rule and the peace
this must into as some colleagues here already have said in the elections the december which  parties must can participate
i believe not that the the europe is to oil the the great to update and the tensions further the to flames if there under the involved apparently a willingness to reconciliation is
but the real test for  is there the december
we can there only the ensure that this free and peaceful elections be and hope that the new government the ivory the broad democratic basis has the need is to the ethnic harmony to restore and this country from the economic much to help
president best mr programmes compared with the other states in west and central is ivory in the past a redoubt the stability and democracy been however are there already long time ethnic and religious tensions and was there there the power by the former government under  
this has end led to a violent  by the army that the army however recently under difficult circumstances the the elections could be instrument clearly for the democratic determination the the population in ivory
i think that democracy and rule now again can be built
to wish i the current president success and also many 
the  the the elections have the approximately hundred people the life cost and that is course a heavy burden for the future the the new 
the is however a good sign for the democracy the rule and a national reconciliation that november is designated to day the reconciliation
the european union is asked and has the to also prepared declared to that to help the a peaceful honest free and clear way the the elections in december and the elections in january
we must here a eye in the important the and this process constructive hand
there will many that depend or the really is succeed to this cautious beginning the the democracy by to to
course must the constitution be amended so origin not reason to discrimination more can are
in many parts the africa have we to make with the coexistence the different ethnic and religious peoples
if here such narrow borders be drawn can that only but old crisis  and to difficulties lead
we know that there millions people in ivory life the from a the the neighbouring are
and than like i still not agree like the problems if child
also this people have right the a peaceful environment they must political responsibility in this country can to and they should not be excluded
therefore believe i that the resolution the like the the parliament represents to this a contribution to make and i hope that we the also success will have
mr the president course would the better are if the european parliament the dictatorial tendencies the robert  would condemn the mr  makes because the the presidential a typical should since he the most candidates has excluded the the race to the first what the ethnic violence has do matter
but as usually to the european countries their responsibility the the events from the way this applies in the particularly for france
why were the french authorities   still years support after are racist campaign the start was has against a important the origin  minority the third the the population the ivory is
why has the french government the  the  by the forgive given the european parliament like this fraud now later be condemn
why join the french government the view for the role the the current president  in the spread the the xenophobic moreover the this role also in the before resolution not the the denounce the
although the french government not like intervene doubt no remind that behind the perpetrated silence the the french free material interests underlying
to the enormous large interests the the french capitalist groups in ivory to protect has france the dictatorship the  and are hand decades supported
as approves france all lowest areas the are civil  in ivory because they the their on the french interests defend
people if   and  in ivory the fighting to the power to all responsibility for the has xenophobic and ethnic counter in this country
also france has here however a contribution the made
we condemn the ethnic violence and especially also the responsible politicians whose demagoguery to this situation has led
also want we the role the the army and the police the the murders the the denounce to
we want us however also from the the representatives the the political parties the the the africa the france involved were
we explain us solidarity with the hardworking peoples the ivory irrespective their origin the the disposal have know to the in all misery also already try their leaders them against other the to to
mr the president in various recent statements has the european union the excesses the the regime the general  the the denounce the they has also its displeasure expressed on the from exclusion the the elections the october the the most candidates the the opposition which the credibility the the process itself a long tomorrow has behind
the union has the attempt the general  to the result to confiscate with urge condemned they has also fierce criticism expressed the the subsequent violent repression by the army the the demonstrations the the those the laurent  and the cruelty mitrovica too which the citizens in the north the ivory the victims are become
according the commission is the in the current circumstances the essential important that the for december planned elections open and transparent are and i conduct this two adjectives
the next elections must ensure ensure that the the the presidential excluded political parties the national level be represented so the existing shortcomings somewhat be compensated
this elections must the cornerstone forms for the consequences and by us all pursued national reconciliation
the european community will the organisation the this elections finance and we will also a fraction observers send
after the elections and on the how this are has can possibly a indepth debate with the new authorities the ivory be opened to the conditions for the  the our cooperation the to to this the course not way that we must respond the 
we must with particularly aid to the the injured and the victims the the recent mitrovica conflicts to this end has echo already euro if emergency the available the
they have especially to make with health and education in rural if we want guarantee that the process open and democratic process must also this problems without be tackled

mr the president i am very pleased to see that there a  support is for this resolution which with strong very the military junta the burma the condemned
same am i also very disappointed on the fact that we again with a resolution on burma must to because the situation this but improves and in fact strong reductions
a number reasons is the basis the the need for this resolution
a the the most is the fact that the spdc  has the nld still for the end the this year to will destroy
there are signs the that point that we them in this intends seriously must take
their attempt to the nld the their current place to against does suspicion that they the a systematic way are are to that objective to achieve
the number political prisoners seems very recently has to are the to which many forced are to forced to out and subject be the cruelty torture
the meeting the next month between the eu and the asean in laos will place offers a crucial possibility to to let see that we this regime in as strong possible very condemn
we to the council and the commission the to the sitting the to suspend or the to say until the junta in burma all political prisoners deserve backs and aung san suu suu and already its members allow the free to they and until the junta the burma a sensible dialogue affects with the party the the elections has won the nld and with the ethnic minorities
aung san suu suu has itself said that the approach the constructive involvement the the asean with rangoon not working
the possibility to the sitting the next month in laos the to say and the to suspend offers us the opportunity the statement as strong possible on to to and a as clear possible signal the to give that we this illegal regime condemn
mr the president in the partsession the october by commissioner patten i if answer on burma that if the circumstances in burma  there again look had be or the  the planned the for and december the taken had be
how very must the affairs still worse
aung san suu suu must with no contact have
there are political prisoners the the population live under the poverty and the the children in burma is malnutrition
burma is after afghanistan currently programmes create second producer the heroine and opium
there the a large offensive held against the  and the  and there are as the un has pointed still not signs the that point that the dialogue between the  and the nld the the is has
while we here on burma talk meets today the  in geneva and the is very probably that this will be elected for sanctions against burma from protest against the use the forced i i understand that the french representative in geneva this way supports
the is now time to actually nevertheless conditions to to the this sitting in december
aung san suu suu must be released and must the freely can move
a troika must permission to to to burma to to and must this can to and are where they like and everyone the they like meet also simply can meet
today has also thailand that member is the the asean said that burma a permanent presence the the  in that country must to to let that there a mechanism must to that ensure the forced and that  for a country that günter is the the asean not must be lifted until there really results are achieved
how responding the eu the this strong noises from whole europe and even for the first from the region
the is certainly  if the commission and the council the the position continue that this sitting the the a or another way ahead can find
the will very certainly the this at be interpreted if a flexible the the european approach
aung san suu suu has there recently again the out that constructive involvement with rangoon not working and that they and the nld have asked to the sitting from to to
if the eu the sitting late place feels the junta the encouraged and encouraged this courage from the decision to our ministers the foreign affairs ministers the democratic elected european governments therefore together with the military junta the burma the a table to let are
we would us for this type treason must shame
the asean would also continue think that the not need is something to do the the inadmissible in their spectrum
to we here silence that agreement or take we the decision us back to draw
by faith to continue the our own principles and the values the we who who we same also the values the the population the burma the as systematically the persecuted by the military regime in its country
president there are several reasons why we here now fact again for the second time since the summer on burma speak and the is also not the first time this year that we the on this country have
this are several reasons
aung san  was recently again not permission to rangoon to leave and to to talk with its his the the nld the party the as therefore the elections uncertainty and still never the power has should exercise
james mawdsley the  on who we the two months ago have had is although since the time released
we think that this perhaps a small ray is but that must us not how the the large affairs the the large picture that we in burma to
end is the however as that the un for the human from burma is back with a negative report
the rights   is the a dismally way dealt
there is therefore all reason to again on burma to talk and unfortunately is there not the hope that the the last time is that we the on burma have
in the  the course extended on the slavery in burma talk
the is a subject that here still not as very many attention has had but course also in the context the the european union discussed must be
the political oppression is by and the refugees with particularly to thailand is by moreover with military commitment to thailand to
this is in any respect in the way which we international with other deal completely unacceptable
the military government in burma that the item and stability to can maintain in a country which ethnic rivalry to the other woods
but the oppression the the regime exercised strengthened only but the feelings the  the there can there and lead the not few way to a solution the possible ethnic conflicts
the problem is course what must we now do if european union
we say let we continue with sanctions
i think indeed that this not alternative for is
the sad is that sanctions to now to still not have work
but the constructive commitment the asean has that already nor and i i also the feeling that the other countries the neighbouring the burma still more in a position to which they the start to shame for the decision to burma to to let to asean
their philosophy the constructive commitment has not work and i think that we not must stop if european union to them this to point
with burma the one table to are working not
i i moreover also not confidence in our own ministers that they the affairs this the the item would to
the the kickstart in october have they the the not few way on human had
i i also now that confidence not therefore to we the this at still by the the footing the sanctions
we support the i the amendments the by mrs kinnock the that point are tabled
mr the president mr the commissioner the thursday when we the situation the the human in the world under the look take approach the atmosphere here in the parliament the picture that the moaning in i stated
the sad legacy the the colonialism and the guarantees have failed compulsory europe to the vigorous courageous and decisive way the to to the the restoration the the democracy in different parts the the world irrespective or the is to latin america where guatemala currently the head offers the the problem the the impunity the the military africa or in this case burma
as the already said is the a fact that the situation in burma reductions the is incomprehensible that a democratic leader the consultation if aung san suu suu still still the persecuted and that the league for democracy its functions not in normal circumstances can modified so the restoration the the democracy social
also can this country still always count the economic investment the precisely use make the the lack the freedom the the lack the rights there therefore are we the believe that the european union the international level the necessary determination the the day must to to by means the sanctions and the obligation to consultation to commit with the leaders the the democratic opposition the democracy and the huge exercise the the right the freedom the the burmese people to restore
there must urgent a end to the this situations the the  events from the past again in remind to therefore emphasise we again the important the the before resolution and the settled commitment the the commission and the council this
mr the president i speaking behalf mrs maijweggen the floor on this resolution afternoon have we already few excellent speeches heard
while we here  in this area with procedures are have the democratic elected members the burma arrest are they underground and situation they in especially
meantime the the communist junta the people the press and the nld in a iron over
members the same junta have said that they the nld still for the end the this year will destroy and such expressions hear we already years with the to the minorities
since september have we already two time resolutions adopted which we the regime in burma vote but already our clear and genuine views on this matter the sorry know we that the ministers the foreign affairs the the eu their  in laos next month will meet
we must loud and clear say that we the completely mistake find that they their plans a
we in europe must their not the  give what that affects have we excellent speeches heard the mrs lucas and mrs kinnock
we know all the story the aung san suu suu and we must us that aware are that the constructive involvement between the asean and rangoon not has work
therefore must we our governments call to not the opposite to to do the what the  and nobel us asked has to do
yesterday was i a was the the mr james mawdsley the from burma is released that i the you like read
are words are many  than the own if the is is the havoc the the burma regime the to show
he says the military junta in burma is date for the nld
they are afraid for everyone the the not wishes to issues the their atrocities
for them is the clear that the world and the nld under produced the dr aung san suu suu the not let issues
therefore feels the regime the must the nld in are whole to destroy
officials the the military secret service have i said that the nld must be physically
the nld must be destroyed
they  involved when they this said
the is crazy
they smile to the murder and suppress the the elected representatives the burma
the regime creates also the that they all karen will murder and they commit genocide under the ethnic population the burma the karen the  and the karen
i i by their areas got from the summit the the bergen to far if the view goes are all villages destroyed and is the population killed or from their homes terrorised
i i victims given the oppression  dying and dead women and men
the hatred the the regime against the ethnic groups and the nld can not in control be taken by to tire the reasonable or  behaviour
the regime responding only if the the threatened feels
my release is this the proof the
the late see that the regime only than something will do if the the threatened know
this are the words the james mawdsley not the own
he has been ago under burma hands and he says that they only something will do if they threatened be
that must we us good for view continue the in relationship to the kickstart
mr the president there depends already years a  the aung san suu suu the the wall the my office which to see is that they the sakharov the prize by this parliament
the  is at  and  become and  the the corners
i i him this let depend in the hope that i him would can replace by a  and more continue 
but as by the many excellent speeches the afternoon already is clear become rest us still always only but  regarding this fantastic  charming and very promptly women and its attempts to the  in its own country high to the
international given is its country a  become
the asean is both literally if figuratively a as tiger become because they mention has something to do the the appalling events in burma
a additional shortcoming the the on the the west has place the the departure the the special un for the human in burma the mr  
he left because he according own say almost not support was the the bureau for the human the the united nations
i know itself what a source the large concern this is for the commissioner mrs mary robinson
mr  has this said i see but little things change
each year again take the general sitting and the commission again resolutions the
i am disappointed
we are disappointed
we find that we despite the many feedback and involvement the this parliament there not in managed are ensure to ensure that the military junta responding the the concerns the the world
i think that there sanctions must to
the mr deva has the positions the my group explained where i full  and the is significant that there afternoon not a speaker is been the the not agree is with this ideas and with the overall support for aung san suu suu and its party
here in the parliament to we its already many years a hot heart to
the is had that they to the date still still a hostage is in its own house and the is hardly to contain what they the last years has must see
i know that the only a voting comfort is that we the the door the this cruelty and base regime continue  and i hope than also the very that the suggestions the are done by both the mr deva if mrs kinnock by the commission will be recognised and respected
with regret welcome also i the possibility to our concern regarding the renders human in burma to the to to and as many for i had i would given that the situation this was improve so we not time again the this subject need back to to
by this issue if a urgent priority to to hope i that this parliament a clear signal principle the the burma people that we their hardship position not are forget and that we recognise that the situation in burma earlier reductions than improves and that we determined are to there something the to do
i think however the that the international community the rhetoric must let see and on must to to real action if member the the delegation the this parliament for the relations with the member the the asean asia and the republic the korea am i just as many others disappointed and concerned that the eu has decided to the next month the ministerial level with the asean in laos to to talk
i know the arguments the the joining under the attention the our delegation have the with the to the inclusion the burma in this group
they believe that they by with burma the dialogue the to to this country the the a or another way can influence so the are oppressive practices will change because the the unequivocal economic and political benefits the the improve the the human will recognise
burma is already a number years member the the asean and there is to the the day the today not only proof that there only improvement will to or that there a end will to the forced executions or oppression the free expression and free movement
the list with rights by this regime the each year again longer and longer
a constructive cooperation with them is a ridiculous naïve concept as there not the least flexible in its drafting to there is
the only that this dialogue achieved is that the their regime the the burma junta the legitimacy
as i already earlier said we want not words but action
if we the lives the the burma population really see want improve than must we few the the next affairs do
as others for i have said we must the meeting the the next month in laos will place suspend the burma junta must all restrictive measures with the to the democratic elected political members and the leadership the the nld lift and the junta must the dialogue into with the nld and the ethnic nationalities
the finally must we consider the economic sanctions the the  to support to to prevent that burma benefit can achieve from trade with or investment and tourism from europe until is the that they the forced have abolished
if values have we the moral responsibility ensure to ensure that the population the burma same fundamental enjoys if the population the europe
mr the president the human in burma reductions still still under the  regime the the military junta
the however already difficult position the aung san suu suu the still 
they has not more should travel from the at that they arrest was and that was the september when they to  tried to travel
they has apparently not access to a telephone and must not visitors received
there to even rumours that they in its own house with  must are
the situation the the rest the the members the the nld is hardly better to mention
many are arrested or difficult cases and there are attempts done to their offices in burma to the
the junta has said that they the party if whole like destroy
but the is not only aung san suu suu not only the army not only the nld there are almost political prisoners the to suffering have under forced and torture
ethnic minorities must forced move and there is forced
the  is this been and has tried the situation to look to to see or the constructive involvement to only improvement has led
as we know is the  today in sitting meet
probably will their recommendation are that there sanctions must to because there not improvement is in
i beginning as gradually clean enough the this speech to to i i i now already three or four time with this words to the council and the commission at but the situation the still worse therefore what is you there now last agree the do
council and commission the is time for action
you must however admit that we not few progress make with the current approach
take the sanctions please in recital
give clearly to what that we the sitting in laos not will attend in presence the the burma military junta because that unacceptable would are and the junta than the message would to that they secondarily its the can to
vietnam
president i am welcome that we last vietnam the the agenda have
that has long took
i think that especially the colleague the mr dupuis the that point praised must be because otherwise had we perhaps still longer this must wait
what see we in vietnam
we see a country which the population pace while the the summit old men are the patterns to the that what they know
that is as tragic because vietnam is a country with so potential
the has a dynamic healthy and  population
the has natural resources as oil fish hevea rice and wood
you would say old gentlemen i the door open and the success will influx
in place of see we a completely lack the press and a connections political oppression
look but to the treatment the a  if hectares  
i know the that the discussion on vietnam historic sensitive is
we must least that was to now to the use careful are with what we on vietnam say
finally has the west this also a certain role played
the is historic sensitive and course is the situation difficult
we can with human not say is the glass half or is the half
the glass in vietnam is not are
that is where the to is we work with vietnam
the is a partner the us we should therefore not continue silent on the situation this
mr the president you would you can ask why the european parliament the as close concerns with vietnam
for some is vietnam however very far the the european union from
but i can you say that example for germany and bavaria vietnam very close is
if we from the bavarian border to the neighbouring czech their see we vietnamese markets and meet we many  the especially in the border active are
to we in the east the the reunified germany than find we  the the this in the framework the the communist block have located in the west again life  the now precisely for this communism are fled and if asylum or refugee to germany are has
this the the how there in this  since long time already there is the a close no
that that also very clear from the question in the history the europe and germany and also vietnam
germany and europe were shared
ten year ago were they in freedom reunited
vietnam has ago under terrible wars was torn by the interests the powers
this vietnam was the a day also reunited not peaceful but with  and the was reunited under a communist system under a dictatorship
now find there in vietnam certainly the economic reforms place
many people had the idea that this automatically also to political reforms would lead
but we see very clear in many asian states also in the just express burma this is because a similar situation that economic reforms trade and cooperation how we the also welcome not automatically lead to more freedom and a better rule
precisely in asia there the risk that economic and political reforms be fee that there progress and liberalisation in the economy is without liberalisation in the political and without strengthening the the rule although i the opinion am that without functioning rule the den duration also trade subsidies and investment lost to
therefore has also the economy a rule if framework need
therefore is the as important that we clearly the rule the lifting the the socalled reeducation and especially the freedom defend
in vietnam were this year a catholic  being and small afflicting peoples persecuted
there were missions closed and missionaries imprisoned and also the about church the rich is the traditions was the very cruelty way persecuted although precisely they a large contribution has made the the national extraordinary the vietnam
therefore is the our duty to the to to for this political prisoners and despite all justified economic interests clearly democracy and rule to demands
we should the the human not eye colluding but must say that we if the economic power the world with vietnam want work under the condition that the way the budget for democracy and rule and that last also started the with the political reform that long had must place
we will this looking the the freedom the  and the press
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues i think that the mr maaten a important point has touched while vietnam on all conditions has to a rich country to can be is the currently a the the poorest countries the this planet
the would one the the asian tigers can be which there the last years already so the are discovered fact is however as i just i indicated that vietnam one the the poorest countries the world is
the other problem is just excellent by the mr posselt expressed i had the itself not better can define
addition the issue the the human is there namely also the issue the the democracy since in vietnam any form the democracy there can the country the not from the economic stagnation from and is the not in the the corruption to combat the the country the the periphery the the imposed brings
the is therefore necessary that the european union a gather attitude towards vietnam favour and the issue the the law together with the issue the the human the the item the what the human the are there the last years few small improvements means
the are however not to thank the the mr sakellariou the are amendments behalf the socialist group has tabled the situation is perhaps not more poignant but still always far from the what vietnam currently would can up
the commission must consequently the issue the the democracy and that the the law central to in the relationship the the european union with vietnam its
i think therefore that the here to a important resolution is
two year ago have we for the last a resolution on vietnam adopted i believe not that the socialist group the when in the particularly for the resolution has accepted
the mr posselt will also effort have the something like to remind we have the resolution when adopted and can see that they to a number small improvements has led
i hope that we also the before resolution will adopt but than the without the amendments the the mr sakellariou further hope i that the commission strong commitments will do and that the vietnamese authorities specific the our ask will like
president i can largely agree with the argument the the previous speakers because many affairs the today the day in vietnam done are not acceptable
i i itself a time by this country travelled and the vitality beauty and large diversity the natural resources the this country learn know
i regret the therefore more to more that the not the courage take for more freedom and initiative that the government respectively the political leaders that prevent
however to answer to give the the mr dupuis regret i the that we us not in a joint resolution have can find this resolution had can must if response the the important and correct evidence the human rights watch a organisation the always strict case on the violation the human
if you now already less or more announce that you against this resolutions will vote than must i unfortunately notice that we us the the vote on this resolution probably will abstained
not because we principle against are but because we find that we this a common basis had must find
mr the president must i with your if a little abuse make the my time i like like attention questions for a case that not more in the list the topical issues could be included because the only recently know is become
in iran be namely in the with a process on a event the the   in berlin since the elections two people with the  threatened least the charges the the public prosecutor namely   and  
i would you mr the president want ask to the president the the parliament that to point that this a very could situation is
i like not directly favour for a intervention but we must this process however very carefully follow and if need also say that we in the general in all cases against the  are but in the particularly in cases which the is to a ideological crime
i would you only want ask to this matter with  to approach and i hope that you excuse that i my time on vietnam this i used
mr swoboda the european parliament is flexible and efficient
we have this directly note
if the is to the save the people are there not bureaucratic obstacles
we will you ask to us still the relevant data to was and than will we course respond
mr the president when i as many others the my generation year ago in my residence the streets  and the usa vietnam from called had i not thought that i a quarter century later forced would are to here in the sitting to are and the free vietnam to criticise for partly same type infringements the the human if which we the united states time veracity
unfortunately is the however not as that countries the itself are affected by violence oppression torture  and millions automatically a type  be the such acts not itself can out
israel is the a the the clearest examples in the history that the not as simple is
any nation must time the time learn what human and democracy are
now says human rights watch as the mr swoboda said however that vietnam the last time certain steps has taken to the situation the the area the the human to improve
thousands political prisoners are released
i think the reasonable that that the the in a resolution
the must hard criticism exercise but the must not cannot the what there despite everything happening
that weakened the criticism only but than to those the be criticised the feeling that the not role plays what they do if they not everything in one time do something what they want or can
criticism can a counterproductive effect have if the not repeat the what there actually happening
vietnam deserves hard criticism as the to find is in the resolution that there not doubt but i think the reasonable that we also only statements into which that that there certain improvements have place
president the is gratifying that with the today started jaime the president clinton the the united states the vietnam again a important step the the in the direction the a reconciliation with the past
the war between this two countries has not led to a permanent bitterness
however would the good are when the american president the in  not only would concentrate the the strengthening the the mutual cooperation but this precisely on would make the hard commitments the vietnam the changes miserable human in the country drastically to improve
because there is indeed many wrong in the communist vietnam
in unlike to the  amendment the the group like i the that human rights watch in a the november published document the human in vietnam the many points if serious as
see the political and religious prisoners partly  in reeducation
see also the ignore the the recommendations the the special un on the religious intolerance see the lack the free expression and the existing 
in the particularly like i now briefly on are the the serious  the this at
they are in recital e and paragraph the the common resolution than also rightly included
the recent celebrate the the asian magazine more mnet and economic review makes today report the the there the summit  from from vietnam
this extremely secret documents provide us a rare look behind the scenes the the policy the the vietnamese authorities
further research the this official as i i they itself read from that with particularly the reserves the addressed the persecution are
especially the reiteration rapid growth the the afflicting christianity under the  in programmes s mountain northwest provinces has  userfriendly and to cruelty sahrawi achieve
typical in this the is the promotion the a  for whose anger now hundreds christians the the flight are beaten
this  is the above asked after are severely now also the whole province the christians to particularly
the the the light has documents are nothing less than a  wish
they let see that  arrests and  not isolated actions are the seductive 
no this acts based the the political directives the the vietnamese communist party
here is the lie the the light
the vietnamese authorities demand because that they the last years freedom the religion has introduced
president clinton would there good the do this these days the the item to to in 
the council and the commission call i the to a  protest against this flagrant violations the the freedom the religion by the vietnamese authorities
mr the president i will both issues try to to explain
late i start with burma the persistent violations the the human by the burmese military regime are here already by my mr chris patten the the denounce the occasion without process  introduction the forced compulsory movement the local population imprison the hundreds political prisoners and  obstacle the the freedom the act the the political parties
the mr patten has also are concern expressed on the arrest and persecution the aung san suu suu and the members the the national league for democracy
the commission shares the concern the the gentlemen members on the situation in burma completely we already us support behind the here today concerns criticism the the way which the military regime all principles the the universal statement the the rights the the human the are flout comes
the recently in the united nations adopted resolution shows moreover that not only the union the ensure makes
the commission the however the the its conviction that the current situation only but can be resolved by a dialogue the to launch between the military regime the democratic elected opposition and the representatives the the ethnic minorities
the council general affairs has attempts taken to the military regime for the argument the the political dialogue to win and pressure from to exercise order changes the to force the council will are efforts continue
the commission supports this initiative
we are that convinced that we under not circumstances should allow that the situation in burma the dialogue between the european union and the asean hostage the
the last conference with our partners the the asean dates again the three year ago that is many to long especially because this region for the union from political and economic view particularly important is
therefore are we the believe that the conference better not the postponed
that means however not that we now or in december must do if the accession the burma to the asean not adverse consequences for our relations has had because the has they the had
the partners the the asean are the this aware the aware and they wish the caused damage to restore hand aware they also that they burma to must they everything in the work to to to a end to make the the disastrous situation the the human
they know that this the best way is to the relations between the union and the asean a new impetus to give this this mutual relations both for them if for us the essential important are hope we that they our concern on the military regime the us i by the majority the the involved countries the shared will continue transfer
i am the believe that the conference euasean must be as if a new opportunity to us position the regard the the situation in burma ready and clear divided to to not only the the regime itself but also the the members the the asean
we will pressure exercise the the military regime to the to force doubt and put to to the the violation the the human and a dialogue with the democratic elected opposition and the representatives the the ethnic minorities to open
on vietnam and the situation the the human there would i the next want say we should not forget that this country currently a period place
there they the reminded that the vietnamese government a process the the has the that in the economic and political level and the the area the the external relations to the adoption the a programme has led
since has vietnam a open external policy held hence that the now within our international relations such a important place its
also is the process in implemented in the signature the a cooperation between the commission and vietnam meantime has vietnam also considerable progress in the direction the the market made
result of is that the country a request to accession to the world has tabled addition has vietnam in the framework the the in adopted constitution on a elected national parliament that with the legislation responsible is and the government for its policy the responsibility can to
i believe that i that here today must emphasise we have from wellinformed source heard that the members the legislative closely into and the policy and the initiatives the the government  control
this progress and the context which vietnam progress remains make deserve our recognition
vietnam has already a long way made nevertheless is there indeed as here rightly is said still many work the the shop
also i concerned i ensure on the problems the here by different members to raised are the although there already almost people are released the on the general  is the worrying that there still still people  because their political or religious views
the am us that the the vietnamese press not official censorship upon but we to to our disappointment the that in the foreign press quite agree the cutting the the
the is also clear that the vietnamese authorities pressure exercise to the national press the a regime the  to issues
although the course a good matter is that the number the death banned crimes recently is down clearly the themselves that the death in our view fully must be abolished
the circumstances which beginning this year a canadian receptionist is  those us course in our conviction
the commission the together with the member part the all actions the the union the before the the vietnamese government the the area the the human within you can there moreover the the the that we in this process specific problems and specific cases will continue denouncing and the continuing improvement the the situation the the human in vietnam will achieve
mr the president i like like only a mistake the mr swoboda up
there is namely the a negotiations been and we are the agree become on a joint resolution
the three points the you here as has your group in the consultation at not presented otherwise had we this in any case wordings found which we perhaps had can agree
we were the fully agree on the text
you has later the amendments tabled what legitimate is apart the a wording the for us not acceptable is because the the appear has the into
this wanted i only still say to the procedure clear to make and on the content will during the vote be decided
mr posselt this was course not appeal the the rules but a content issue
now is the floor the the mr swoboda mr dupuis perhaps see you the the your time but the you the please very briefly
we know because where the to is
this are course points the in the by us tabled resolution are
in insofar are there the negotiations the the basis but from the vote will will where the journey across is
mr the president i like commissioner solbes questions or he us length can inform on the election the a democratic parliament in vietnam he has just during are speech because detailed on this revolutionary action about
i can i that however hardly proposals and my mr programmes probably also not
mr the commissioner the you that please that and please you as kind to the mr dupuis the appropriate way writing or oral to answers
the debate is closed
the vote take today to at place
floods in europe
the the item is the debate on the next motions
b the the members lambert others behalf the alliance
b the the members ford others behalf the group
b the the members deva others behalf the group
b the the members ainardi others behalf the left
on the floods in europe
mr the president in unlike to many others the afternoon will speak have the most the my electorate not terrible to suffering had the the floods in the united kingdom
london was there with what small floods from for a part the rivers which we the there not agree more knew because they by underground  are
we have however the the the causes the this floods contributed western has already longer time to make with the consequences the a series extreme and europe weather
this floods are this the another example the this is course but a voting comfort for them the the bout water by their homes see are and the perhaps with large financial damage be faced
i am the agree agree that we already the possible must do to them to help we would them however the most help by the situation the their misery and the the countless others in the whole world has caused to change
the local level can we put with the  the  and 
we can our systems change and we can strategic environmental introduce which we with the nature can work in place the to think that we its can curb
the world know we that us use the fossil fuels the lament from rice we have to now to not steps taken to the amount greenhouse the we produce back to insist
we have the the discussions the this and next week in den hague be taken the opportunity to the this area progress to make the agreements the there already are must we out
we must however also do what the treaty rules namely environmental let entitlements the all areas the policy and practice the the union the member must to also prepared are
we must in our economies the the the idea that cheap fossil fuels good are
we must for this fuels the full price pay and gradually move the a  economy
i can for one time agree with the words the the british prime this i see than also with tension from to are action
the eu has a tremendous opportunity to the this change to a ecological sustainable society the role to take in a such society will we not floods have the partly to due are the the fact that we the consequences the our own action not under view see
mr the president very europe has to suffering had the the recent high  and floods in the united kingdom ireland italy spain and france in the united kingdom were under other wales and yorkshire affected in ireland were the  and  and in italy liguria and 
homes but also energy transport and communications were destroyed
in my own environment the southwest the england had we with already this effects to make
the most railway between  and  is still still concluded
if result the the by the floods caused damage will that the next month as continue
the allow but a its or the city  was the the world concluded
two  the a the north the  and the a the west the  were few days blocked
the were the worst floods in the united kingdom since
in area reached the river the  its highest waterlevel since the  for the first were measured
 had to camps with floods the the whole coast
in  was the river the  as high that there a  in force had be the to the the possible consequences to can respond
we are the this at still still the  there is for decades millions pounds damage caused
i am the than also with mrs lambert agree that we measures must take to us share in the cause the the floods the to tackle we must measures take the the area the the planning planning the the area the the produce the new forests the all areas which we by our own activities the dangers the floods so greater have made than they were
we find also that the eu aid and assistance must offer not only in the southwest the the united kingdom but in all affected areas
the resolution asking the commission and the member to not time to lose and now directly their practical support to express by human and equipment available to to according the the december adopted fiveyear that provides in a community action the the area the the protection the citizens
also ask we the commission use to make the all existing funds erdf and the section guarantee the the eaggf
this time am i on a matter the reason is to large concern this subject is the large important for the european people if whole and also for the people in my own constituency southeast and with particularly for   know and the city 
i i the on the exceptional series floods all in europe
i am i if member the the commission development also very good aware the the recent floods in mozambique the subcontinent india bangladesh the  etc
when we to the list the countries and regions in the resolution look see we how serious this matter is become
in few eu are even deaths cases
the damage caused the small and mediumsized companies households farmers elderly private and especially the also the poorest and the most in our society the in the billions pounds
the is opinion i clear that here something very carefully wrong is
today the the the sixth  in den hague by the members about on the progress the the 
last monday proposed the dutch  jan pronk that the consequences the the climate for ecosystems the agriculture the water and the health irreversible are
how less we do and how longer we wait with the problem the the roots the to tackle more to more be the consequences and more to greater the attack the the  the people plants and animals
this is doubt where
the issues the be discussed concern the medium and long term
the tabled resolution is however on a very real  which many thousands people in britain and all in europe be faced this resolution the behave by the whole parliament with including the my colleagues from england
only already in britain the the damage estimated the approximately billion gbp only the half of the by the insurance covered
for very europe will this amount just if the  still considerably increase
the commission must the most possible almost make and its energy and financial resources working to to ensure that the victims in the most affected areas immediately be help they must this use make the instruments if the erdf and the section guarantee the the eaggf
we must especially also aid offer the our farmers small and mediumsized companies elderly and households the already different times with floods to make have had
for some the them is the still but the question or they still again a insurance can conclude and or the insurance this again will to cover
we must us also good achieve that the almost which we all in green and rural areas homes build dangerous and rather is
there were often good reasons why our their because the regular repeated floods not in this areas 
now are there however governments as the current labour the on this the experience based poverty knowledge across  and precisely in the areas to build
i know the situation in the rest the europe not exactly but in the southeast the england is this currently a real and clear present risk
we must us against this  almost oppose
we must the balance made and serious measures take to the emissions the  to to
we must us the effective and coordinated way prepare to ourselves to can protect
we must everything do what in us ability is to them the now already suffering under the terrible consequences the the again both here in europe if in the rest the the world to help
also question i addition the resolution the we have tabled that we here in this parliament the short term a public hearing on climate the i request the conference the presidents this in recital to take
i request you all our resolution to support
mr the president the recent floods have all in europe and with particularly in very britain and ireland large damage caused
in my own constituency are the cities   and  the most affected
the was heartbreaking to the destroyed homes the so people to see and to the problems the so villages companies and farmers affected the to hear
the is very to regret that we if european union not line have for aid the people the with this type problems to make to both i if others do already many years attempts to a such line the to to
i think the also very  that there so damage is caused the the economic areas which the european union considerable funds provided with particularly with the to the infrastructure
the the time that we here something the do
the eu must in cooperation with the governments the the member the initiative take to a programme the preventive measures the improvement the the infrastructure
this can prevent that there in the future the extreme weather again the as large scale damage be caused the problem is that we the know when this weather the arrival are but that no something seems to do to the worst damage to prevent
the other problem that i to the like to the the additional problems the the victims the this type tragedies also still will affected i objective the the the point that my mr the mr deva already mentioned namely the refusal the many insurance to  to extended
i question i the or we if union this insurance according the existing legislation not can force their in essence moral duties after to to in place the to do what they now do namely the interesting take from the responsibility fish and risky situations avoid
if we them however this not can force the the a matter where the governments the the member must help we must than look or the not possible is to under the umbrella the the eu the governments the the member to force the disguised cover to regulate
the is unreasonable to people the such enormous tragedies must witnessing then a very insecure future meet to let to the is because given the climate the now already intervene completely certainly that the problems the they the last few weeks have had the again will arise is the not next year than however certainly in the years then
mr the president gentlemen commissioner by the disaster the in the last weeks different areas the northern has occurring addition other european countries britain spain ireland and france see this parliament the again placed for a most problem one must there taken be for special aid the for the the in hardship circumstances crisisriven civil and for the been affected business and hand must there a  down be to to prevent that natural the a such extent again 
a few italian region programmes have the the very very to iran had and this is already the second time in less than a month
also time is the damage high behind there are victims cases and with particularly the material damage is enormous
especially in the region liguria are whole farms the ornamental vegetable and fruit destroyed also is there a enormous damage caused in  the infrastructure and companies in the industrial sector this not only by the disaster but also by the   the the sea
given the verging dimensions the this dam is the request that formulated the in this resolution the we together with the other groups have tabled completely rightly despite that still but briefly ago the october the this problem a debate in this house is devoted that reunited in a resolution
we questions that the commission under application the article member the the eu the struck immediately sufficient financial support much and that they in the general account the with the fact that a large part the the on areas the the set conditions meets to in eligible to to for the existing funds the regional fund the tell the life
the the contradiction high time that the union not enough with the out the special aid if as such disaster already has hit
europe must there the the member the insist that they their legislation improve the the level the environment to abuse in the industry against to to to reforestation to promote and a agriculture the not only at is the increase the the production but also the nature and protection the the on
the is for the hand that a action with a such scope not efficient can has if only the national level to work the has in the first place because there extremely many money the is look but also because this type natural just as climate the national exceed
with this resolution insist we than also not only the the a  to to help the damage to restore but also the a  that the europe a area makes that still safer and  for the citizens is
mr the president the members the here the floor have held have two different issues to raised the the first the problem the the climate and the second the question what measures the commission or the european union in the current circumstances can take the regard the the disastrous floods the the have occurred
what the first issue the like i emphasise that we just as the parliament particularly important attach the the problem the the climate and the conference the currently in den hague place
we have active the the preparation the this conference part and we have that the that the union in this the a leading role plays
we support a number the the statements the here are made we are the there under more on agree that we the this way contribute the the protection the the environment and the credibility the the  the in must be ratified
we are us that aware that the general destabilisation the the climate the result the the accumulation the greenhouse in the atmosphere in the future the most challenge for the energy in europe will forms
the energy and the transport will together the all greenhouse in the union produce
therefore must this moves greater efforts make to the  in to limit
since the expect that the transport will continue grow more than in the next ten year must especially the this area drastic measures be affected
given this will the commission soon two  present a whole the policies and actions which a answer will be formulated the the in kyoto commitments obligations and the objectives on transport and energy
in the first document will the enforcement the the elastic be dealt while the second text the will focus the the revision the the common transport
apart the the environmental like i however also any comment give the the steps the we in the current situation can take
you you the there perhaps the aware that we with a fundamental difficulty to camps have the legal the our actions
you know that there used a line for emergency the victims the  was
this line is since only time from the budget removed with the argument that the this issues the subsidiarity the application is and that they therefore not the community but the national level belong
this is the margin the the commission strong has
the commission has in this the two initiatives taken
the first is particularly clear and has to make with civil protection the september have we a proposal for a decision the the council tabled the strengthening the the community instruments for coordination the european level the the different civil 
this measure will although contribute the the solution the certain problems but offers not outcome for difficulties as the what the currently arise
this can we only use make the the already existing financial mechanisms
mrs ghilardotti has the possibility funds elsewhere money to seek
that is however not joke
you know better than who also that the financial resources exactly budget are and that we normally not the surpluses need count
the budget the only in exceptional cases not carried and even than can we difficult on this resources have because the legal this there
therefore the the commission for the existing funds the the eaggf and the structural the the interreg to use commissioner wallström has this proposal moreover length the the parliament explained
the problem is that the in this cases not is to by the commission in the framework the a general programme affected measures or the the model carefully amended or must we that take that the measures the request the the member the implement be the the the hand the specific programmes or actions from under the the mentioned funds
we are whole and already open for this type specific projects we have that used already said and i wish that here now to repeat there they however the out that the above proposals this essential are
to finally would i still any comment want give the the possibility to article member the the treaty if basis for community aid to use i believe that this interpretation the the article all limit to outside is
to still but to silent the the budgetary the the by would to the article is not on community aid but on the compatibility the national aid with the community
the damage the result the natural provides the in the possibility that both concepts compatible are
time when the commission the to the the a natural has must express on the allocation the national support has they this the light the green the
we are therefore the full prepared to also the this opportunity the necessary measures to take provided the existing legal framework and the current leeway be respected
you thank commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take today to at place
we interrupt now the sitting to the the votes to at
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
vote
the the item is the vote on topical urgent and particularly important issues
joint resolution on central
mr the president the result the the inclusion the a the the amendments is there a error in the joint resolution into
to this problem to overcome i i for the last part the paragraph and the the widening the are powers by the next sense to replace and supports the widening the are powers if instrument for the strengthening the the democracy
mr the president despite the by the mr salafranca proposed oral amendment use the socialist group its proposal to in two parts on this paragraph to vote
mr poos that was also my intention
report a the the mr rocard behalf the commission employment and social affairs on the supplementary insurance ini
mr the president this report is in the sense important that the on a complexes is the a considerably part the the public resources under this applies both for the different member if for the european union if whole
the is to minimum the the expenditure the any member
this report is further the important since the  the a number intends the the member the the union the the summit the lisbon have expressed
also the in this report that will in vote the the the european commission asked a green the to to that specific on this issue is
now must we to i just heard i with members on this very important text vote
the is perhaps in this parliament usual that there with as such small part the the members voted the but personally think i the quite embarrassing that we in the european parliament with as little members on such important issues decide and in the before case the commission a as important task entrust
i question i than also the or the parliament the vote on this report not better can postpone
mr the president from respect for the rapporteur think i that we the vote must postpone the mr rocard has the  because explicitly asked to postponement the the vote
i think that we from respect for the mr rocard and for the work that he has done the vote must from to to
president i i i very close with this issue been and part the many discussions both in the commission employment and social affairs if in the economic and monetary commission
in this parliament are we unanimously the opinion that we for a further political debate and specific measures very quickly the point the the commission want have developed and the the basis the the 
the vote postpone like say the task the the commission postpone
given our joint wish think i that not good idea and therefore request i the vote now to let place
mr the president since you already by your opportunities for points the item across you can what i now say probably not if such be as
if you i allow like i however however like something say what the position the this parliament in this issue also is i offends i the the fact that different colleagues from different groups and with different perhaps very good reasons us today constantly the right deprive to here the thursday late are the friday in strasbourg to vote
in are general about is this a very bad matter
i like all colleagues in all committees and groups the the dignity and the content the the work the this parliament in increasing extent try to undermine to caution should
applause
thank you the mr cox
i respect your comments and assure you that they in the minutes will be included
the parliament rejected the request to postponement
president the amendment like i in each case behalf rapporteur rocard like a oral amendment submit
i would want proposals and this is like with other political groups to the the end the this amendment to to add and with the support the eurostat
i i understand that this the the assent the the other groups can count
therefore add and with the support the eurostat
the parliament the the resolution the
explanations
mr the president night i i a dream had the i time is  and that is a  because normally forget i my dream immediately
i what that there a large number pensioners and  the days were the against i said look mr fatuzzo we have not can vote for your party the pensioners because we in the  are as you see
the is here best good oh hear but we wanted you there however the like the the the informed to that you tomorrow on a report will vote the  with a amendment that you mr fatuzzo you tabled in that amendment the the commission the asked a eye in the important to the to ensure to ensure that also elderly in eligible to for medical assistance
if this amendment earlier was adopted than were we there still been to the you to vote
the is i therefore a large pleased for the report to can vote
president from the  that very clear how important the is that the members also the thursday in the parliament present are because here time again just if the friday on important affairs the voted
therefore like i everyone thank the here today in the parliament is
health is a good and not commodity which competition the application can are
the commission pace there trivialisation the from and prepares now also the area for new regulations the the area the the health and the health the like they private insurance the possibility offer their activities from to extend and the difficulties to overcome which this companies the national and community level camps
they undermining because systematically the public  and with particularly the health the is a matter scandal that they private  see if a necessary supplement the or if a pseudochocolate the public systems
the economic and social policy the the eu that has led to a reduced purchasing and therefore to a reduced ability the workers to contribute to pay the turnout the new diseases and the without activities the the pharmaceutical industry have led to a considerable increase the the 
the result the the by the emu imposed budgetary and  can ranging not more whole be covered and therefore like the now with all measures this costs shift the the workers
the must the differences between the  the the member and any obstacles for the free movement the people and the right the free residence in a other member not opportunity to a large part and later perhaps even the whole the the health to privatisation
the final objective the this proposals is sectors to liberalisation the the crucial important are for the oligopoly capital through under more intensive concentration the the the oligopoly capital a large finger in the responsibility the the insurance and more in the general the the markets and the funds
us i must the to to strengthening the the public health and the public systems the must the understanding universal services real content give what means that the any citizens good health and quality market prevention must offer
the danish social in the european parliament vote for the  on the supplementary insurance
the report report the the the that a still greater part the the modernise in europe by supplementary insurance the covered
the is a serious problem if this means that the people the on the their economic ability or the their health different dealt be
during the debate in the commission employment and social affairs was the problem the the propose driven when our british conservative mr programmes  that the permits the a insurance based is the the risk for the insurance
as would a women the by  more opportunity has the  a higher premium must pay than other women
this is contrary with the fundamental principles the solidarity which the european social model based is the is therefore necessary that we a common initiative take and work that no the such supplementary insurance the excluded
michel rocard stressed in are report that modernise in first body a national matter is which the subsidiarity applies
when the european parliament the commission request a analysis to make the the policy in the member is the because we want that all citizens in the member can enjoy the a health the market quality
how better the health in the member is more to smaller is the need the supplementary insurance
this area is good in eligible for cooperation according the open method the european council has this method also for the fight the social exclusion recommended
we oppose us totally against this particularly hypocritical resolution the a risk is for the public systems in the union
as must any citizens a high extent the social protection to enjoy irrespective the resources which he has and the individual risk programmes which he the exposed also the in the considerations indicated what risk programmes a being the public systems to private systems and opposite with the of
there the therefore not an to a enlargement the the good reveal community public services under the pretext the savings and compliance the the subsidiarity like the the public service to to a order or minimum the if net must to act
there would than however still the must be the what ensure this net covers further the the door leaves paved for the private insurance
the only restrictions the their be imposed is that they their patients in the beginning not should selecting also must there the the the the reductions a distinction per  be made
this resolution has in fact only one objective namely the organise the the market for insurance in europe would however progress must be made in the development the collective and quality good  the for everyone accessible are
we have here again to make with a report the the commission employment and social affairs that although the problem the the supplementary insurance a very topical issue is in the commission and also in the plenary sitting the the european parliament not agreed is because there have however twelve members in the commission against voted
the is certainly a good and good request the the commission to a green in to must and the ways to mention to the current systems for  effective the to complement and in the to the by means the supplementary  basis the medical concern with market facilities the is also important that we the development the a internal market for supplementary  welcome
in the particularly however like i emphasise that the report rightly concluded that all other aspects the the health not matter are the the european union but the the member and that with public resources financed  the exclusive competence the the member continue
since this the case is seems the i very premature to a long very detailed  for a proposal for a directive the the commission in this decision the to take
i think the a little strange that the the commission now already like pin the a proposal for a directive but the commission same request to a green on the the the affairs with the to the voluntary and supplementary 
effort we here not the horse behind the plunge
with this comments and reserved i i however for the report voted
insurance and pension properly a part to are the the salary that people with their work deserve
supplementary regulations are only need if the real supply deficiencies
they are a source the profits for banks and insurance the the money to the to  that the people them by reduction the contributions and taxes
in place the the insurance to see if a part the the pay for work or the a benefits the labour replaces makes the the supply still more on the saving and invest
collective and solidarity would must disappear so everything individual can be resolved
any the must to only still solidarity to are with itself and the are to to the with all superfluous 
who not many money receive and spends counts not more that
as the under more a divide in the health
who simply assured is is the the  and in the  rightly while who additional pays the the right buy the priority and luxury
the surprised i that rapporteur rocard the i from a far past still know if leader the a  party now pleased is on the development the a internal market for private health
the rest the what he proposed is the link the the crisis the by this choice be caused
i approve i the i behind this report the my socialist mr michel rocard on the future financing the the systems for insurance
in a time which there is the a dramatic ageing the the population is the the crucial important that we look how we the systems for health in very europe can improve
we should the important the a cooking by the the and the mutual agreements between countries not underestimate
when i recently itself ill was in belgium i i from the first hand the benefits the a mutual recognition the the systems for health should perceived
say from my own experience like i there the i for favour that we this benefits in the the
we questions the commission to the different national  to look and to ensure that there good agreements to for people the temporary in a another those work
this national facilities are often literally the vital
if we however a effective system want have that the increasing pressure the the national services can processing and that lead to a healthier europe for are citizens must we however also the important the supplementary insurance recognise
we must citizens the the private want assure not against
the health the our citizens is a extremely costly good
all in the eu must the citizens can count the effective health independent the the country which they the are
i request the commission the report the michel rocard the i to take
this are the explanations concludes
own ability the credit continuation
president gentlemen mr programmes i am particularly pleased that i today can speak in presence the a group visitors from my constituency the i than also you welcome is
we to the debate continue on the report the mr villiers the i like congratulate with its report because the its is managed the different opinions within the commission to unite
for i means this report therefore really a step to the
the important is especially that there in the commission a broad support was for this important plans which also sufficient account the taken with the needs the small structures as  cooperative banks and the central and small there is all many the the that the socalled internal rating therefore the internal assessment the  programmes same position the if the external rating what because planned was by the  committee
i believe that this a considerable progress is
for the public debate is the there to my opinion also to clear to make that not the  committee that because not elected body is on the final directives certainly but the european parliament and the council in the codecision
the the public debate in the country i i namely time again the that the the always has on the  committee
in reality however the the european parliament together with the council a decision on the final legal regulation and the awareness this must we increase
for i rice now however the question according what procedure
the banking request us urgent this in a up procedure to decide
also i am the opinion that the parliament to must contribute and if possible already in the first reading a final decision the
we must there however the for ensure that the rights the the european parliament the not few way be  but that the the a or other way so possible guaranteed is that the parliament and the council the already in the first reading on the drafting the than the down agree can be
applause
president best mr programmes to to start like i something say on my group in the economic and monetary commission was because the the actual vote not flagrant majority
the the part the my group has least against voted and we have there also for taken that the report not during the last plenary sitting was adopted but to today is postponing
i like however expressly say that this nothing to make has with the actual content the the report but with what mr von wogau just the there has the if we us would made the the further procedure were we afraid that the parliament distance would do the are rights
this can we course not help
in the commission itself was agreement on the actual subject
also the rapporteur has there really for taken has there effort for done to agreement to achieve
we want agreement on this issue
we would there also good the do to in the parliament on this issue a as broad possible consensus to achieve
the the hands having revision the the  for credit and  has farreaching consequences for the banking and outside
this requirements have large influence the the to the loans by the institutions
if we see how the european economy the mainly supports the mediumsized companies is appropriate the financing by appropriations the quickly clear that the the this project is to a plan the large extent for the economic policy
that was especially from the very close pursued debate on external rating
the point the the  committee to the classification the the  future mainly the to vote the the  the external institutions lead international to those
especially for mediumsized companies would this disadvantages with the would
to such abuses to avoid is the the large important that the institutions use can make the a simple alternative point for the the the the requirements that is based the the use the internal rating
the is a success to mention that the position the europe as the from the the by the commission in its consultative is proposed the in basle has centre and that now with particularly the discussed on account the with  
given the current the the affairs seems the principle recognition the internal rating both in basle if the us a fact to are therefore is the especially the important to such procedures such to organise that in principle all credit within the european union the possibility to to internal rating the all areas to to apply
only as can same competition be created
the institutions must than however the enough time to to the the the new rules for to prepare
according the last  seems the as to are that the new regulation the originally the january the force would be now to is postponing
the institutions would than more time have to this rules to achieve
we must ensure ensure the give i mr von wogau right that we this as parallel possible work
especially with the to the upset should there not already to large differences the between basle and us because that would for the involved institutions only by to with inadequate burden with additional costs or with disadvantages
a thing must however clear are the our rights if parliament in the codecision can and will we not culture
that like say if the us manage to together with the council and with the  influence the the commission in the first reading agreement to achieve than will we that like do but we will there not the advance already the culture
the is the the council
the council is to now to still who been the taken has for delays in procedures
he must agree what more be and ensure ensure that we this here smooth can deal
the the parliament has that still never the and that will also now not the case are
therefore gentlemen ladies and gentlemen the the council almost you the a little in this matter
mr the president there are very good arguments to the the implementation the the results the the revision the the  committee on the  the  quickly to act
in unlike to ourselves will the americans their legislation directly and without basic can introduce they will than also cheaper loans can offer than the european banks
also has the parliament with this very much  on  over the time had to the on this issue to inform
in fact the we here a first reading before the proposals also but are tabled
some in this parliament find this a disastrous terms the the powers the the parliament
we are the this not that agree
the delegate the powers with the to technical affairs is essential if we want that our legislation equal increase the with the innovations the the financial markets course must we the implementation the this  powers the still good continue control
we are here to our powers to use in the important the european companies and the our electorate if we that not good do will they us that not forgive
if we star continue insist that the parliament the any assessment the a technical subject must be involved will that mean that our legislation the the at the introduction already overtaken is
the introduction the a  costs two to three year while the release the new financial services with consequences for  as  only few weeks in up the
i i a appeal the all colleagues and especially the the socialist group to their positions on this issue to review and after to to what guarantees they in the basic included want see so we powers can delegate
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes general taken can the content the the report the mrs villiers difficult in doubt be drawn
we are other the surprised on the there the this text and on the new initiative the the commission
in the text the aim the european legislation on the own resources the the banks the the current situation the to apply
the own resources must to be between the the nature and informed the the risk programmes the this banks into
in the report the reference made the a growing consensus on the fact that the current legislation inadequate is with the view the the developments the the the last year in the financial sector have occurred
in the report the about on a growing consensus from can i how that there in fact therefore not consensus on this issue there
we must us than also ask or the used method and the elected at the relevant are i me namely the feeling that the parliament the in follow the the commission compulsory feels to are work to let corresponding with the the the  committee that moreover on not few legitimacy has to are positions the the member the to to
gentlemen mr programmes i like you in remind to that only eight member in this committee represented are also misanthropic in this committee representatives the the the competitors the the european countries
let we there than but for the ease the take that the opposed the judge not has  that the texts the the commission and the rapporteur a answer can offer the this real and still sociopolitical problem and that this corresponding the our work with the the the  committee the possibility the is offers to item the affairs to to
take you the than not contradictory that we our behind the the free america want up by the european banks more rules the to to and that we the recommendation the the large banks want into in binding provisions for the credit the the european union
the rapporteur take the probably business to simple legislation to demands for a already complex situation the only but more the the commission spoke already on a need and mrs villiers was the obviously need to there a account comes to do by this issue also still agree the a urgency nature to for
they has because a enough favour taken for a up procedure to this measures the to take we must than also see that the rapporteur itself recognises that we with this new legislation not few grip will to the the competition practices the unfortunately often in the united states prevent
under such circumstances will a initiative the this nature earlier a does effect have we to our  because additional rules the without that the banks only compensation in the prospect the the
despite the  the us parliament can the commission the not few way guarantee that the american authorities the banks the the european union not longer discriminatory
gentlemen mr programmes the report is nevertheless the a number points merit the offers a number real progress in compared to the first text the basle and the text the the commission
mrs villiers paying special attention the the ensure the the smes that in important extent the  on is the rapporteur request the commission the approach way to the internal rating central to to the the up the the new rules so the costs the  not will increase
this parliament has the she in majority behind a principle supported which we never want from the group union for a europe the national states will therefore with pleased its voice for your report produce
we are behind your work but want us the sceptical regard on a procedure the in our view a new stage juncture the a process
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes the is good that a as large part the the argument in this important report is followed
i can mrs villiers this only but congratulate because they the is managed as the mr von wogau already has said account to the with the different  and  in europe and a good report the to to
we say yes against more guidance the capital the  programmes the the economic  and yes against a further development the the 
we say yes against more account the with techniques for  and yes against enlargement the the suited the the  committee
the  committee address the mainly the large banks and external rating in the framework the smallscale banks and guidance the clients the was need to this point from to extend to internal rating
in this the is the certainly also positive that internal certainties within a bank if  be given
this is also important because the fact that a reduction to the external rating the loans for the central and small many more would have made
in the central and small be however the most new jobs created and existing retain
the merit the this report is that the the the clear makes between the costs the loans the create the employment the support the the central and small and the recognition the internal rating addition the external
we will than also the i for the report vote
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes also i like to to start mr  villiers congratulate
they is there the excellent way in managed to all sections the the parliament in its report to unite
i like briefly like the the problem that we in basle a framework create for systems the not without more compatible are we have different systems in the united states and europe and we must ensure ensure that a the area not the buried
in basle look the in first body to the large banks
we in europe must however to the small banks look
this find we the clients with little liquidity
we know that the large banks the not more are interested
we must there course for careful that there for the banks by higher requirements still a second affected the
of would than as we time again say the mediumsized the suffer are although we time again demands that the mediumsized the promoted
on internal and external rating is just about
i like this still the  add
we must that ensure that the informed the the risk and not only abstract the loan the assessed that there therefore the small loans for mediumsized and sector a certain manoeuvre remains there within the decisionmaking
i think the important to clear to make that the procedure in basle undemocratic is the european parliament is the only democratic legitimacy organisation the  in europe are position rules
the this procedure must we there not on give or we rights give but how detailed we now a framework the and certain  pass the other institutions as the commission but also basle
i request also the european central bank and the commission to there in basle very good the to ensure that this account the taken with the european structures
we must today the day if european parliament also clear make that we if our established structures risk are this not will accept than will also the large banks with a legal in europe problems to
what we need have is enough flexibility the this area
mr the president in the first place wish i the pleased the the commission from to speak on the fact that the report the mrs villiers the not limited to the assessment the the directive on own ability but also account the with the current revision the the changes the the regulations on 
the am us also that the before report a enormous contribution the the process in are whole is
the existing  be positive received both the document the the european commission if the text the the  committee for banking which i further would want like
i understand that the powers the the  committee for banking not with the the the european parliament can be compared the has because not on legislative competence
there do the however few important circumstances for the we not from the view should lose as one the  committee to the group the ten and although the not legislative nature has the the by the committee following legislation applied in countries and used by many international organisations including the world the monetary fund and course also third countries
therefore should we us in not case taking the the what there in basle happening although we a own legislative procedure have
we must own rules the the us allow if union influence the the decisionmaking in basle from to exercise
this said having like i emphasise that also the economic operators i i satisfied are with the point the the s on capital the the  issues strengthen
the commission take the a good matter that the earlier mentioned approach the the consultation function the the commission in the report broad support enjoys
the report is largely together with the ideas the the commission and the by us pursued objectives
the commission will there closely the continue ensure that also the potential most vulnerable sectors in eligible be taken
the report has rightly view for the possible adverse consequences example for the sector the the central and small and with particularly for our sector and our predominant their competitiveness within the european union and the regard the the other countries the the world must not be weakened
as we all know has the mr  the this issue a very clear and particularly useful report devoted that us to i believe can help to a more and complexities legislation the to to the to as to say better is adapted the the quickly changing market
we must the head offer the a reality the us to compulsory to guarantee that the new directives not already overtaken are the the at that they be adopted and the rules the the existing directives the force continue despite the rapid development the the financial markets
the lack the adaptability and flexibility brings the competitiveness the our financial sector in the way
i like here the first that say that our legislation  and sufficient flexible must are to the the quickly changing market in to play
the second must we avoid that the measures excessive costs would for the financial institutions and therefore indirectly also for their clients
we must the mentioned objectives support the the hand the good reasonable rules the not adverse consequences have and the position the our markets and our institutions not in risk to
there is still a another important point that i here like emphasise we are us there the full the aware that we the in the treaty legislation institutional balance must respect
the is a little premature to now already a formally position the the commission this to formulate but we can perhaps the already a number ingredients the the future approach defining
the is very probably that the approach the the commission the the three different levels will users
a first level would the principles include the socalled codes  the in certain rules example directives would be together
the a second earlier technical level would especially account be taken with the aspects the the strong changes subject are
the intention of is the legislation the to vote the the best practices the relevant rules would in annexes the the mentioned directives can be included
also would we a appropriate system must  to the quickly changes to can make
to far the second  the third level would the have the the development the mechanisms the promotion the the coordination and harmonisation the the measures and the strengthening the the role the the for the member and the commission is play
us i is the way which the current institutional balance the left the cornerstone the the process
the parliament must the guarantee have that the principles the the the decisionmaking the basis are in the future be respect by a agreement on this the hands having  the must also the security have that this principles that like say what by the parliament the certainly essential are and not town have but very specific issues deal
this are few introductory observations on how we within the current legislation the the treaty a quickly be and efficient process to the can to
i hope that the parliament the next months active the the debates will participate
now would i just want back the the issues the the specific amendments the will be made and in the report are included i i the two comments
the first like i you there in the with the amendments and the attention that the reference to the use the internal rating the responsible and sensible way must be included
there are perhaps many institutions the not with this approach might are this use must therefore in not case a obligation content
the commission has the from the the worked for the development the a broad the internal rating based approach the subject is the certain standards which good illthoughtout institutions smoothly can meet independent the their extent or the sector what they properly
we wish than also that this positive development by so possible institutions the adopted hand see we in that the not desirable is all financial institutions to force a the internal rating based approach to apply
what amendment on the system the strengthened monitoring the like i emphasise that the sadec now already the competence have a greater volume than the minimum requirements the to to or the to to
the proposal to this instrument only if a type the last resort to use would favour do the the impact the the  if element the the system
therefore are we the believe that the current situation maintained must continue
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
functions ombudsman
the the item is the report a the mrs   behalf the commission constitutional affairs on the amendment the the decision the the parliament taken the march on the general conditions the the exercise the the his the the european ombudsman
mr the president we are here today meet to to debate on the first the two reports on the amendment the the statute the the european ombudsman and the general conditions for the exercise the are his
my me that i in the temptation am the to the the end the the afternoon and the the end the the sitting if source the inspiration for this debate the care to take
good as see we both in the relationship with children if in obstacle and in the growth the institutions the the from other institutions develop that there a time is to to act from recognition for independence
and now is the at indeed has to to recognise that the institute european ombudsman sufficient is developed and adult enough is to a own budget to can manage
in a first stage had the ombudsman although full independence what the the exercise the the the him  powers but was he same on the the financial resources the the budget the the european parliament now is that changed
what we here proposals is now precisely a confirmation the this being the regulation the the council the december which the create the a individual section for the budget the the ombudsman in the general budget the the communities is approved
that is therefore a very important step been which the ombudsman for the application the the financial rules equal was the a institution this step was not more than the observation the the actual situation
the ombudsman is in the life established with if objective the citizens the the community institutions to involve if institution was the ombudsman still profile and therefore must he also financial independent are to as itself responsibility to to for the budget for the material and human resources the he need has to are hinges task to properly to can exercise
therefore must the statute the the financial rules adapted to be and to we for to article and article the the decision the the parliament the to delete the are as know the statute and the general conditions for the exercise the the his the the european ombudsman approved
the rules are not more in agreement with the real budget after the last amendment the the financial rules the the communities
what us therefore still rest is to confirm that the link with the reality there and good to approve that the articles be removed
since we us soon in this parliament must the on essential changes the the statute the the european ombudsman will we against the time move to the qualitative and full revision the the statute the this at is this still a discussion way in the commission constitutional affairs
the you i to mr the president to before to end the this opportunity use to make to the mr jacob söderman ombudsman welcome to whatever like like i him congratulate with are work in the fight against mismanagement and also with the promote the a greater involvement the the european citizens the the community institutions
mr the president i hope that the rapporteur the i not forgive the if i say that this a rather unclear report is and that we the quite late the the thursday discuss the is time also a report that the heart the the democracy in the european union affects because the is on the question how we the rights the the european citizens protect
there is not doubt on possible that the position the the ombudsman the the crucial important is
the ombudsman has in the framework the the european institutions a clear role and position the is however a role the independence requires
as we all know must the to really independent to can are financial independent are
a know saying reads who pays rules
they the the costs the activities and organisations pay exercise in the general about also only influence the the activities and organisations from
therefore must the ombudsman financial independent and as independent possible are we can there than if parliament not the be accused that we are believe determine
the public must the most possible confidence have that the ombudsman the are into fully impartial is
myself i there course just if all members the this parliament the fully confidence in that the mr jacob söderman are tasks completely independent effect this must however also for everyone clear visible are
therefore is financial independence absolutely necessary
the is perhaps also useful to the european citizens that to point that the his the ombudsman not he personally approximately million euro per year costs on the whole european union taken is that less than one  per person
for my english weight is that approximately a half  per year this is good spent money
thanks the initiative the the president the the commission petitions the mr gemelli are the right legal measures taken to the in by the european parliament taken decision on the tasks and powers the the ombudsman to change
if result of has the commission petitions in the resolution álvarez said that the procedure for the amendment the the statute the the european ombudsman must be given in the light the article the the treaty the the european communities
we should never forget that the role the the ombudsman anchored is in the european treaties
the group the the european party and european democrats supports the position the the commission constitutional affairs that the powers the the ombudsman must be extended and the how earlier how better this applies especially for the  the the ombudsman as the are down in article the the decision the
the quality the the activities the the ombudsman to now to has taken shows that the institute ombudsman still important the if full and necessary instrument for the european citizens to complaints on mismanagement by the european institutions in to must
my group salutes the support the the ombudsman for the commission petitions the commission the responsible is for the relations between the ombudsman and the parliament
the group the the european party and european democrats encourages the ombudsman in this respect the are work by means the are special reports continue to to we are always prepared this reports to discuss in a positive spirit the cooperation with the ombudsman
i hope that this parliament very quickly will decisions the  the the ombudsman from to extend
if that happening expect the commission petitions by the commission constitutional affairs fully and carefully to be blundered
as said are we the commission the responsible is for the relations with the ombudsman we work than also closely with him together
the group the the european party and european democrats supports this report than also we hope that the together with the report on the report the the ombudsman on the recruitment a sign is the the continuing commitment the the european parliament for greater transparency and accountability
we are not to wait the more work and also not the examples the mismanagement the is however important that we the european citizens remind remind that the function the ombudsman there is to them to help when the problems the mismanagement arise
many people regulation us the wrongly the lack the democratic level
the function the ombudsman bears certainly the the the improvement the this democratic level
mr the president the is positive that the european parliament accordance the scandinavian administrative tradition the whole time has the that the position the the ombudsman both had be strengthened if confirmed
the european ombudsman must fully independent are the the role the are obligations when he or they the this at is the jacob söderman a man and a good representative the the  get associate for the rights the the citizens when there there is the bad administration
only the the way can the function the ombudsman also the eu answer the its important and fundamental objectives
we swedish christian welcome than also loud the steps to the now taken will be to the independence the the ombudsman to promote even the as fundamental areas if the budget
this is important for the credibility the the independence and the independence the the ombudsman
we the the parliamentary commission constitutional affairs have course also our full support given the this positive measure
i like rapporteur   thank say for its commitment the this important area
the conclude like i still a other topical issue the the item to the the important is for the exercise the the his the the ombudsman
the is to the right to without reduction access to to to documents a right where only rarely use the the made
that right is a condition for a large credibility the the function the the ombudsman the the citizens
a ombudsman is course bound by  but the is good for the citizens to to know that he or they if ombudsman access can to to documents what they itself if citizens not access have
the is also the important to to aware that the right the the ombudsman the documents nothing to make has with the topical  that is a leaves products misunderstanding
the european parliament the parliamentary committees and as hope we also the commission and the council will a further development and strengthening see the the his the the ombudsman and the the independence and the the the credibility the that his
mr the president the commission not on this issue not long from to expand
the only objective the the report is that the statute the the european ombudsman the adapted the the amendment the the financial rules as the rapporteur already said there this amendment in the institution the a separate section for the ombudsman in the general budget the the european union
the commission has already in the past declared that they with this decision support agreement is not only from technical  but also because they the independence the the function the ombudsman like work
therefore enjoy the by mrs   proposed changes the the statute the the ombudsman our unconditional support
you thank mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
special report the the european ombudsman on the recruitment the the commission
the the item is the report a the the mr bösch behalf the commission petitions on a special report the the european ombudsman the the european parliament to the the the  on secrecy the the recruitment the the commission c cos
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes i believe that this report which we evening discuss very good with the the agenda the today because we have afternoon already a important report on the access to documents adopted and i believe that what we now discuss and which we tomorrow will vote the many to make has
in the past are there the the ombudsman on who we the just have had various complaints received on the lack the transparency the  that is a very critical point because we the fully agree are with the believe the the ombudsman that a  for many young citizens the the union often the first contact with european institutions is
therefore is the important that this things the as transparent understandable and clear possible remain
point the this report was this allotted the recommendation the the ombudsman the the commission to the the by its organised comparative into authors access in their own   to give
this recommendation has the previous commission despite repeated ask not followed
that was the reason for the special report the the ombudsman which he are request again has stressed
the commission prodi has meantime committed that they the the its specific fourth recommendation will out and the a allow research authors access in their own   will give
our commission the commission petitions has the this been and this report adopted
if commission petitions have we the the principle decision taken to the recommendation the the ombudsman the to take and we want also the commission for its positive response the the proposal the the ombudsman you thank and its this congratulate
further is the wish expressed that all other european bodies and institutions the example the the commission follow and the authors access in their own   give
we believe that this form the transparent and open access the authors for positions in the european institutions also a important step will are in the already announced reform the the european commission
this will we a document the this brussels and europe closer the the citizens to and more make
still a short comment on the amendments the tomorrow be dealt
they follow in large lines the recommendation the the commission legal affairs and internal market has done and they must apparently a little precise formulate what we fact in this the the the commission expect
i think that the especially the important is that we the commission that the also in this amendments a sensible term give for the achieve the this announced reforms and i hope that is my position if rapporteur that this also enough support in the parliament to find will are
mr the president say if member the the commission legal affairs and also behalf my own group am also i particularly welcome with this report
i am today behalf our been mrs hautala the here evening not present can are
the is with particularly its position which i here evening in my speech attention question
we are particularly pleased on the report the the ombudsman
we welcome especially also the reforms and changes to the to our conviction if result the this report must and if the commission that like also will be implemented
access to documentation is however because a fundamental citizens and not only document is for a candidate important than the documents the the have the examination
the core the the report the the ombudsman is that candidates the recruitment for posts the the community the right have to if they therefore ask their own   in to see
we want also in the particularly attention questions for a aspect the the languages
the is very difficult people to assess in a other than the own language
i i that itself a number times must do if   the the english or in each case a type english had i than  in the italian or german look
the difficulties be the resolved with a translation but we must there than the certainly the are that such translation the excellent quality is and that candidates can control that what they in the original language have list same is if what in the for the research used text the
if there differences are must the candidate the possibility have to this to point
we are welcome that the commission this is ensure
not only the commission but also the other institutions and bodies the the community must the recommendations the the ombudsman accept even in already happen recruitment
we regret that the commission only has committed the recommendations the the ombudsman to will apply the recruitment the after june are begun
we find that the community institutions the their comparative into and the all other recruitment the most possible openness and transparency in eight must take to any suspicion the  dishonesty and mismanagement to avoid
we must also ensure that the procedures as are designed that the appointment the women with particularly in the levels with including the the highest which they now underrepresented are the promoted
also want we the attention draw the the temporary and support functions the the institutions bodies and agencies the the community and the union
this must be published in the journal in the press and the internet to a really feeling the public competition to guarantee
managers must ensure that merit the rewarded and that all unfilled posts also the highest in the journal and the internet be published
further must people the working are in the  the members the the commission before they a unfilled postal elsewhere within the on institution can fill part to take the a public procedure
we mention if example the former chef the the mr prodi the to a other function within the hierarchy the the commission is staff
we hope that he will recognise that he as the mandate the the current commission end will must resignation he has because never the any public allow research did
there the all in the union often they that the very difficult is to there a jobs to to unless the the right point has
we must there everything the do to to ensure that this assertion not only wrong is but that the also for everyone visible is that he wrong is
mr the president the mr bösch has a excellent report up which we him many thank owe are same applies for mrs hautala the the commission legal affairs and internal market
we must moreover everyone to congratulate the the for this issue has used
this applies with particularly for the initiative the the ombudsman are to to transparency and are particularly large attention for the relations between the citizens and the european institutions
also is my thank from to the european commission the after only reluctance has decided closely with the ombudsman together to work and the his ask to meet this applies in the particularly for the recommendation the the this report the basis has the
we find the legitimate that a candidate access the in are   the access to documents is because a right that is included in the charter the the fundamental that we this week have adopted
also find we the completely rightly that the candidate after the mentioned the questions the the test that must take
the  must transparent are so any form the abuse prevent can be that may clear are
however think we that we with only flexibility with the rules must deal
since institutions if the commission and the court the justice many the other differences should the rules the for already this institutions apply not to star are
i think also that we some processes not must make with rules the not only high costs with the would but which also disagreement can the
i objective here the a amendment which example the the that level proof must be made that a oral examination has place
our group is very met with the vote the within the commission petitions has place
the rapporteur has in the plenary sitting new amendments proposed
we have they examined and can there three the accept the in agreement are with the text the we within the commission have approved
the other amendments are in our view difficult to achieve or even somewhat inappropriate
to finally like i say that we pleased are that the european commission the recommendations the the ombudsman can support
from the dialogue between the ombudsman and the commission can we how that within the commission the like there to a transparent policy and a good management to to
this like has a positive influence the the rapprochement between the european institutions and its citizens and confirms the presented way the usefulness and the efficiency the the ombudsman itself
mr the president the european ombudsman was with the treaty the maastricht set while same the understanding citizenship the the union in use was taken
the ombudsman defends the interests the the citizens direction the administration
ombudsman jacob söderman the the accordance are task in for the citizens and a conditions the good administration in the union
we know all that this still many the done must be
the the own make the a good open and effective administration is extremely important for the european union to more support and confidence the the citizens to to
this time deal we the report the the ombudsman on the secrecy around the recruitment the the commission
the report contains recommendations the the commission already is to follow
the rapporteur the the commission petitions from bösch says in the explanatory the are report that the principles the led have to the recommendations the the ombudsman same are if the principles the the european parliament namely standardised openness and the like confidence to give
as must the also are
the parliament is a directly by the citizens elected body
the is are task to behalf the citizens except the legislation also the community bureaucracy to control
the parliament and the ombudsman have therefore same task
in the report the the commission petitions the that the commission the before special report accept they as in the particularly the point which the the impression the the citizens the the comparative into the the institutions to like improve
the most proposal the ombudsman söderman has the the the right the candidates later their  testing in to see
the commission petitions says that the commission the ombudsman has committed the recommendation on from beginning july the to follow
in the report be also all institutions and bodies the the european community called the the next recruitment the candidates if they this to questions to to are their  testing in to see
mr bösch presented here already briefly the amendments the the the report are tabled
i hope that the in the plenary sitting be supported
mr the president if the european union in the future still something like proposals has they the support need the its citizens this the they only if the people confidence have in the union and its institutions
as the affairs there now stand be the institutions but already to often perceived if  and bureaucratic this has negative consequences for the parliament as example that from the low turnout the the recent elections
participation the comparative into for posts the the european union is for many their first direct experience with the european institutions
if there also but somewhat doubts are on the honesty the this into must the than also very seriously be taken
the fact that in the media this into in the are the with suspicions the irregularities and way has considerable damage caused the the picture that the public on the institutions has
the is for good functioning institutions course essential to good staff to have this achieve we only if the  without and as objectively possible is
transparency in the procedure with respect the the independence the the should is the the crucial important
the allow that candidates their own   recognise is a simple means to the transparency and the confidence in the  for european officials to increase
we welcome the initiative and the recommendations the the ombudsman than also the i to just if the decision the the commission to this the to follow
its example must as the commission petitions has recommended be optimism by all other institutions and bodies
the is for the construction and the administration the a multinationals society if the eu the vital important that there completely not suspicion there the difference in treatment or the national or the other grounds between candidates for posts within the european official apparatus
i thank than also the ombudsman for are report and support the the i
i thank also the commission for the fact that they the recommendations the the ombudsman is follow and the future recruitment candidates access will give to their  
i call all other institutions the this example to follow
mr the president the members the the list bonino are favour behind the report the the mr bösch and since there time not there is the ideological prejudice the often thousand are for the attitude the other members the the socialist group towards us adopt would i the group want thank for the amendments the they has tabled
the are extremely clear concise and business amendments the than also the were reform defied that like say the only reform the this name worth is and the the european institutions would must accept for their recruitment
however between the hinges words and hinges principles the the european ombudsman position and the  practice are the affairs not always as briefly and strong
after i the commission two questions had the on the way which the last internal examination is organised and the dealt i i precise and detailed answers received
from this answers was that there clear there was the mismanagement to but not to say the power by the general director personnel in the second answer the my question was commissioner kinnock the the responsibility this involved
with the view this i i a complaint tabled the the european ombudsman in are answer decided the ombudsman to not research in to to because the on examination already in a advanced stage was
unfortunately had and i i not the  assets the need are to the to the already to know what events there place to find
this not only in article member the the decision the the european parliament on the statute and the general conditions for exercise the the his the european ombudsman the that the complaint must be tabled within a term the two year after the date which the facts which the complaint is based the knowledge be the the the up
for far the my function and political responsibility affects is this decision the the ombudsman a  defence the the commission but a and another is not line with the mandate that ombudsman söderman the this parliament has capitals
mr the president must i before i beginning the recommendation do that the if the however are is with the  immediately all black advocate white or a other colour 
i like start with the mr bösch to congratulate with are excellent report i congratulate also the european ombudsman with the work that he does
already was the for my time i know that there in the parliament only concern was on the question or we the a ombudsman had have the seemed than because or there there was the conflicting interests
the history from that this not the case is and that a ombudsman many work opposition to the interests the our electorate to protect he is a port become where justified complaints can be tabled and where the investigated what there mistake is has
i had the privilege in the  or  member to are the the parliamentary committee to the work the the ombudsman this was a very powerful commission
we could everyone in the country the this commission the the his to we can the the procedure the this parliamentary commission used and which i as directly something more will tell many learn
the citizens the the european union must if they with the community institutions in contact to a positive impression to
the question is to they the also
i fear that the answer briefly and strong no is
according this report are there obviously improvements in the concerned
i congratulate the commission with its decision to the four recommendations in the special report the the ombudsman on to take
access to official documents for the citizens the the union is a important accompany the a responsible and good functioning democracy
the fact that authors to posts the community institutions their   should recognise shows the that the institutions confidence have in the implementation the their duly and case
the is a accompany the a democracy the in itself believe when the processes according what comparative into has public are and that the the the not syndrome behind confidentiality and secrecy
in the parliamentary investigative the the  or  had we the competence to solving the any level therefore not only the government to control this was not only the the way why we sometimes the commission control namely by them here to let to to questions to answer but also during two at accept meetings with certain ministers together with are or its officials
during this meetings could elected members the the parliament questions to also very detailed questions and were they also detailed answers the their questions this start the process the openness the administration and the transparency
in our resolution speak we on transparent administration this must we in the european parliament in practice to to
mr the president also i like the rapporteur and the rapporteur for opinion the the commission legal affairs the i thank for their work my congratulate to however in first body from to the mr söderman
he is who which the european citizens with their many complaints on mismanagement during the  the the commission register and he favour are function the excellent way he has a report up to a solution for this issue to find
the is course a good matter that the commission many recommendations the the ombudsman has adopted but i i remains there still a gap on
the commission refuses because a comprehensive system the principles and guidelines the to to which they absolute objectivity can guarantee the comparative into and recruitment
a such framework is however the only way to a end to make the arbitrary and the the the arising complaints justified or also not justified complaints that know we not on comparative into the on card are
technical problems how large this also should are can not obstacle forms for the political objective the transparency
the president the the commission itself has us repeatedly assured that transparency in the management the the european affairs for him a priority the the height is is
i i was he the the at that he that said very good what difficulties the achieve the this objective in the way were
i like to finally still say that the commission the duty has the to comply the the recommendations the the european ombudsman also must they a fully system the established to which they objective  can guarantee and the to two reasons
the first has they the on the the in amsterdam amended article the the treaty the legal duty to ensure for transparency
therefore invite we the council from with the commission together to work for the discussing the the this necessary regulation
the second is a such system a fundamental condition for the strengthening the its own credibility the european commission can in unlike to the national states not aspect the a long history
therefore must they precisely ensure ensure that the citizens the its something otherwise something news can expect something news is in this case the implementation the best practices and the avoid the everything what but its credibility in the member itself can weaken
the european union must more than the states demonstrate that they credible is the states have on other links with the citizens example links the common origin while the european union only but the expected can give that the european citizens the respect that is its link with the citizens
mr the president to to start thank i the mr bösch for are report that by the commission moreover positive the received
with some the are ask is already a beginning made
the candidates should example the  take the general  be the request the the candidates informed the list the the successful candidates the in the journal public and the composition the the should published in the journal the general comparative into and the the website the the commission the internal or limited comparative into
the commission seeks as objectively possible to are in this the would i any comment want give the a number in the debate discussed issues
the first be the by the commission organised comparative into still anonymously corrected
the know not who the candidates are they be not identified the the hand the their name but with through the a secret code
my second comment has the the the language the examination be corrected in the national languages they be not first in a other language into
we try with other words maximum safety and security to guarantee so the examination for everyone as fair and acceptable possible would are
there is a specific point that here today in the debate on the report the the mr bösch special interest has were namely the access the the candidates to their  
president prodi has this issue used already touched
the this at can i this something confirm that also in the paper on the reform the the commission the with particularly in action on the guarantee the transparency for candidates the order text reads if follows finally must the commission as recommended by the european ombudsman candidates access give in the corrections the the experiments the all comparative into the after july be organised
some under you questions the the why this measure only from july the force the
precisely because we just as you concerned are to the transparency and the clarity the the procedure
even the to the access to the  examination is a issue the from administrative view only preparation requires how is the bound in are work who is to responsible how must this type procedures be as and the who must they be presented
the commission its in this respect its full cooperation and we hope that the mentioned measures the from the the systematically will be applied
course can the commission only for itself offer are
in the other cases depends the the the institutions the or they prepared are the in this report or in the petitions the the ombudsman mentioned procedures the to take
you thank commissioner
that was a very satisfactory conclude the a very satisfactory debate
mr the president i like not question to the is clear that commissioner solbes here not responsible for is but i i notices taken the the statement that the  from july accessible will are
still but few months ago was president prodi that all examination with commit the july fully open would are
what means this now all
that the famous reform with two year 
no mr turco the can only two things mean or i i i the the read the the text mistaken i order course the year or has the system my words wrong into
the is here course to july
mr the president i i a point the item
in are speech an the mr deva the attention the the fact that we in this parliament not very numbers are in the art the the investigate
this was night during the time with the council still agree very clear
despite the fact that the sitting early was last was this time to my feeling not more than a exercise in  
the fact that we if members only one supplementary question should to bears here certainly the the
the gives absolutely not the impression the a confrontation
i i for that the bureau the the any time going on the question or a member whose first supplementary question to a half minute limited remains not still a second question must to
this is not the right at to a such proposal to discuss you can however perhaps a letter write the the vicepresident the responsible is for reforms to to look or we the the the a or other way can introduce
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to at closed
approval the the minutes the the previous sitting
the minutes the the sitting the yesterday are distributed
not any
mr the president in the minutes the yesterday the that we morning the my request would back to the vote on the  from to to
this is this the right at
i had asked to this report in vote to to during the partsession the november in brussels since the a number sensitive amendments contains that in my view not must be adopted the basis the the majority the today chance in the parliament present is
we will your request will discuss
currently is the approval the the minutes the the item
the minutes be approved
vote
i will my request again explain mr the president yesterday i i asked to postponement the the vote on the report the mrs villiers
the is here because to a very important report that only in vote must to be the if the chamber are is
i regret the moreover that many mr programmes not the the friday here in strasbourg present are but good that is now once as if we today on this report vote are we the risk that the result based will are the the majority the here today chance for this report can be found what also us parliament not to honour will serve
accordance the procedure must the mr programmes the on this proposal from to speak
we will now a speaker for and a speaker against this proposal the the floor let
mr the president i would like my support express the the proposal the the mr goebbels
i late the the the parliament on
the is the you to to decide or you the report you postpone or not
the fridays in strasbourg are difficult for us but given the sensitive nature the the report the the issues the the item on the overall procedure the the parliament and our overall relationship to the commission seems the i appropriate that the groups the opportunity have to vote on to to when there more members present are
i think the unfortunately that there morning not more members present are
i would this not questions if i not the opinion was that the here to a important report is which the presence the more members requires is since we important decisions must take
i know that fridays sensitive are therefore late i the the the parliament on
personally would i you however want economic to vote for postponement the the vote on this report
we have to the explanatory the our rapporteur listened now like i like a speaker for and a speaker against this request the floor give
mr the president i am in the political has because i same people with arguments to can convince and the time to time vote to win
one the the ways to vote to win is to before when you opponents present are
if they are prevented if result the a inevitable  the breach can the the democracy than is the a other matter but if they not the effort want take to to to than are they the vote worthy
the is not the parliament that this introduction their right right to to vote but the are the introduction itself the not are published
mr the president this is a rights
mr villiers has this also not with our group like
i am the although with its agree that the to a important report is but also on a important report can the friday be voted
we will still but a time the friday meet in december
i was against the delete the the meetings the friday
but good that must everyone itself of
as we here in strasbourg however the friday meet is the also a full working
applause
i request the whole group including mr villiers against  to the second plenary sitting the november to vote
on is not with my group like
that is also not precisely
i like therefore proposals now immediately to to vote
applause
mr poettering we had already a speaker against this request had before i you the floor by was i not that you this position in would take
like no the for this request to postponement the the vote express
than put i the now in vote
the parliament rejected the request to postponement the the vote
the parliament the the resolution the
report a the mrs   behalf the commission constitutional affairs on the amendment the the decision the the european parliament the march on the statute the the european ombudsman and the general conditions for the exercise the are his
the parliament the the resolution the
report a the the mr bösch behalf the commission petitions on the special report the the european ombudsman the the european parliament to the the the  on secrecy the the recruitment the the commission c cos
the parliament the the resolution the
explanations  a
mr the president unfortunately am i late now i i not voted and therefore think i that i not the right i a vote the to to
your conscience and your respect for the plenary sitting serve you to honour gentlemen mr
i declare that i for the report the mrs villiers i voted that doing on the own ability the credit the was namely high time that directive eec which the issue eleven year ago regulated is updated and supplemented was
the is completely rightly that the criteria has adopted to to to to more caution but there are also other aspects the the issue the against the light taken must be with particularly the ratio that is a  per type party what a approach the the the  that in the assets the a bank decided is
in italy is this currently down the for  the the where  both per incalculable if outside the balance
where we the absolutely not that agree are is that the monitoring body the  d italia under certain conditions a higher minimum can the
the is not the the rules during the match to change that must ex done
we to therefore agreement with a higher  example but the must the in all cases and circumstances a the percentage are
hence that paragraph d the article the the  which this aspect the there is abolished must be just as all regulations in the member the changes later allow removed must be
the the assessment the the directive on the own resources the credit must several with other repeating interests carefully be balanced
the those have right the protection the their interests and conciliation is necessary to a fair regulation to find
in the first place would savers benefit have the a harmonised regulation for the whole eu because their savings the the the hand the same criteria against lose be protected
the the other on afraid the central and small that the by this regulation difficult credit will can to because the not same guarantees can offer if large companies
that would to a loss the jobs in this sector can lead
the call to a longer period caused a second alignment one be as many possible banks and with particularly the smaller this in the opportunity the to the necessary new regulations in their governing to into
hand is a delay the the transposition positive for the american banks the the the current regulation can benefit and european banks from the market can prices
a such penalising the our companies must be avoid without that the force the large european companies the detriment the smaller companies the used
we support the demand that there a solution the found for the conflict between the usa and the eu that from the discriminatory  result
already with already is the wish to harmonisation in europe rightly because harmonisation to more security and honesty for all involved lead
the must a on however not the expense the the other be allowed
provisional up the the european police 
the the item is the report a the the mr posselt behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the portuguese republic with the view the the adoption the a decision the the council on the provisional up the the european police  c cns
mr the president we have the today on important and less important reports had
i think that this a important report is and i am than also proud and fortunately that the the a friday the dealt and in vote the the because friday is a ordinary working
i think that we there if european parliament also proud the should are that we the idea the a european police to the have the
you know that the idea in the a sitting the police to  in  is born and that the parliament the in in the framework the a report on the enlargement and internal safety unanimously has adopted
the was when to a important issue the still given the namely that we the countries not only economic the the accession must prepare there must especially the the macroeconomic with the to democracy the rule and the public administration are met
the reading the the last reports can we the that the with the transposition the the legislation many better is but that the application the the legislation in the countries still difficulties will
the is after a dictatorship the decades years because a enormous task a new police and justice apparatus and a new public prosecutor the to build
this countries have the own force the way to the democracy found after they decades  are been we have time in us report the wish expressed that this again police be trained the really european and democratic standards not only accept but this if partners also determine
as is the idea the a european police for the member the the european union and the countries the
that idea the the parliament is then by the summit the tampere adopted i am the council very grateful that he this project that by our institution is however to the his has made
my thank is however especially from to commissioner vitorino the the vigorous for the up the the european police commitment the is also the portuguese government been the the commissioner course rather after the the this the initiative has taken and this our thank deserves
both the council if the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs the the parliament want that the european police next year already implemented the in the form the a network between the national  that common things imports a common leadership has and common training 
we want however that this only a first step is and that there the last within two or three year a real police the up
i like in this the a fine judgement the the french presidency quote that has said that we a real common police need have to a  with a european nature to develop
precisely with the view the the protection the the borders and the fight against the organised crime but also to the protection the the human in the european union the level to the is such common training urgent necessary
 and professional support this idea massive
they know that many cities in the border between the eu and the countries example in the east the bavaria already for such police fight
i think however that the still to early is to on a decision to take
course would that area the best location are
 is the there however to that the police there really is all political favour work this that
i like the bavarian and the german ministers the home affairs and the former minister the home affairs the austria  thank because they that time in tampere together possible have made
i think that this a unique opportunity is to europe the a specific way form to give by to let see that us  nature not only the paper there but also in the ordinary life to expression the the
we should there if european parliament proud the are that this idea and this initiative the us from are and that this idea already on a few months reality the
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes i like first the rapporteur our mr the mr posselt congratulate with the excellent work that he has done in the framework the this initiative to the provisional up the a european police
the is a subject which he the already long time very consistent commitment
we have here to make with a extremely useful instrument the this way can we not only the cooperation between the member improve but also the between the member and the countries for accession and norway and iceland
this type police is the fundamental important if we the european citizens in the european area for freedom safety and justice also really a high extent the safety want offer the portuguese presidency intended with this initiative result to give the the conclusions the tampere with the model to the also the in the scoreboard established deadlines to respect
the intention was to a network the to to which the already existing national institutions the all member together would be that would than the first step are in the direction the a european police and the would we the quality the the training the high police increase
we start now with the training the a next generation police this must in a european framework can function they must therefore prepared be the the application the community and the implementation the common actions
also will the this way the awareness with the international instruments increase to finally hope we the cooperation and coordination between the academy and other multinationals european institutions for the training the  to improve
we are us that aware that the in this stage free simple will are a consensus to achieve
the transition to the next stage that like say the institutional and physical stages the the future european police will however the the necessary problems call
we know that there still still member are the the up the the academy only support if this limited remains to a permanent network the national institutions we hope however that a majority this proposal accept if a transitional the us in the must to within not more than three year a so institution the to build
this proposal the by the commission supported and the is by commissioner antónio vitorino much defended
also the rapporteur defends this position that also the position the the european party is the rapporteur is even still something further
he the for the abovementioned mentioned term to reduce to two year if the possible is also as the intended objectives to achieve than is the in everyone important that we deadlines for the achieve the european area for freedom safety and justice adapt
mr the president i like commissioner vitorino the i thank for are presence here the the debate on this two reports the the commission freedoms the i i very important are
what the report the the mr posselt the the mr posselt has indeed excellent work done is the a fact that justice and police two new sectors are for the european union each proposal this is than also a step forward
in the conclusions the tampere the expressly referred to the need the a european police
the commission freedoms has i i with its amendments the proposal the the portuguese presidency enriched we are example the opinion that the training the police not only limited must continue to crossborder police and crime
include must also policy the as human services the citizens use the new technology  practices for enforcement prevention the crime and respect the the rule also must knowledge the the political economic and social developments in the european union the a place can find
the already this areas can the police or this now the form the the a network the coordination the the national institutes or the a from academy with a fixed posted a important role role the the promotion the best practices and modern 
course must priority be granted the the countries which the european union negotiations the
enlargement the the european union means enlargement the the area which free movement the citizens place therefore must this enlargement by to with supplementary safety and measures for peaceful society between the member
the countries should not delay up the their inclusion in the third pillar in the pillar justice and home affairs
therefore must a specific framework be up for the cooperation the the european police with the police the this countries
i like further still stress that the european parliament here only a advisory role plays
the creating the new european structures will certainly a impact have the the life the the citizens especially this we us now also to deal with 
therefore like i the council invite the i i today present is the by us tabled amendments carefully to look and seriously account to the with us opinion
president mr the commissioner colleagues i hope as the previous speakers that this initiative not if the another european construction the examined but that the this initiative serious the and therefore also sufficient opportunities will offer
i i only what reservations with the to the foreseeable
the floor police does i think the a american  on police that quite the the  working
hand think i the floor academy to little  when the on  is
that is course but a detail
i think that the important is to us to the essence to to
the social situation in the most member the the european union is now once the this nature that there indeed large need is the crossborder cooperation between the different police
the crossborder cooperation can only to results lead if the a number conditions the met if the the the concern paying the appropriate targeted programmes for craftsmen if the attention has for the training on the response the the member the crisis in third countries and if the the professional way exchanges and  possible makes with the emphasis the the professional aspect
special attention must also spent be the the training the european level on prevention the maintain the the public item and a efficient surveillance
hand must a european police the forum to be for the obtain the insight and the defend the the knowledge the the various national 
short i hope that without giving will be given the this initiative that i i and also according my group up the the need to a european  to the to to
mr the president if i something learnt i on regional problems since i in the parliament am elected than is the the that the articles and the the european treaty for the rights the the human all in europe very different be interpreted the right the timelimited foday before the  and a rapid procedures the the legal procedure and the right to pending the legal procedure in freedom to be the when the legal procedure not in short time can be completed
in the different region programmes the the union be this rights very different explained
i am from from a country where the legal permitted duration the the foday maximum days is
a person the days in foday is been without to are tried must in freedom be the and must never more for the on fact be persecuted
i i noted that the circumstances in the homes the today in france and portugal strong differences
people can in pending the their process very long time be held
within europe have we the this important point not the a uniform policy
this the in directly the with our 
have we a culture which people as briefly in foday be taken if need is the evidence as quickly possible the completed and the legal procedure the up or have we a system which people do what their the best arrive
when we within europe a uniform the good practices based  can develop would that a good matter are
but as i in a debate earlier this week i said there the risk that we a type overall should develop and take the the smallest in place the the the lowest lowest
we must guarantee that if we a police up the point of will are that within our  the human and the rights better must be respect as in the report the the mr posselt the stressed
efficiency the police means really not arbitrary people the the streets them and they in the  bear
the is is the people the to encourage the actually crimes commit and them the proper way to before which the police and the legal bodies good the other with
when we a police can up which this can be achieved or when we a beginning can make with this based common practices than would that a good matter are
the previous speakers seem there in majority from to to that the the crucial important is to the academy to draw the one few location
i see the need in the one few seat for the administration but i would the members the the parliament want ask seriously in recital to take or the the for the common community  better is to everyone the to lead the one few location or that the the prefer deserves to the training each year or per issue the a other police in a other region the the union to organise
in the last case to people the differences in the local views and the regional approaches appreciate
we hope that our police the den duration actually good practices the other will learn and not bad practices
if we the succeed than would we a police have which we if europeans proud can are
i hope that this excellent proposal and this excellent report this will lead
mr the president there is in principle nothing the to see the the idea to a european police the to up or the academy now only virtual there or somewhere a fixed seat has
the question is however what the academy is do what objectives and tasks they the i will the a only point like
the mr posselt writing that the academy the basis the common standards training for national police must speaking
but this start the problems already because what common standards are that
mr posselt you know that the policemen in the german federal fully under the powers the the länder is
if you the  the the länder agree with other compare than will you see that in brandenburg causes if the highest commandment the the working the police applies while this not in the berlin  the
in the  law is further the obligation included that police in active service their name the their uniform must to so someone the the a demonstration by the police the attacked the name the the nonnational can read and know who the done has
if you common standards you must you the therefore first define otherwise can the training the completely different ways be key
if the there other only to is the various areas experience from to exchange than is this really not separate academy for need
you has the on the enforcement the the public item
in item this i i not effort that
the question is only again with what resources
also the question the in the  the the länder fully different answered
what rate you include
you as in your report also the commitment the the police the the surveillance
now question i you
the us in other countries is that otherwise are the surveillance which a separately force there and  very clear the other separate
if you that writing can i that not support as not result what common activities there be planned and what standards there exactly apply
i must you honest say that i even the  not can accept as that not clear is
mr the president this is a film the we already given have and the us when also already not 
this is the another provisional but not temporary decision the usual exerting that the parliament the the council who the
just as europol is  from the  as will eurojust and perhaps also the the european prosecutor the justice constitutionalising from the judicial 
the is therefore the certainly that a light and currently almost  institution if the european police a another official construction generating if red the the policy now in the genes the the european union hot is
the is for the hand and the is even a open door to to that the organised crime the the international level swiftly only but tackled can be with crossborder policy just as the course is that the national police trained must be to the crime the cultural legal and linguistic problems the can resulting from one the european integration and hand the integration the the criminal organisations better the head to offer
this means in our view however not that the need is a new organisation in the life to to
the objectives the the argument to the creating the a police to justify and that are objectives where we behind are be many better and the more efficient way achieved if the the current national  is encourage to  exchanges  programmes and  to develop which the vacuum the there really is loophole can be
this everything does nothing the the the fact that mr posselt to us feeling excellent work done has
the position the the socialist mr programmes is us other a escapes
mr karamanou has just the european parliament congratulate because the a advisory role the but still but very briefly ago has the socialist group against voted to ensure to ensure that in the council the administration the europol members with vote could to
thanks however the work the mr posselt the last regulated that the the training the  also people and  be involved also is the suggestion to a virtual police the to to the the opportunities the internet know from to outside very good the only
general about remains the european union think work and the organise with same criteria if the what the the beginning the the century applied were in place the that they the new economy use to the a new policy the  and organisation the to measure
we vote for the amendments but against the legislative
mr the president according the decision the the council to up the the european police has this  to objective the to to the the training the high officials the the  with execution powers
i like that point that the rapporteur the indication officials the the  with execution powers like replace by police what probably a good idea is
what i however also from was that this training at is the the support and develop the a european approach the the area the crime and protection the the home safety
the rapporteur would this like  services innovation and surveillance want add also like the rapporteur home safety replace by home safety in the sense the the enforcement the the public item
my objection against this wordings is that i not exactly know what the european approach the enforcement the the public item etc actually means
this the or in the decision the the council or in the report the the rapporteur hypotheses
the only what i there from purely british point on can say is that agree intended the that the practices the the european mainland in very europe compulsory must be and that our own police a work interest the the day must to to for  car programmes   for  and   the they the their extremely given can depend
apart of is the surprising to read that there all that if a european approach the the area the the crime there
i am there the the convinced that the majority the the british population shocked will respond the the idea that the home safety a area is which only interference the the european union possible is
the british will as possible still more shocked are if they know that the european police the according the european parliament must to deal with the training the police and  that like say duties and excise order them for to prepare the the application the the community and the transposition the joint and community measures in national right
and this is the truth from the lending community and joint and community measures
the is clear where the european union to objective a joint approach the european approach the the area the crime and home safety
i am that convinced that the european union many subtle to work will to than here the suggested
our police will its own uniforms should the with including the the   
the levels will same continue as the local 
all decision characteristics will unamended continue but with the skilfully  the the european academy will the agenda gradually change in a european agenda the provides in application the the community and joint and community measures
this situation seems in almost nothing more the the common market what the united kingdom in 
in the time would no a  have wolf the warned that nonnational  from the   or  green ever still the  an the  would no and would study how the european execution approach had be implemented in british prisons
but here are we now in a almost know parliament in strasbourg that witness is the the almost less
our own prime tony blair are minister the foreign affairs robin and other british ministers should than the deny that there a superstate in the concerned is but if i knowledge take the proposals for the training the our own police order the european approach the the area the crime and home safety in practice to to than is that a sign the the mandatory
as you perhaps you understand will i this report not support
mr the president in response the the previous speaker like i say that i in the almost year that i member am the this parliament never something on the common market i heard
if the previous speaker the forefathers looking the a number the the then members the are own member the united kingdom than will he see that this extreme socialists were the with their the contravention bordering attitude the the european union as approximately everything foresaw where he now afraid for is
since i am to a other colour the the political spectrum is the interesting to to hear how he with same contravention same points the concern to the brings
in the days was moscow or budapest the capital
this were the ideals from the they us notifications and this  the regimes where they for worked
i am however welcome that the views within the labour in britain since are changed
i like the mr posselt thank for are report
the work that we the a friday in the parliament do is just legitimate if the work the we the a monday or to the just what other day out
indeed is that out that the on when the commissioner the bse the the item proposed someone said that there only members in the parliament present were
morning are there many more members and i would the regret when the friday not the use while we a really debate can to the other can respond and the time can take to to other to listen
the some the the partsession in strasbourg means a impoverishment the the parliament and the democracy in europe
i welcome this proposal than also to
the parliament can there proud the are than the proposal to up the this academy here is the and we are the portuguese presidency grateful that the this proposal has arrested and are the commission and the council grateful for their support
the is a good idea in a european union which people freedom  and freedom the establishment have and which people from scotland to sicily or greece can travel is the not more than logical that there a common system for enforcement the the rule the developed
currently there this common approach
myself am from from a the where the police is resulting from a chaotic situation a war
the was time however as sensible to civilians police the to up the social very involved are the the communities which they life and work
the can this police  mention but they milanese the the crisis the the war to overcoming and the idea the enforcement the the public item credible to make
time when i the european mainland visit am i somewhat surprised on the separate and the visible country drafting the the police
i would a harmonisation the standards in some member the the european union welcome
we all have in us own country abuses seen
i hope that this academy us will help the a better understanding the the whole system
president there there powerful criminals the think that there for them not laws there and the any to slim the are
since within the european union the surveillance is disappeared disturb they the also not more the frontiers
crossborder crime asking to a crossborder approach
because everyone the on agree is the there already years work the a reinforced cooperation between the police the the different member and their regions
three days ago i i to the the the reports marinho karamanou and roure out the the dangers the this suffers
a closer and centralised police the the stimulated from its environment looking its own priorities
the idea the a european police based the the were that there agreement there on the integrate and the method the the police
we see that the police in the one country the same situation very otherwise responding than in the other country
in netherlands is the police standard in causes the conflicts and in repressive tolerance which the there the  ethnic minorities the use the churches if  for people without legal committee and the organise the political protest if normal social phenomena be given
in some other countries the to my impression still still based the violence if method to behalf the authorities a  to win against everything what disquiet can that
the mr posselt has this week the contribution the the french president the de the the find the peace in algeria the example the the the role the kostunica would must play to the problem kosovo the to solve
he complained also the situation the which hitler could say that he impunity the jews could eradicating because the however no more the millions the the armenia suitably
the such moments can i the with the mr posselt very agree are
on the vision the the police continue we other probably sustainable the opinion differences
i give the prefer the a s trained and organised police the constantly the major by signals from the society which they must function
mr the president gentlemen members the up the the european police is according the commission a subject the the matter important for the european union not only if we think the the cooperation the the area the justice and home affairs but also in the framework the the enlargement the the european union the discussion on this subject the european level is a initiative the this parliament
already very early in that process has the commission the the member the promise done to actions to develop at the the achieve the what you a european  would can mention the efficiency the this type crime must meet the the agelimit possible professional standards and remain in a climate the respect for the rights and freedoms the the citizens
the commission is particularly welcome with the rapid progress the there this respect made is or by the portuguese presidency the this initiative has taken or by the french presidency that the to the the end the this year for this initiative will make i can therefore the that the efforts the all involved to will lead that there really a european police will be up and that still not year after a accordingly decision the the european council the tampere
i like therefore the parliamentary commission freedoms and rights the the citizens congratulate i thank the first and especially the rapporteur the mr posselt for are personal commitment
the is a excellent report with a strong analysis with this report the a important contribution made the the creation the the european police
what the future the the academy the the commission is as you know will are the opinion that conclusion the the european council the tampere clear the that the  the the academy what therefore what the the the virtual academy as not more than a first stage will are
just if the parliament is also the commission the opinion that there within short and clear defined deadlines a formula must be found the the  a greater continuity its and than not only for the higher 
i like there moreover the the point that we the here not have on the create the a european police
we have the on the need to experience and information from to exchange as can we reinvent how we the the crime the  can action against transnational crime without the to do the the respect for the rights the the citizens
there are countries as example the united kingdom the the always expressed have for a type  this originally british concept the now fortunately also in a number countries the continental europe accept
who really believe in the solutions the the itself defends not not afraid to are for a confrontation with the solutions the others propose
for the transition the a virtual police or  to a actually institute with the name enough the according the commission not to refer to the fact that only than the  the the different member efficient can work
the transition the only justified by the need to as soon possible a  to design for the police the the countries
this is according i a priority the not only for the countries itself the important is we must our citizens because the guarantee can give that enlargement the safety in the member not in risk brings
i i the parliament that that the commission prepared is the cooperation continue to to that applies not only for the up the the academy but also for the function that
i i knowledge taken the the proposal the the mr posselt according result the commission in a report would must up on the future the the academy the analysis the the council the administration the the academy would the if basis must
the commission is prepared that to do if there a this  decision the taken i believe moreover not that the council the the agree will are
the council has would that the police the according a intergovernmental dynamic development
for us is the the the highest important that there the the area the training as quickly possible actions be developed
also already is the commission the not in the centre the this process that means still not that we the developments not the near will follow we will us ensure make that the academy a success the
i am there than also the convinced that this project will contribute to the safety in the european area for freedom safety and justice freedom and justice can because only in a atmosphere the safety to their right to
mr the president i like there in the with the european police the point that especially the crime in the cities will must be fight
we be if members very often itself the victims the crime
i hope that the academy a first the will give to this in the future something the to do
the up the a european police european  college is a new step in the direction the a european police the changes classes take a such academy need to its interests to can protect against the demands the the people
crime is only a pretext
the up the a european police join however the fully the the the decision the the european council the feira to a mobile repressive  the to up with police judges and  the the european union will working the the management the nonmilitary crises where than also the the planet
we must here with particularly that point that the european police the probably in january a beginning will make with its work not only a network will are the the national bodies for  the the eu but also the central and eastern countries will include
the is even as that the to the whole matter still more to make has decided the seat the this academy close in the near the the borders between the current eu and the countries to to
therefore vote the european members the the communist party the greece against this report
accordance the decisions the the special summit the tampere has the portuguese presidency in june the this year a initiative tabled for the up by the council the a european police
we can us whole find in the objectives the this proposal the speaking the annual  for high officials and staff the the police the the member and the countries the all areas the the  which crossborder cooperation requires is
also can we us whole find in the elected method with the to this initiative there the because not new european structure up with the risk that this not would with the the national structures
there is precisely proposed to the european police the to up basis the the network the existing national institutes for high officials the the police
within any the this national institutions would a section the for the the european police must be up
this academy would therefore no a fixed seat to but the different places be located the council the administration the the european police would must there from the directors the the different national  the with full knowledge the affairs the needs would can the
thanks this structure can the police the developments the its territory closely continue follow and can there not differences the opinion the with the national specialists the the specific problems the head must offer
also the this structure a flexible organisation the police to which they better can respond the the developments the  would because can place within the best qualified institution
this is a good illustration the how a socalled europe the networks would can the that like say a europe that the countries directly with other in contact brings without that there unnecessary  for in the life established need to be
unfortunately is the european parliament in unlike to my group obviously not large favour the such organisation
in the by its tabled amendments trying the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs a other shape the the whole to give by to stress that the plan for this structure the temporary nature is they take that the structure the short term must be review and that the european police a fixed seat must to
if the this plans result the given will we on few years a new precious superstructure have the the over the national services will places bad with this services will work and also still agree its will are
to i i heard is the with europol same on the if this institution least not quickly the direction change
we are the opinion that the european police the best can function within a network the national services this applies moreover also for the most other forms the cooperation with particularly if the is to affairs if police justice and safety
i i voted against the report on the provisional up the the european police
there is a clear risk that the in the eu the the one area after the other believe that cooperation only but the promoted by the up the new institutions and the in the life to the new authorities
i am there also against that the text the the report in recital different the the text the the portuguese republic and one fixed seat for the police demand in place the a  cooperation
the fact that there execution powers be proposed in different considerations the the directive and that there harmonised imparted be proposed see i if a development in centralist direction with the risk that bad practices the place adopt the good practices

the the item is report a the mrs banotti behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the french republic with the view the the adoption the the regulation the the council on the mutual implementation the decisions on the  c cns
mr the president already over six year i i the honour to behalf the european parliament to should act if special mediator for international kidnapped children
this function was by president mutual created to the the a request the many french women whose children were mention and the not contact more had with this children
they rights the aid the the parliament in
since have still many others whose children were mention the aid the the european parliament possible
already more than six year matters i i with this issues are and also thanks the support and the resources the the european parliament i i a number important successes can make the the back the kidnapped children
in the most cases the the kidnapping the children by the central authorities the all member the very efficient and correct way dealt
unfortunately me i itself normally to make with the more complex cases
central the this regulation the during the french presidency in immense by the parliament is through is the its with children the parents the not the authority on this children exercise
this issue is now also know if the brussels iii issue the earlier a regulation than a directive is
if such has this regulation same restrictions if the treaty  but also a number the the strong points the this treaty
the regulation has only the the children the treats couples what still not sixteen year are
the is also a directive which the scope can be defined if modest and pragmatic and indeed is the a modest regulation
the regulation would the application are the parents the nationals are in a other member than where the decision on the authority is given and the claim want make the the 
the on the this regulation would the child in the framework the the implementation the the  for limited duration to the on other member can be transferred
the principle that a decision on the  in a certain member all in the european union the recognised would the essential important are for the success the this objective
the this principle would can be from if the over the the authority exercised can demonstrate that the visit if result the new circumstances the physical or spiritual health the the child in risk would to
this regulation and the treaty the den hague on the international kidnapping the children will other doubt strengthen
the regulation has not to objective the existing law and legislation the a certain member the to to the other member but objective only to mutual implementation the decisions on the authority
in some member with particularly germany and austria there constitutional any
a the the any is that the lightly over to access to the child can ask while the other over only eight days has to the the request to respond
without only doubt are many the our system extremely slow and cumbersome and are they difficult to they to in such affairs quickly judgement to do
a another objection the the forced return the children
i am the opinion that the there the good legislation the in all member the application is in considerable extent has contributed the the reduce the the number murders the children
hope will this regulation lead to less murders between member
unfortunately is the regulation not the application outside the european union and the risk there that they will contrary against the treaty the den hague
the council the ministers will the here however on consider and i recommend the parliament this regulation the to take
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes i like first our mr mary banotti congratulate and not only for its excellent report they working the namely already years the extremely  way in for the defence and the guarantee the the fundamental the children and than especially in the capacity the mediator the the european parliament with the to international murders the children
we must the french initiative a hot welcome whatever the cooperation within the civil  the still more and there is the a development in community sense where to take
this initiative join the the the development we deal now a regulation on children the separate parents
the is the to the right this children to visits and shelter to to the regulation the the exercise the the rights to facilitate and to prevent that children hostages be in a conflict between parents the in different member live
in this type circumstances is the unfortunately but already to often for that the parents terms out in a cycle the then the stages love hatred and vengeance ending
sometimes is one over this debt the sometimes are both parents responsible with the view the the welfare and sometimes even the safety the the children must we therefore quickly action
in such circumstances to there course easy relations and commitments to the between people with a different nationality or people the in different member live the is just inevitably that there from the commitments conflicts questions  and the coherent regulations on the  power
and that lead than again to problems with the to the right children to visits if this in a another country live sometimes be children mention example if a over the child after the expiry the the for the visit agreed term not the the other over elsewhere
in this regulation is the principle down the mutual recognition the decisions this the exercise the the  and the without  the opportunities to the implementation the this type decisions to suspend be limited
in such important affairs if the regulation the the  power and the exercise the the  must uniform rules there and the must directly can be applied this regulation is this meet
the the way strengthen we the community aware and the european citizenship
the is meantime the unfortunately that the scope the this regulation limited remains the facto the families with  children there not under
and that means that the rights the the children not in a community framework be recognised and therefore also not can be single
this type families represent in our countries however a reality according statistics the eurostat is the the in in the union the world has children 
to reasons the became is the therefore the large important that this you loophole the we must us realistic show with the to the social development and rights and obligations create for all citizens the the european union
to finally like i like my support express for the by the rapporteur tabled amendment the article there must clear be the that for  minimum one day must be the
we must there account that the that parents sometimes in far the other the parts the the union live the is to distances the thousands kilometres and than has the course little sense to a visit the to to for not more than a at
that would ridiculous are
the enforcement the the relations between the parents bears the a decisive way the to the education the the child and the training the his least
mr the president mr the commissioner i like first the french republic thank for its initiative to the discussing the a regulation which the right the personally contact between parents and children the regulated also thank i the rapporteur mrs banotti for its work
the is a fact that the europe without borders led has to more murders between people the different nationality from the european union but also from third countries
if however the such relations a end is questions often problems for the personally contact between the children and a the the two parents especially when they in a other member live
as other mr programmes already said be children also still more mention by a the the parents the refuses the children back to give
with this regulation the tried the procedure which parents their rights can exercise to simplify and children the possibility to offer regular contact to maintain with both parents this is therefore a extremely important regulation
course is the before regulation not perfectly proposal this is because bound the the regulation brussels ii and this the or children the separate parents or  children under
the mr other has this data the i i is the unacceptable and fully from the time that we in the europe the the st century only ensure for derogations for official legitimate children and for institutionalised relations between people
the to we the scope the the moreover excellent regulation strong i i must the as quickly possible all existing regulations review the based are the already long in the practice the the contemporary life outdated 
also must the the the drafting the regulations more account the with the the both having enlargement the the european union as with the repeatedly to expression take positions and opinions the the european parliament
mr the president my group like its assent express with this initiative and with the report the mrs banotti and like mrs banotti congratulate with the extremely valuable work that they if our mediator for international kidnapped children done
the there not doubt that the issue the down families one to the most harrowing affairs the we in us work stemming mothers and fathers the the ensure make on the its with their children the in a another country live
we must already the possible in the work to to this situation to improve and this the french initiative tabled regulation means a step in the good direction
i am the agree with mrs karamanou and others if they to that the given our current life regrettable is that the regulation only the has the children the people the chance are married or married are been
here is a task for the future
meantime welcome we this measure to and will this than also the i support
president divorce is now not exception more
often to couples the a proper way divided
they find the tow to each life to continue parts but they are their former partner not to hate
others separate unfortunately the the basis the a accumulated hatred
parents the separate from such situation are a disaster for their children the be victims the that insoluble conflict
the one over like the absolute  on the children to the other over for always from to the
any know the appalling situation which the over the who the child is allocated often the mother trying the contact with the other over impossible to make
we know also the least as  situation which the other over often the father the child them and european makes
that type events continue children the their whole life remind
my mother has such separation and kidnapping year ago seen and they talk there still still on
mrs banotti has creative tried to all opportunities to use the also crossborder a good  work
they trying all situations from to the which parents the there the different law in the member the the european union can abuse to a good  to delay or to prevent
a part the its solution is in a drastic restriction the the right to the judge in to decided for the incredibly the a foreign court
the regulation working only if both parents a nationality or a residence within the european union have and if their commitment was confirmed by a only marriage
only a part the the problem the resolved but there the the a precedent
if we that also the other situations would to apply force we us the term to a centralised  as the even between the länder the the united states not there
i see therefore any
but i i still many more any against the opportunity the legal weaknesses and  to a social problem sustainable unresolved to let
from our sympathy for the set objective vote we in with the proposed measures
mr the president gentlemen members i like first mrs mary banotti congratulate with its excellent report this report makes part from the a greater whole
i objective the the the extremely important and patiently course work that mrs banotti done the the area the the protection and the guarantee the the rights the children
as the parliament know are the commission and the council determined to against the end the this year a programme good to approve for the mutual recognition the legal decisions in the civil 
in that programme the priority granted the  as the during the european council the tampere defined are
the initiative the the french presidency is a step in the direction this report and this subject be the a friday discussed but i hope however that the press same press the as often that that the european debates not the the daily reality the the citizens with that aware affects that we here a subject deal that not only the life but also the heart the the european citizens affects
in may the this year have we a regulation adopted the the treaty the brussels ii in the community into
that has led to a simplification and clarification the the rules the the hand which must be the what court responsible is and what laws the divorce separation and allocation the  power must be applied
the initiative the the french presidency has the the the scope the the regulation the brussels ii the is here if i the as must to to a revolutionary initiative
for the first time the distance done the the exequatur the makes place for automatic recognition the a legal decision taken in one member what means that this in a other member the implement can be the
in this respect represents the initiative a step forward i part however the opinion the mrs banotti and a number other members in the sense that the regrettable is that the protection the the now like offer limited remains to children the born are within a if such by the law recognised marriage
the fact follows however continue from the scope the the regulation the brussels ii
therefore like i this parliament assure that the commission will proposals that there in the action for mutual recognition the legal decisions in civil affairs a programme that to we hope the the end the this year will be approved priority the given the the enlargement the the scope the the regulation the brussels ii that would mean that the regulation on the  problem the application would be the children the treats and unmarried parents
on the content the this document that as know not to the is has the initiative the the commission like i only three short comments make
first that we with the council work to the upon the the text to improvement and than especially with the to the complex issue the child must after end the the visit directly return and we must guarantees offer for the protection the the child
kidnapping the children or the longer to the children than agreed the is a with tragedy programmes must subject and this type situations is unfortunately elements for than we think
the is here to a sensitive balance the relationship with the council is now good and we are that convinced that the with your proposals possible must are to a solution to find the except technical correctly also be is
what the amendments the like i like say that the commission difficulties has with amendment as tabled by mrs mary banotti this amendment is further than a simple amendment the the procedural we really us now within the area the the harmonisation the the what
visits would least one day must take that is doubt good intended but the would there take to can lead that courts only than a  want their when the visit according them a whole day would must cover
and the is for that courts a  their the less than a day to reasons the to make have with the safety the the child
according i can we here better not legal binding provision give a indication enough we must there than the confidence that judges the the apply the the law on sufficient healthy sense have to a sensible  for to write
i like here also say and that has nothing to make with the by mrs banotti tabled amendment that the commission effort has with article the the by the french republic proposed regulation
this article the according us still still too the a intergovernmental approach the the legal cooperation
the can not evil that to point that the treaty the amsterdam the the legal cooperation a community matter makes
the commission which in article about the must not only from a intergovernmental view work
the commission will here active must action the same way if that shortcomings with the european judicial network in civil affairs we wait the a opinion the the side the the parliament
i join the mr the president gentlemen members with the insurance that i that convinced am that we here to make have with a in scope perhaps somewhat limited but therefore not less practical regulation they has also a important symbolic gentlemen and they represents if such a first and important step in a process that the european union closer the the citizens will to and than especially the the citizens the to what for reasons than also the table and had than the in the really separate are
mr the president i doubt not at the the involvement the commissioner vitorino the this subject
the provision on the  the one day applies clear for people the often the world on travel to their child to see
such situations are problematic when the on parents the child only twenty minutes should see
i think that when there a risk the kidnapping there this risk can be assurances by the visit under monitoring to let place
i am definitely the opinion that we there the the a or other way for must ensure that the rights the this parents which there free many are be respect
must i you ask your comment on article to clarify
scenario you the the contribution the the secretariat the the treaty the den hague is the the monitoring the the compliance the this legislation
thank you for your kind comments mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
we to now on to the vote
the parliament the the legislative the the president
mrs banotti has many years the this programme work
you must today the very satisfied are
us all congratulate
explanations
specific nature the the sport
the the item is the statement the the commission on the specific nature the the sport
mr the president gentlemen members the position the the commission with the to the legal the community policy and sport is down in the report on the conservation the the existing structures for the sport and the enforcement the the social function the the sport within the community framework the commission has this report the the european council the helsinki the december presented
the commission is the opinion that the with the treaty on the european union as that now the force is possible must are right to do the all aspects the sport that applies in the particularly the social function the sport
the repeatedly by this parliament expressed position in be and the law the the european court the justice confirm the interpretation the the commission
meantime is the the as that the enormous dynamic the the one market and the increasing commercialisation the the sport the have given to a number legal conflicts in this issue
there are organisations the say that this conflicts only resolved can be if there in the treaty a reference to the sport the included
the commission is the this not at that agree
the proposals as the are done by a number large federations the certain arms the sport represent speak the from for a protocol that the sport would discretion the a number from the treaty arising  and by especially the rules with the to free movement and competition
the is the important that to point that a such exemption if the the this way would be determine in not relationship the to what the the to achieve
we must recognise that sport today the day closely out is with other economic sectors we can the think the radio and television or the the promotion and sale the products in the sporting atmosphere
important still is that a exemption as this intended the end impossible would make community actions the for the the sport to develop
and that while other least just important organisations as example the national olympic committees and federations there still the insist that there community actions for sport must be developed
the commission has a opinion issued on the agenda the the now organised intergovernmental conference and they has there still for favour that this conference attention paying the institutional issues to as progress to can make the the enlargement
and that is the reason been that the commission in the relevant opinion not call does with the to the new common competition the the area the example the sport
order the special abilities the sport additional to emphasise and the community institutions guidelines to provide on the way which this the on issues dealt properly to be the there now under the french presidency work the a draft for the european council the nice what statement must be given if a supplement the the conclusions the the european council the santa maria da feira on this subject
the commission hopes that the statement once approved and if annex the the treaty the nice our the possible makes the work with the organisations continue to to so this organisations the can adapt the the new economic reality without the something the to do the the whole own nature the the sport
and that must than done with respect for the community legal the parliament has this in the mennea on the report for the council the helsinki moreover already the out
that is the way mr the president which the commission the dialogue the they the last months with the sport has held like continue
mr the president the there not doubt that the commission effort has to to guarantee that the rules the the policy on the internal market and the competition the the whole mainland and in all sectors the the economy the fair and correct way the implement be the
i recognise their commitment and their determination the this point and recognise course that sport and in the particularly football big business is and that not can be expect that this the least the the many legislation for companies
i am there no the convinced that the system in the football the this at top the black list the the commission would must are
the commission would there sensible the do this therefore the time to take if by means the a extension so we a result make that good is for both the internal market if for the football
the is i know that the fifa already a time  and already many to long has waited with its response the the official statement the the commission already in has made
the fifa has the current situation largely the itself to thank
we should however not forget that the football for millions citizens the the european union extremely important is
as a wellknown english    the proposed this is not only but a issue the life or death the is more than that
the european union must not its shoulders collection and say   when a ban the the system the football irreparable damage would cause
many small clubs are on the the income the the football that
 ensure not only for prosperity but the this also in the
how must be prevent that the salaries the footballers increasingly further increase when the transfers be abolished
the manufacturers the you  do than perhaps good affairs but that money is not to the football
i am the the i agree with the view the the commission that in the treaty the sport not not to be mentioned
what we need have is a intelligent and flexible interpretation the the current rules
i like there the the commission the insist to the constructive way consultation to to with the national and international  and would the commission want advise a many higher priority to give the other abuses the the internal market as the  the trademarks
i would like see that there many more measures were taken to to to to a internal market for newspapers and conference in very europe
also the car know still many to many trade
i recommend the commission this issues top its priorities to to and ensure to ensure that the football for the european union not objective the the the
mr the president i like start with the transfer the the greeting the commissioner viviane reding and its to thank for its initiatives the the area the sport
i am course also very welcome that commissioner vitorino the speech on the specific nature the the sport has taken
although the sport unfortunately still not legal in the european union has has they many specific characteristics which in the community policy account must be taken
after the summit the amsterdam is the that than also more to do
the sport has the the a or other way the the all european citizens
the wealth that hundred million people in the european union active sport both
the sport has many important social cultural and also very important economic dimensions
the is very good that the european ministers the sport want that there the the summit the nice a statement the made the if continuation must must the the almost a year ago spent 
since the the intention is ways the to to which in the community legislation account the taken with  can the speak the a gradual million in a important matter
the is not difficult the with the before agenda agree to are
there must especially attention be paid the the system and the protection the young sportsmen the role the national federations the  the clubs televising associations and ethical principles
if the the european sports form is give must the account the with the different structures the the sport
i hope therefore that the hear the associations after the meeting in sport in the continue
same must the aware that although many issues the a position require the have the  and business sport and movement for the individual and the society a wider importance has
there must example attention be paid the the opportunities the young to sport to both and the the equal treatment the men and women
the european parliament has are concern on doping expressed and more measures who called
the is therefore gratifying that the participation the the community the both the work the the wada world  doping caught if the the financing that still more the
the matter was wednesday in the coreper dealt
the is logical that in the future the union in the wada the represented by the commissioner the for  responsible is
mr the president i like the attention draw the the fact that the commission already powers the the area the sport has and than am i especially on the implementation the the competition
the commission has however demonstrated given the a large inefficiency in this matter
formula ppeed and especially the attempts the the mr  to the monopoly in the branch the sport to retain are already years investigated but there is not only result made
there is obviously there the a monopoly the televising a monopoly which the continuation by a agreement for a period the hundred year is guaranteed
in place the that the commission a position on the affairs its fact many commissioner the the  if a type  for the  and for the mr  and are they the the way responsible for the in the the the that monopoly
i hope that the commission before they new powers the this area the first the powers used the they already has
mr the president mr the commissioner best mr programmes what there the this at in the european union with the sport happening and than especially in the  and within the sector than again mainly the the football is the result the a legal without policy a legal where no really for has can choose
almost is the item a attack the the democracy also already recognise we that not like
the problems which we now to make have the problems therefore the now the core the the debate forms from almost all continue from a still repeated the time and were expressed contradiction that is especially the case since the bosman even if the affairs the the this directly or indirectly that to make have
many the the law properly to the oldest the we in the treaties can find they were already in the treaty the rome included already have they since the only changes are
well we can there certainly the are that no really no or the authors or the responsible for amendment the the original way the the standards than the the amendments later had can suspicion that the legal as we that now know as destructive would are for the sport
we had the on economy and than on economy  
we had the not on the society if whole in all social sectors is there the a stay the the economy to 
and that is what i mean if i say that we to make have with a legal without policy
a legal the is imposed a legal where no in has can take a absurd legal no has the ever really as wanted
they is behind and can not more particular be therefore is the the as large important that in the treaties recognised the that the sport a whole own dynamic has
as that not happening can the problems never the satisfactory way be resolved
we continue than hardship observe while the large money and the european union the sport to liberticidal help by to  with the unique life nature the the sport by the sabotage the the social network the the clubs and by intervention with the national would
if the unique nature the the sport not in the treaties recognised the will the sport time again the victims be the nonsense research and  legal violence what than again the result is the standards the not for the sport intended are and the no has can good or vote
the is not the intention fundamental law the the treaties or principles the community right aside to to
where the to is is that we a balance create account bearing with specific  the a sector the addition a enormous cultural and social important also economic activities has we must that in freedom can do and the considered to work to
the is is the authentic nature the the sport to protect the social function the the sport must in protection be taken against the already the other exclusive power the the market
i repeat the is is the sport to protect
we should the sport not in the abandoned let why let we to that the sporting training within the comprehensive network the clubs and associations who the
because we not want that there even but a ounce national identity clearly from the  the the clubs
in the sport and therefore also in the  is the only really important competition the sporting competition and not the  economic competition the the people the money deserve with the sport the a another
one few market is for the sport in europe moreover at not need
we have fifteen national markets all different all between the the competition as the in own country determine is
if we the united kingdom what further as see we that there even more than fifteen markets are already the markets together plus the the other countries the not part of the the european union that are the markets the traditionally given the point for the european competition forms
and what there now happening goes this right  the unequal distribution the the wealth writing the law for and the law is all prices them
a really authentic tradition the meaning which admitted the the the pressure the the large money
a bad working community  is this also guilty this legal makes destroying what really and sincerely is and  us a single in the embarrassment with  league programmes the only by  driven be
i decision with a reference to one the the conclusions the the resolution the we in september to the the the mennea have adopted the european parliament request the intergovernmental conference to a explicit reference to the sport the to take in article the the treaty so the eu recognises that the sport if cultural economic and social phenomenon to its sphere one
perhaps is the still not to late
i call everyone the ensure to ensure that the next intergovernmental conference not missed opportunity the
i call the french presidency the the promises the president jacques chirac done has fulfilling to do
the is this subject concluded
decision the the government the the united kingdom to a tax in to to for  
the the item is the statement the the commission on the decision the the government the the united kingdom to a tax in to to for  
mr the president the commission has knowledge taken the the package measures for the transport that the british government the november has become if response the the recent  the the oil
the government has under other announced a tax to want introduce for the use the the roads in the united kingdom example in the form the a  that all strike british and  would must buying
adopted that the details the with the introduction of by to meet the the current rules seems a such measure in agreement to are with the current community the is there because the at competition against to to by the costs the the infrastructure through a honest charging to stories the strike and the charging within the european union to harmonise
in the directive on this subject the in unanimously is adopted is down under what conditions member if they this want a tax or price for the required can introduce
six member belgium denmark germany luxembourg netherlands and sweden have when a common charging introduced that the know is if the  austria has are own charging maintained and france italy spain portugal and greece have their existing  maintained
in had twelve the the fifteen member the emphasis order the a indirect tax through taxes to a direct tax
the commission take this a good development since the a fairer charging is and the the to a more and more use the the roads
from the announced measures that that the united kingdom are charging also in the direction like adapt
the whole package the announced measures includes however more elements as a reduction the the fuel a measure the similar is with the measures the other member recently have announced
already this measures be currently investigated by the commission the there under the eu for responsible is that the activities the the member within the common policy be coordinated and the other are between
the commission expect therefore soon answer to to the its request to detailed information on the measures the the united kingdom has announced
then will the commission as they also the other member does must into or this measures competition to result have within the community
already to according the outcome the this research will the commission determine what steps they must to to the member to help measures to take the in their own important are without that the interests the other member it be damaged
mr the president i thank the commissioner for are speech and for the fact that he here is has to morning on this subject to talk
what he just has said is new for i since i had understand that the the intention was to a special tax in to to for all foreign vehicles that like say all  vehicles the use make the the roads the the united kingdom
i consider this earlier if a political the than if a political or tax measure
i i understand that the costs in the united kingdom without the special tax the in the new proposals is by similar are with the in the rest the the european union and the same level are if the transport in france
also already says the commission that a country a such tax must introduce and also must let apply for own vehicles i i the as if a distortion the the internal market because british strike probably through the  with a stability payment the their obligations will meet while other users the the british roads time if they the united kingdom enter the the border a special tax will must pay
what the commission also may think this is a distortion the the internal market and the the free trade
the proposal has especially you consequences for ireland
ireland is clearly a very small but open market the most that we buy is from the united kingdom
we buy annual for billion gbp goods from the united kingdom against only billion from the rest the the european union
from that in what extent the irish industry and trade the british market terms although this situation not will continue there if the british gbp as such strong currency remains if now the case is
the this at buy any irish citizens for euro goods from the united kingdom
i think that this measure absolutely in fight is with the free trade irrespective the allows possible the affairs the the commission has given
mr the president i thank the commissioner for are speech and for the facts the he has confirmed
the seems i sense to the this at to speak on the proposals the the government the the united kingdom has done there is because both in the united kingdom if in the rest the the european union there the a crisis in the 
in the first place must said to be that the not to a specific british problem is
the proposal was tabled by the minister the finance in are provisional  the anticipates the the final budget the spring
he is when with a number proposals has with the to the  not only the proposal to a  in to to
i can my irish mr programmes assure that the know was with the  when the proposal for a  was done and that the  similar will are with the  the as commissioner vitorino already has said in several other member the the european union there
there they moreover the out that lorries from the united kingdom currently to make have with  or  the roads in other eu while such taxation to the date in the united kingdom not there
i am that convinced that the government the the united kingdom the the request the the commission will respond and in discussion will act with the commission and the  to ensure to ensure that the  will with the the current 
us  must still in detail be developed
i i understanding for the concern the the mr mccartin has expressed but i i the idea that many the what on the british system the said not based is the facts but the rumours and the what there in the industry the said in place the the what the british government has proposed
i know that the government the the united kingdom consultation like to with strike and i know also that the government the aware is the the special position the ireland and i am that convinced that they is talk with the mr programmes in dublin and in belfast
late the clear are that the united kingdom are proposals does in the full aware that the the european union must consult and in the full aware that there eu there which the the must to the
the united kingdom aware also that the if the the  apply are own strike with equal taxation must europeanism
the aware that the a system must are that not discriminatory is
to finally like i say that the fact premature is to this now in the european parliament to debate but i am however welcome that the happening and i am welcome with the statement the commissioner vitorino which clear that that the british government the right has a  in to to provided this in agreement is with the rules and regulations the already there
i think that that is what the government the the united kingdom like
mr the president with all respect for the mr simpson but i am the not with him agree
i think this debate in the whole not premature
if a important proposal the this nature to raised the the must we in this house the opportunity have to there as early possible on after to think and on to discuss that not all not in one time
moreover was i just as he the commissioner particularly grateful for are extremely clear speech which he said under what conditions such taxation conform with the community and which he to know by that the opportunity large is that we here not to make have with a foreign delay but with a proposal that the in agreement is
i was that the mr simpson with are speech a particularly sensible contribution has made by us reassure to to the regard the the alleged intentions the the government the the united kingdom
i like also like respond the the comments the the mr mccartin
the trade with the united kingdom is important for ireland but that applies also opposite
as is the economy the  the informed the from and loch ryan in high extent on the the movement that through the maintenance  is the even nottoodistant between the united kingdom and ireland
our citizens are in important extent on the that trade
i like like say that the  would are to a  in to to the for the the infrastructure but the then not to use to the infrastructure to improve
the way the the  to the  lead the a state in a tragic the
perhaps to we now last a serious and sustainable improvement the the  the our two economies with other link
i hope the i that this a the the consequences will are
mr the president  and  are course sensitive and certainly the us in austria where this a subject the continuing discussion is we seek course us to solutions to the movement in good jobs to lead
the commission has a excellent green presented which fair pricing central are a the the principles the this green is that  between different transport must be avoid and that the money that the this roads the roaming especially must be used to the problems the same roads the to solve
the commission has also very clear noted that accidents currently the the  are
safe and good stepping roads are a essential condition for the prevent the accidents
currently the there in europe approximately casualties per year
very many people to not in the last place by bad bad benchmarks chaotic or psychological wrong stepping roads to the life also costs the compensation the the from accidents arising ranging our social insurance many money
prevention is therefore is
we must ensure ensure that the people safe way are and we must there in the important the the environment especially for ensure traffic to prevent
traffic are too and to high costs with the that but forms especially a large environmental if the british government the resources than also really used to the existing problems the to solve think i that everyone this what the has and that with particularly all european citizens the might are
mr the president i would want start with the question why this subject the the agenda the
i was monday in this house present when the agenda was the
this point is when not the the agenda the
later when a the our mr programmes mrs doyle this subject to the were decided the president suddenly that this subject the the agenda had be the
this is not democratic and fair way to the agenda the this house the to to
the agenda the the by the house and not through a  between one member and the president
i like also the that mrs doyle here today not present is to part to take the the debate
than like i now like further like the the subject in issue
the is good that there on this subject the discussed
i i just the story the the mr mccartin  and the is clear that he the the the wrong end has
in the proposal be british strike not allowed over transporters or strike from the rest the europe
the has the the all strike or they now from the united kingdom to or from a another country
this must not doubt on there
and although the proposal still not in detail is developed was i the encouraging to from the speech the the commissioner to hear how the issue will be tackled
i am that convinced that the british government the commission will involve the the way which the  must be introduced
i like also like like the a point that the the item is the by the mr maccormick
he had the on the trade between ireland and scotland and he mentioned with particularly the southwest the scotland the informed the from and loch ryan
he said that he same that the money that with the  will be roaming the used for the improvement the the infrastructure in the southwest the scotland
the southwest the scotland one to my area and the infrastructure is this indeed not already to best the is certainly for improvement room
but i like like against the mr maccormick say that this  intended is for the whole united kingdom
the is intended to the roads the the whole united kingdom to improve
we can the yield not only the good let to the a small part the the united kingdom
the whole united kingdom must that benefit
that is something what we clear must to
with the to your first comment mr miller part i you also that the president the house this proposal has done and that this house there then that agreement is has to the agenda the today to change
mr the president just if various other members the here morning present are come i from the united kingdom the country that others money from the europe true
we are as approximately the only oil country the the european union but we have the the highest  and the highest strike the europe a litres diesel costs in the united kingdom gbp
the tax the car programmes is in the united kingdom eight time higher than in france therefore the is not as strange that the the this in us country serious ensure makes
when i if british injures use concerned the the french motorways must i french price pay
when i from strasbourg to calais  i i after end the the journey the feeling that i the owner am the the french roads because the  as enormous high are
last summer was i in austria and paid this for the austrian  i was this completely fair and reasonable and the price was many  than the price the the the french motorways the on
my objection against this proposal is not that the unfair is
the british government is last with a reasonable solution has
my party has same proposal two year ago done
the current british government has the situation from the hand let are and is now rather late with a proposal that probably only on still agree two year actually the force the
if the plan really are up the want we that the government the gains the good late to the the british road
mr the president since there a number european countries is where with  the work and there other countries are the with a  work will you the with i agree are that the  not good system for the internal market is
a danish or british stand the in own country days per year worth for are money but a foreign stand from a other member the to the country travel perhaps for one or two days or for ten days or even for hundred days the that not
he pays many to many for are  unless there a special  the  is
would the not better are now we in this stage are instructions to after to think on a mutual  so the  the the one country in other countries the recognised than have we a  that really working
the commission must the to the on proposals the must lead to a common system for very europe
than address i i now like to my friend the mr mccartin
i am the agree agree that irish  in a special position situation
by the geographical location the their country are they forced to by the united kingdom to their just as good if british  by netherlands belgium and france must to other eu to can achieve
the best what the united kingdom can do to the irish and also the scots to help is to work the improvement the are very   because we are on the this roads to our  to achieve
yes the way between from and  is really a cederschiöld
but the is also problematic to the birmingham and london to to and to the doldrums and the  the the channel to achieve
the best what the british with this additional money can do is the roads to improve in the hope that this to better  between the united kingdom and ireland will lead

the parliament has the several times strong expressed on the commitments the in kyoto are done
i think than also that the european delegation this strong position rightly has welcome the the conference the den hague
the is however the very important that there now quickly the a new draft the work
therefore think i that we your proposal must follow the condition that there a resolution the up which during our partsession the december in strasbourg voted will be
the parliament importance are approval the this request
welcome
conference the den hague on climate
the the item is the statement the the commission on the conference the den hague
i give immediately the floor the mrs wallström the behalf the commission its speech will the
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen i thank you that you i you invited to my impressions on the sixth conference the the parties the participate the the treaty the the united nations on climate the socalled  with you to parts this conference was in the last two weeks in den hague place
also after intensive negotiations both the technical if the ministerial level the basis the grievance with approximately teenager only was the not possible a comprehensive agreement on the main political issues to achieve
in the negotiations complex the european union the to the the work the the  the the  the the area the  and forestry the issue the the  the relationship between the  and home measures the socalled  and the compliance
this was that in the consultation with other parties the  had be 
there was good technical progress made with the to the rules for the  and the development the a  this could the the the the final negotiations especially up the compromises between  and 
the the last at were still compromise for the use the the  tabled there was however not enough time to the consequences the this proposals for the different countries within and outside the european union good to can assess
however was there sufficient the to to fear that the the  the the policy serious favour would be done
therefore decided the european union this proposals the to point
the parties wanted prevent that the mandate the the action the growth growth that the force was to the the socalled  would end without that there there was the any specific result or followup therefore have they decided the  the to suspend and to resume in may
the  was not only but disappointing far the that
we have here and this many progress made
as is there example a package measures up which the responded the the needs and ensure the the developing this package the under more new financial resources and new institutions
also is decided to a more specific approach the the climate within the global  facility the socalled  the technical level is also progress made the other areas as policy and measures the reduction the the emissions length transfer the technologies trade in shelves joint implementation and compliance
we must everything in the work to to this decisions during the followup in may final to make
a other positive result the the  is that he has contributed to a better understanding for the positions the other parties
this knowledge is extremely useful in the next months must we the the the work to
the mr pronk was a particularly committed 
the proposal that he the the end the the second week  talking a package measures that in the next months a the the principles will are for further debate and negotiations
there was however not time to the negotiations the basis the this document final the to conclude there was too precious  lost has with ministerial statements and with the still again repeat the wellknown positions
if result of was there not enough time to the effects the all different proposals with the to the  the the the last at still were tabled to analyse
there remains time still many uncertainty there the this point
we knew all that the european union to a agreement with the united states and its allies the the  group to achieve concessions would must do
end were the concessions the the other parties the regard the the  the enforcement and the  not to the down the the objectives for  the would are the if we the proposal on the  had adopted to compensate
how to we now further
the first priority for the european union is that we the results the the conference to evaluate and further discussions to prepare
the preparation the the followup must the eu not the discussion again to open on all issues they must the up the key with particularly the  the  and a strong 
we must ensure that the transition the the presidency the france to sweden smooth process also must there closely contact continue with the mr pronk
the eu must its positions on the important issues review and where need new proposals formulate
the commission will there everything the do to together with the new presidency a strong joint  to develop
addition further coordination within the european union must also the contacts with the other parties be although
want we during the followup to a agreement on the  to than is the a absolute condition that we all on same facts and figures have and that all parties not longer with their own calculations to encourage
the eu will its relations with all important groups strengthen also will they as quickly possible contact into with the new government in the usa
since the rules and methods for the function the the  not are adopted will the ratification the the protocol must be postponed to after the next session the the 
the internal preparation for the ratification by means the the european  and the development the a plan for the trade in shelves in the european union will however simply continue
i thank you for your attention and i am prepared already your questions to answer
mrs the president i regret the that the commissioner the  in den hague obviously if very frustrating has perceived i congratulate its however with the fact that they optimistic is has
the delegation the the european parliament the the discussions was just as disappointed on the outcome already was the for us not if a surprise
we had the problem that creating on the  certainly can for just if they moreover
who the french and british newspapers read will see that there many attention the spent the what the end seems to are the the good relations between the french minister  and the british minister prescott
in certain sense were they two components the a accident that the had done just if the titanic and the tip
the mr prescott seems now a shipwrecked ship which we not know how long the will continue introducing
purely for myself say i i the feeling that the problems under more the because a green minister completely not area has to to negotiate on green issues
the was for mrs  impossible the american position to accept and no could that also the its expect
the first think they that there only flexibility to expect is in the position the the european union the regard the the 
and the third rightly the statement the the mr prescott in the british house
many countries and with particularly the  had the feeling that here there was the a huge loophole the agreement would a border have the the the extent which the united states japan and canada forests if  would can use
europe had already only time the the a such limit also would the agreement the use the  in own country the more scientific conditions have subject
why have given the not really remarkable imaginative report the the mr prescott on the by he to the take deal not only mrs  but to i believe also the most other european environmental the deal fact all rejected that is my last question the the commissioner
the report the the mr prescott the are own parliament gave however the impression that he their a supply had done that they not could refuse
i join the with to say that i regret what there is happened i hope however that we end the optimism the mrs wallström will parts and the needed agreement on climate will to
mrs the president in the first place would i the commission want say that they its work good has done
i hope that the european union also the the next conferences with one voice will speak and the is i i nothing than time to now certain ministers the debt in the them to want it
that brings us not step forward
we know that the failure the this conference not the end means the this very long and complex process but that the will be continue
now must we us ask what for improvement room is
in the first place rice the question and that is immediately a question the the commission or the elected method with conferences where the representatives the countries the agree must be on a text not to high matter is especially when the against the end in time has and the differences between the most partners still always not from the way are overcome
is the not time that the government and state the the united states and europe this issue also the the  discuss
we should the ourselves however not to easy make
we can the with the  finger to the americans point but we should not forget that the also to us can point because the is not as that we in europe everything as good the item have
the co the the us to that know we and we have that here often enough discussed
but the is the question or we the a global agreement need have to the us with the reduction the emissions to start
i like the commission remind the its communication on the trade in shelves and on the conference the den hague according what the commission possibly a directive would present the the in by the ministers the environment agreed quotas would prescriptive and infringements with sanctions would punish
now would i want questions or you also prepared you to a such proposal for to to if the process the kyoto still not is completed
why would we within the european union not in with the trade in shelves start if a number member here within the own borders however already that started is
to finally is the i i rightly that you the the issue the the  footing the document you taken especially because the extremely difficult is this draw exactly to measure
we want measurable results achieve and the mean i  measurable results that was with the american position far not feasible
mrs the president the was the the beginning the the clear that this negotiations difficult would are the officials the the commission believed however that end a deal would be closed because the political leaders in the world simply to many to lose had if they with emptyhanded hands home would to
the is particularly disappointing that there not agreement is achieved i regret the also the very that the end the the conference was  by a argue between the british minister and the french presidency on the by the british minister drawn compromise
the fact that after the rather  departure the the mr prescott the americans new proposals were the still closer in the near the the exerting were shows the that the french presidency rightly footing the document had taken
we were still closer the a agreement but unfortunately s we in time
the fear there that the shipping there now from is that there other american negotiators will to and that we in may again the for the the must start
the lack the agreement within europe is more to zimbabweans because i during the conference however especially the impression had that the european union if closely  team  they consumers from a joint position the here by the  across was and the the member united behind joint principles a joint perspective and a joint displeasure on the refusal the the americans to their responsibility if the producer the greenhouse the world under view to see
the what we have heard must we adopt that the american senate the  not will ratify how concessions we also do
therefore must we higher priority give the the seek and acquire the the support the other countries we must the trade in shelves encourage and specific measures take to the greenhouse in the union to reduce
let we hope that we in may a agreement will achieve in the meantime must europe the role take
the usa remains a very important country
money plays in the american political a important role than here in our union
the american industry and the oil  their politicians that they the  must reject what the american public also says
i like the commissioner questions how we to its opinion the american industry that can convince that the in their own business important is that they the protocol support they can than with the wellrun  and the american politicians to the item to
how can we them specific  the st century with already its problems 
president the conference on the global is failed but there is the certainly progress made
nuclear has not opportunity the a 
the developing said if you in the north put with nuclear than want we also not nuclear even not subsidised
also the the area the the enforcement is there progress
the developing to after billion dollar
if the portrayed  is work than received the developing annual between the five and the twentyfive billion dollar additional
what the the developing has president pronk good work done but the  was are compromise not
the forests were this time the large 
three year ago in kyoto wanted the usa that russia the possible would make that the americans in own country not measures did to take
now wanted the from the costly measures forests let grow
course are forests  but if they  are is this effect way
also fires forests also the and that happening still more
the solution must to the  and renewable energy
our negotiators behalf the european union wanted the certainly only area let for forests but not more than the all to take measures
the deal the prescott which the united states through forests through hot air and through  would should do was a bad unacceptable deal
fortunately were the the environmental the here on agree
but we must further in  in may must equal be there
any citizen has same right the co not the americans time so if the africans
only if equal the there will the developing also after that to do the the fight against climate
to stabilisation the the climate with equal to achieve must the usa with back and must we if european union with back
than must china are emissions stabilise and than must india two time so emit
in may next year is a breakthrough need if without the usa
also without the usa must and can the  ratified be
i hope that we to this wisdom will decisions
president industry and movement lead to a artificial warming the our exploration
a part the the territory the the countries the the european union will the a inservice warming change in sea or in a desertification
to the world and europe sustainable effort to the is a strong change the our economy need
the european parliament has the recent expressed for a number steps in the good direction
the the european position during the last saturday in den hague cease and probably failed  signs the two strong conflicting views the
the one view is that we seriously must the to the the the agreements from to over under the emissions the rightly to to
the is now to the fulfil the the already commitments kyoto the willingness to a compromise with america means treason the the european commitment
the other view is that kyoto never be is been because the from the america japan and australia this to large is only by their triumph to reduce is now a  possible
with creative accounting would we than the impression give that they already the a large part the their obligations have met
in the second view has the european union fail because the green environmental the france and germany not prepared were to kyoto to forget
during the followup in  in may would be such compromise must be found
my group favour for the first vision
the is important that europe notion the a earlier welcome position also if that means that the united states a such agreement in a age the the  still not will can support
for the results the the longer term is the important that we the american public opinion convince the the dangers the  in place the a compromise to the with those the incredibly
the usa produce per head the the population the the pollution
this is the aware that the desertification will grow and hurricane will increase still not strong in the public opinion present
the prosperity is there high and the price the petroleum low
real changes take the this adverse for industry and consumer
therefore is the unlikely that a  now assent the the american parliament would can to
finally the third world the still but only the the beginning the the industrial development
their poverty has them must to their rights the emissions the co to sell the rich countries the the their own obligations want reduce
the countries will the end their rights the the development not let reducing
the emissions the greenhouse will than still strong to increase
the is a reason to the the followup the the  with the exacerbated account to the
a compromise can not mean that we forget what there in kyoto is agreed
mrs the president just if the majority majority in this parliament and the previous speakers am also i particularly disappointed that the interwoven on climate in den hague not success is become
the is very to regret that the participants not agreement have can achieve on the question how we in the future the best the emissions the greenhouse can reduce
in the kyoto the three year ago is a timetable the for the reduction the the emissions the greenhouse
this  must under not circumstances be weakened
contrary if we the consequences the the warming the the earth a stop want drain and end want reduce must with particularly the industrialised world in the future perhaps still the sharper borders the the emissions the greenhouse the
if we in the future still a planet want have which we all can live is the issue the the climate clear a the the the challenges the we in the st century will must into
if we this issue not the a systematic and integrated way tackle will the warming the the earth increase this will by to with serious consequences for the environment the the country in the sea and in the air to still but not to speak the the consequences for the human itself
there is already said that the next meeting which the issue the the reduction the the emissions the greenhouse will be discussed place will find in  this meeting will corresponding with the publication the a report the the intergovernmental panel on climate the the united nations
this panel there from approximately scientists from the whole world the will say what measures to their believe need are to the emissions the greenhouse to reduce
the environment the this parliament has in the past first got the the approach the the issue the the climate
we can us very good find in the policy the the commissioner for environment mrs wallström for what the a number  and directives the will help the greenhouse in the european union back to insist
the european union must in this matter the role take
the environment and the parliament have in the past the good example given with their collective approach the the issue the the reduction the greenhouse
we must this policy in the future strong and decisive continue
otherwise will the future generations because the price must pay for us lack the action the this particularly important area
i congratulate commissioner wallström with its efforts in den hague and wish its in the future more success to
mrs the president also the us is the disappointment large that the  in den hague failed is
discussions on the  lead to easy to the unilaterally point to the united states
i i is the end the rigid attitude the the european union been which there not agreement is has
the discussion in den hague was especially on the question what there all included must be the the agreed reductions the kyoto
in october have we the the treatment the the proposal on  can choose for efficient and effective opportunities to the emissions back to insist
unfortunately is by the european parliament when not clear choice made
what the rule the must i say that this never a objective the the must to are
if with the united states a agreement to achieve is on a lower  in own country is this always better than not agreement
same applies for the partially entitlements the the  as additional produce the forests
although i not good floor on i for the american attitude note i the that the the end the the conference the united states to a acceptable compromise prepared were
the rigid attitude the the european union under leadership the the french    the possibility to a agreement
some prices the attitude the the european union because they their back right have taken
in reality are the opportunities for a agreement in the future smaller what means that we further from are the a adequate approach the the scenario
mrs the president just if my other mr programmes am i particularly disappointed on the results the this conference the den hague the may clear are that they completely failed is
i like i not with the mutual countries interfere since as such whole negative approach not few sense has
i like the commission congratulate and course also mrs wallström the its convictions with the to the reduction the emissions always faith is has
course is not agreement better than a bad agreement the american proposal into serious to briefly and was therefore for europe fully unacceptable
a acceptable agreement can moreover only be achieved if there there is the balance between north and south that like say between the developing and the industrialised countries
i am serious concerned on this right to to pollute since i think that this the gap in economic development between the north and countries the the economic area already a behind have will be increase
the position the the united states that forests if  as must be is unacceptable because this means that they the not few effort would need to make
we must the behind american conditions addition us accept
the restrictions the this europe with are europe presidencies be now moreover good visible we enjoy because not strong political image the relation the the united states the with one voice can speak
this shows again the need the to against any price the european institutions and their function to reform
when will we can have on a strong president the our european union the in the is to the relation the our partners with one voice behalf europe to speak
however is there still a morningstar hope
the in den hague taken conference will next spring in  be continue as you us already has announced mrs the commissioner
we will you saying are to the the demands the the united states the head to can offer and this challenge the to to
mrs the president mrs the commissioner best colleagues let we the but clearly and ready to the  in den hague is failed and that is disappointing because there are still more evidence that the climate still many more change than expect
the world has therefore a strong political signal need
kyoto must not empty promise continue
the failure the the  is to the public a wrong signal
many people will to think that the not such shipping the with the  if the international political however nothing does
that undermining also the support for sustainable energy and for the 
climate have large consequences in the developing
countries if india bangladesh indonesia and thailand be faced with floods the millions people take
we have the principle the polluter pays high in the hold are but to now to are the the third itself the pay for the costs and for the adaptation the the climate
that is what i the unacceptable
mrs the commissioner the statements on the failure the the  were not very credible
the negotiators seem later that the agreement within scenario was
the political like would the not must have parties would further to other has are and they showing still more understanding for each culture
but unfortunately was there lack the time
this is what i the not very credible
behind all fine words is political inability find
the european union will carefully its own role must evaluate
the enough not the united states the debt to give or to complain on lack the flexibility the others
we have itself still said that not agreement better is than a bad agreement but that means still not that we us own political  to yardstick the a good agreement must make
the  is in the spring further
we must now therefore forward
mrs the commissioner i like you thank for the  cooperation
i would you to finally three questions for want to the first how assessment yourself the action the the european union and what specific lessons form you from the failure in den hague
the second the what way use you the next months
the you with the united states a discussion on the  and on the scientific facts and lack the this still a role play
the third the what points must the european union according you more concessions do
i itself am the believe that we the the point the the  perhaps what more water the the wine would can do
like your opinion this and i thank you for your attention
mrs the president commissioner wallström thank for your contribution
to my opinion was the eu a unity apart the the last critical hours
the is however clear that this conference many losers has has
i think that we if politicians if losers from the fight are has because we a extremely wrong signal have issued to very many committed people we are there not in managed to to a agreement to to
also think i that the entrepreneurs and other players in the business the this problem seriously approach and the like rules see also lost have
therefore is the course the large important to again quickly the other to to
i think that the eu there good the done has the the point the the  not to to give
the is not only difficult  and measurable but still more researchers say or they right have know i not that the  the today probably the  the tomorrow are
late i the again in the english say   ohne    to  
if that where is is the course very conventions to this now already in the negotiations to involve now the definitions not clear are
mrs wallström i am earlier inclined to to say that the in the future dialogue with the americans better  can are what the   in the general than there something the to involve what scientific already very difficult to financing is
i was member the the delegation the this parliament
we have a number american delink about
the selfdefinition and ignorance the the americans the the day established  i somewhat
i was the feeling that they under not circumstances the  want ratify
i am to the conclusion has that the dialogue between the united states and europe on this issues must be although not only between the governments and the commission but with particularly with the delink
this can we the the european parliament contribute
to finally still a question if the conference in may failed is the commission than prepared to further to to the role to take and a ratification the the on the the eu for to to
mrs the president gentlemen colleagues to to start wish i if president the the delegation the the european parliament the the  my pleased from to speak on the excellent relations between the commission and the parliament
if there during the  something without compensating is has than is the the the cooperation between the delegation the the european parliament and the commission
same can not the the european ministers be said some under them showing only but interest for the conferences and were not few effort to the to to the the spirit the agreement the need is to a global policy on climate to the to to
mrs the president everyone was know with the crucial role the the  they had us in the opportunity to the act the the floor to add and a point to to behind the  which we us since are
since there not agreement is achieved can we however not to action move
let we did language speak and the balance made the is clear that only a the the three parties tried has to a agreement to to and a global policy on climate the to force the european union
the united states or would said the  group in are whole let we there please not let to let have a hope excuses the world abandoning to to prevent that the the  in den hague a agreement would be achieved the now to may to the the meeting in  must the european union the two fronts active are
one must they good aware that the ratification by the united states very what being in the earth will have hence that there diplomatic actions the before the the other members the the  group must be taken
hand must the union the necessary internal measures take to its credibility the to outline
that is the only way to to guarantee that they the the  b in  in floor and act the role will can take
mrs the president thank for your support i thank especially also the delegation the the european parliament the in den hague present was
i remind i still good a meeting with mrs mr the the whole time present is been and the morning already to half six the way was to a meeting
you all you i during the conference particularly good supported and this thank i you the i
we discuss the issue the the climate sometimes if the consequences that only the the long term by our children and grandchildren will be felt
the climate is however already started
the  integrate and that is measurable
small  in the pacific atlantic disappear slowly under the increasing climatic
we see the consequences also in us daily life
the experts avoid in the general carefully to a certain storms or certain extreme weather to to write the climate but we will as the climate change still more with extreme weather to make to
the affects therefore also ourselves
course is the especially a matter for the next generations but climate is also now already a fact especially for people in poor countries also that is already said
what can we now do
the is now not the right at to guilty the to point
the is now the at to to decisions that we us not second failure can afford
we can the next  simply not without a agreement conclude
i am rather optimistic because we to my idea very close the other are has all ministers understand that five cent reduction as the in the  still but a small part is the the total effort the we us for the future must make
this is still but the beginning
perhaps must we us not such ensure make if we something more time need have still a few months to decisions to take on the rules and a legal framework the necessary are for the enormous economic market the will the
course have we a number clear practical rules need for a market in shelves with a extent the billion dollar there had the this negotiations still too be regulated
we must try that now the to act further will we our own assessment must make the what there happened is
we must the documents prepare the need are to contact to to with different parties and course also with the  group
the is now especially the the american government to us to tell with who we must talk
we must also our contacts with the developing continue
the this way can we the a constructive way the this issue further work
now will i like the the question or we the flexible enough are been
sometimes are this type negotiations extremely chaotic when you than  be you  always say that you also mistakes you made
for the environmental meet in den hague where we as you know also the tone have the are the objectives however still the credibility and the integrity the the protocol the kyoto been
we have than also any form the creative accounting with the to certain issues rejected
the americans established us a proposal for that their effort with to cent would have reduced
that could we simple not accept
had we our ambitions must reduction while we knew that we precisely more had do
same have we also concessions done
we are the discussion made on affairs which we earlier had said that the real  were or least could be
we have us very constructive up and the this discussions in den hague to the last minute 
also in the future will we prepared continue concessions to do to my conviction are we however not only flexible been but have we same also still our objectives defended
this must we continue do we know now the questions the for this last part the the conference the table are
i am hope voted because i am there really the convinced that everyone the now aware is the what there the the stake the
all ministers know that they this enormous responsibility in the fight against climate not from the way can to this was also already clear after the meeting in den hague
we will there everything the do to the the basis a agreement to achieve that we also really can sign
course must the followup the the  or the continuation the the conference the den hague lead to the ratification the a agreement within the union
we can however already earlier with the trade in shelves start
many the the by the commission proposed measures can we now already take
as we the opportunity to as there a legal framework is set will we this start
i thank you again for this debate i i note taken the everything what you you said
course will we this further the the work to we are also like prepared back to to when the parliament therefore asking
i like mrs the commissioner and all mr programmes you thank
the debate is closed
preparation the the european council to nice with including the the policy
the the item are the statements the the council and the commission on the preparation the the european council to nice the to december with including the the policy
i like behalf you all minister presented védrine the i welcome whatever
i give you now the floor mr the presidentinoffice president the the council
mrs the president gentlemen presidents gentlemen members i am here today has to your plenary parliament to inform on the way which the presidency the european council the nice preparing
the the agenda are particularly important issues also already forms they certainly not good reflects the the total number issues that this six months the the item is has or the the results the in this period are made
course must during the european council only the issues to be resolved which only the state and government the can express i think the in first body the the institutional reform
also must during this council guidelines for the future and general political impetus to be given the french president is here the december in own person the balance with you made
the most issue that the members the the council in nice will deal is course that the the reform the the institutions further must the members the the council to work the what hope if the treaty the nice the history in will to
next week sunday therefore still for the the start to the the european council will pierre moscovici and myself ministerial consultation to i i the gentlemen brok and tsatsos asked to also the this consultation present to are
also want we monday the opportunity the the council general affairs a meeting the the igc invest to us a good picture to can forms the how the negotiations there in the stage as level for the summit the nice stand
we will the this opportunity also with the president the the parliament to i hope the fruitful way the opinion can exchange
i like here today therefore say how the negotiations there with the to the most issues the this at stand
during the informal european council the biarritz are important progress made with the to the issues the the qualified majority and the closer cooperation
also is there the the opportunity a enlightening debate held on the composition the the commission and the votes the the vote thanks this debate has any the the member the a better picture can forms the the objectives and any the the other member
pierre moscovici has you this the october informed
the basis the this situation are we the last weeks the find has to a compromise where any the in can find us objective remains however to in nice a ambitious agreement to the
sometimes me i to hear that the presidency to little ambitious is this is however nonsense
look but agree to the texts the we the for the the igc have up despite the complexity the the issues i i really the feeling that the fifteen member actually a agreement want achieve
what the issue the the qualified majority the recover the work steadily if the member demonstrated give the their good like will there will on such thirty issues with qualified majority voted can be
some countries have however serious any with the to many the issues as the coordination the the social systems the tax issue the asylum visas and immigration and the negotiations the the area the the services
this last issue is particularly important we will however positive voted the negotiations the nice like and the so possible the this sensitive issues progress try to make
a another important element in the debate has the the the role the the european parliament
the most member are the agreed agree that many areas the for the talking the the qualified majority in eligible to also must be opened for the codecision that is because a the your most wish
the fifteen member are not far from the a agreement to flexible the the conditions for closer cooperation
you you the october already on this issue discussed during the igc will the many the points solutions be found the in high extent with the the wish the this parliament
the minimum number member that part the a form the closer cooperation would must be the the eight while the possibility to appeal to do the the european council currently fact a type veto replace would must be by the right to issues the the item to to
the parliament has proposals done on the role the the must to the a community form the closer cooperation
this proposals will in recital be taken
a number member has the special nature the the cfsp stressed this countries are the opinion that the this form the policy special mechanisms the basis must are
with particularly the last days have this countries this point stressed we will this issue during the consultation the next sunday discuss
what the commission the areas there in biarritz two options the table the proposal to the number commissioners to a further to determine ceiling to to and the proposal to any member one commissioner the to let point
during the negotiations is however a third option to the has the perhaps the the wish the the various member meet can to
according this option must we the maximum number commissioners only the to to the the at that the union with a still further to determine number countries is extended
this the ceiling change moreover a the equality based system
this option must in nice seriously to be investigated and clarification the most delegations have moreover already indicated that they this possibility further want drafting
further is there about on the increase the the powers the the president the the commission and on a possible increase the the number vicepresidents
what finally the votes the the vote within the council the are there since the summit the biarritz also two options the table namely the the the double majority and the the the ordinary reweighting
there seems the a prefer for the ordinary reweighting the to signs although the precise conditions for a such reweighting course still must to be the i like i what this point the moreover careful up since a number countries here obviously still not final position on has welcome
there are several opportunities investigated
the the european council will end the decision must be long
on the redistribution the the seats within the european parliament there moreover still not agreement
the presidency has course your own proposal the table the this proposal is one the the two options the the table are
also what this point the will there in nice a solution must be found
to finally the this short presentation the the negotiations like i say that we progress have made what the the strengthening the article the the treaty in the future must this article to for in a system in case the a threat the the principles the the union
the proposal to in article a reference to the charter the the fundamental the to take is other by several member strong rejected this proposal was by the presidency during the igc the table the and was by the european parliament in are recommendation the november on signed
some member have even let know that a such reference the  the the charter in risk would to
we regret this situation but we can there unfortunately not choice
to finally like i still what say on the court the justice
the work are as good if completed
all delegations are prepared the european parliament the possibility to offer to the opinion the the court in to win on a international draft
although the presidency has proposed to the european parliament accordance article the right to give to the the court in appeal to to has a number delegations the my opposition
i like here as level for the the start to the this very important council a as objectively possible picture give the the situation
as you know want we in nice a good agreement achieve this can course not without compromises to the
this compromises must however the constructive the nature are the state government and ministers will in nice all necessary time for this negotiations allocate
they have to this reason even let know that the council can going to sunday if that that this need is
if the union like continue can function after the new enlargement with the countries the the currently the their accession prepare will there a agreement found must be this is because the essential important for the future the the union and the the the countries
during the european council the nice will also other important issues the table be the the french presidency has the optimum for this issues used
i think the in the first place the the charter the the fundamental
the does i pleased that the european parliament the by the convention among draft with majority majority has approved
also the state and government have the in biarritz behind this text supported
all conditions are now than also present to this charter officially by the three institutions in nice to let present
we have therefore our task fulfilled the the the european council the cologne is the the union has now on a strong evident which the clear way the rights and values which they believe are mentioned
after nice will we further our mind can let to on a any legal conditions the this charter this thinking with moreover in a wider debate that the longer term on the future the the union must to be held
during the european council will further about be on the progress the the the negotiations on the accession and therefore the enlargement are made
you you this fact itself the october a debate held
as you know has the french presidency the commission already in july asked to the pace the the negotiations the to to order the the problems at to to also have we the commission asked a exactly overview to give the the progress the by any candidate are made and per candidate the to give what problems there must be resolved
we have the this way a  the this process want give and a method want the for the next period
during the council general affairs the november have we a very good debate held the basis the the excellent documents the the commission the the council had sent
there is i i in large extent positive responded the the intensification the the negotiations i think than also that we the basis the the in helsinki the principles during the next council general affairs and the subsequent european council a clear and ambitious line can up for the followup the the work order the desired result to achieve
the european council the nice will be preceded by a summit the the european conference
the ministerial level has there just in sochaux a such conference place
during the summit the nice will we with all countries the opinion can exchange on the institutional reform the the union and on the prospects in the general the europe
your president is course for this debate invited
i like the unique and valuable nature the the european conference stress during this conference will because the representatives the the current member and the the the countries the one table include
i hope that we in the future still more can benefit the this experience with particularly very we the conference also for other european countries opening
i like briefly like the the european defence the important decisions the to the the the debate on the report taken will be will during the european council be discussed
during the european council the nice will will that the french presidency priority the the economic and social issues and the all issues which the union specific the the ensure the the european citizens meet can to
this priority have we express made during the many statements the we in this parliament have made
in lisbon and feira is there under portuguese presidency the economic area moreover already a number agreements made
this agreements had be fulfilled i think the the the efforts the the union the had make to its policy in service to to the the growth and the promotion the the employment
during the european council the lisbon are there guidelines approved the promotion the the innovative and competitive force the the european economy
the is the with particularly to a enrichment the the broad guidelines for the economic policy and a better following the the directives for the employment
there will than also report be issued the the european council on the performance the the the area the the employment the innovation the economic reform and the social cohesion must be made
also must there directives for the employment and a package employment autumn the the european council to be sent
as you know is there the the council the ministers the economic affairs and finance last monday a crucial agreement achieved on the harmonisation
on this issues was already months as not years discussed and some member have the always very reluctant up
all fifteen member have the this point therefore very important progress made and the european council the here note the
also the economic area is there there the considerable progress the social dimension the the european europe is a undeniable supplement the the economic dimension and must therefore its up to to
to the reason was after lisbon the adoption the the social agenda if a the the priorities the the french presidency
the presidency has all involved institutions invited that like say your parliament the economic and social council the committee the the regions the european social partners and many intergovernmental organisations to a contribution to make the the the the the social agenda
this agenda the moreover for a important part are origin take in a communication the the commission is yesterday by the council employment and social policy approved
the is therefore a good week for the european employment
in the social agenda be the objectives and the to take initiatives for the next five to ten year in the briefly reiterated with particularly what the the law the social protection the social mobility the permanent education and the fight against discrimination and various forms the exclusion
the agenda will be sent and to we course hope in nice be confirmed
in the programme the the french presidency is further special attention spent the the protection the the rights the the workers within the company and the improvement the their working
the the european council will reference be made the the progress the are made the the negotiations on the directive on the inform and consult the workers and the plan on the european company for far this issues still not regulated are to my sorry must we because see that there sticking opposition against the plans the this area there
after the summit the lisbon had the french presidency the moreover also a more europe the the knowledge the objective the
what this point the has the council a action approved that provides in the lifting the the obstacles the the mobility the students lecturers and researchers assignments
this action will the the european council the nice be sent
you see therefore that i certainly not experiences with my statement that the agenda the this council important and particularly good too is
also has the council indicators the to the progress to measure the the implementation the the action eeurope the for the a for everyone accessible society what in the conclusions the feira the called
a overview the the actions the the presidency the this area has taken will during the european council the nice presented be
also is consumer in increasing extent a source the concern for the citizens the europe to reasons the not further explanatory need
the french presidency had the the objective the the precautionary more to formulate
this is directly the beginning the the presidency a group set and the resolution the of the result is will tomorrow by the council internal market dealt be also again with the view the the european council the nice
a very topical subject is the food on this issue and with particularly on the institution the a independent european authority will than also length discussed be by the state and government in nice
a another point that the citizens the europe still more ensure concern is the safety the the roadrail a issue the issue with the growth the the maritime the with the necessary problems by is
during the council transport the october is in this the a first package measures adopted and the european council the biarritz has knowledge taken the the report the the commission on the need the supplementary measures
i know that the european parliament the now concerns with the first package measures and the is you know that the member the the large important consider that the proposals soon be adopted
without favour to want do the the infinitum the the parliament has the presidency than also a call done to this measures as possible early the implement to to
in nice will a new political impetus the the whole matter given must be with the view the the last council transport the and december because the is course not as that the french presidency the the summit the nice end
the french presidency has the desirable considered the to the the the revision the the communication the the commission from on the services the general economic important to discussions the the role the the public services or to the now many term to use the services the general important in europe
the presidency has the fundamental principles want ratify the the basis are the the policy the the community the this area the is the in the first place to the freedom the the member their public services to own insight the to to and in to up under respect the the provisions in the treaty
this principles will be down in a statement the as is the intention the the presidency if annex the the conclusions the nice adopted will be
the finally the there with the view the the european council work the a statement on the economic social and cultural aspects the the sport which also the social function the the sport in europe the mentioned is
you see that we in nice very many to discuss will have
course the your president the opportunity the positions the your institution the regard the all mentioned issues to the to to and course the they also the opportunity on in debate to act with the state and government
mrs the president mr the minister gentlemen members next week is in nice the european council meet
this summit is for the state and government a historic opportunity the they not over should let to
during the summit can namely a large number issues be dealt the timetable for the enlargement the consolidation the the process the lisbon a social agenda and the formal the the the charter the the fundamental
that are important points but today like i i up the the important decisions the in nice taken must be as you has proposed
in the first place the need the intergovernmental conference the to the with a treaty with a real added in the second place our security with the to crisis and if last the need to to plans how we after nice further to
in the first place must there therefore a new treaty be approved
the most objective the a new treaty is to ensure that the union also after the enlargement can continue function
on not already to long time must our institutions the originally for six member were intended because almost five time as many member manage
the this enlargement without unprecedented must we us prepare
problems the in nice not be resolved will our progress among
we questions the the countries that they for the accession the all criteria meet therefore must also we our promises fulfilling do
that means ensure that the union effective and democratic decisions can take the the the expectations the the european citizens meet
during the whole last winter has the commission many effort done to from to to why and the what points the original agenda the the intergovernmental conference had be extended
with particularly in us writing opinion the end january have we the minimum indicated that according us necessary was to the conference to let succeed
to my pleased can i now the that the negotiators almost to agreement are has on the provisions on example the closer cooperation the court the justice and the democratic values from article i i also the that the european political parties more involved are the the democratic decisionmaking the the member and the our institutions
i i the impression that we a reasonable compromise can achieve on the composition the the commission and on the votes the the vote in the council
the conference can this a agreement achieve that the the expectations the the large and the small countries meets the condition that we a number fundamental principles in eight take
how members the commission also the the most is that the president all necessary powers has to the college effective to lead
and how the votes the the vote in the council also amended the we must guarantee that there not decisions can be taken the against the wish the the majority the the member like
the best and simplest way to that to regulate is the system the the double majority also already are we us aware the the large problems the that can that
like for like to we in the good direction
there is however a point which the lack the progress i large ensure concern to the believe the our both institutions is that the most issue the we previous the the enlargement must solve the decisionmaking the qualified majority
to to ensure that the union effective can action must the conference the considerable progress make that means also that the codecision more must be applied
 clearly for the that the member the political given difficult find the veto the to give the sensitive issues if the social policy asylum and immigration the common policy the cohesion and tax affairs even when the only but is to technical changes to the internal market better to let function
if however everyone the are position remains is that for us all the worst solution
the mathematics and fifty year experience show because level the that the even the a small enlargement many difficult the a unanimously agreement to find
in a union with or more member will any progress blocked be in all sectors which unanimity requires remains
repeat the my words if we the veto for justice and home affairs maintain will the implementation the the programme that we in tampere have agreed serious be delayed or perhaps at on to to are
i will the state and government in nice downright say that they the this not illusions need to make
a the the sensitive sectors where i the on had is the policy
i like this still just the on continue are the sitting has there because the the that this issue special attention was in the agenda the today
as you know is the modern economy mainly based the services
the current standards write for that on few aspects the the negotiations on services with unanimity the vote the certainly because our treaties in first body  were for goods and not for services
the problem with the current policy is that progress almost always the back if we the continue the the unanimity the vote not only the services but also the goods the the negotiations is namely a large number sectors the the item including also services
our partners or competitors in some cases are there enthusiastic on because they can count the fifteen  and soon are that there thanks the enlargement still many more
the the still worse when a the the member conditions the sometimes financial conditions to agreement to to
the simple and logical solution is the current standards as the to apply that on all aspects the this negotiations also the services with qualified majority the certainly
that was also the dominant opinion during the conference unfortunately is the current text the the conference complicated  long and contains he two protocols
despite the length and the complexity is the text also very weak the is not the necessary simple solution for the simple problem where we already as long that struggling
for a good solution must still many work be opposition
the success the nice depends for us largely the the the conclusions on the decisionmaking the qualified majority
i will already the necessary do for a agreement with a added
you will us the morning after nice asked be or we satisfied are with the results
the commission will the this question law and without statement the words answers
during the next partsession in strasbourg will i the before the you all the sitting my opinion give or the comprehensive union the we all want achieve the or not effective can action
that is end us criterion for the success the nice
applause
in nice will further still important decisions be taken the the european union in the must to its responsibilities in the international community the the to take
the prevent the conflicts and crisis are areas which the community traditionally active is
in the light the the new ambitious objectives the the union is the our task our promises after to to
that means that the union the term in the must are autonomous decisions to take and when the nato not involved is the international crises must can respond with independent military operations under own directed
this is a fruitful cooperation between the european union the united nations the osce and the council the europe particularly useful
again that the not way that the nato for the involved member the basis remains the the collective defence the its members and a important role remains role the crisis
crisis means not only a ceasefire impose as we have given in kosovo
the means also the conflict parties from other the the citizens the the european union save and  a large number refugees respond food and medicines make the rule maintain and end after the chaos the upon restore
crises break almost never the today the tomorrow from they are usually the point the a process which the tension in a country or a region still further is behind
a the the most objectives the us common foreign and security is than also the tension reduce and prevent that the in a armed conflict end
this the the community already since long a large number instruments the available
almost already our programme programmes for support the third countries are example intended to democracy and stability to support
what we must do is the programme programmes better coordinate and more make the commission working the this at the internal measures this
the commission is that convinced that crises only consistent and efficient can be tackled with a integrated approach that is need to to ensure that the union its role the the international stage can play
to the crises the to can act must the community let see that they more can respond but the a way the in agreement is with the institutional framework that in the treaties is down
course must we work with the other institutions and with the high representative for the cfsp
however must we now decisions take on that framework because there is not worse at than a crisis to tasks and responsibilities the to to
minister védrine mentioned example the inclusion the the charter the the fundamental in the community right further the reform the the treaties the on the the existing texts to the objectives and the working the the union more the the public to present a clear distinction between the powers the the union and the the the member and the finally the issue the the balance between the institutions the the european union in the spirit the the community model that already with success the time has see that last is a but secondary aspect if i the tone the the debate and the perspectives for the future the europe good understand
we have doubt still many to do after nice but the must we us later deal
let we us now up the the near future under the french presidency and us concentrate the our priorities the end the nice and the enlargement
applause
mrs the president mr the president the the commission mr the president the the council best mr programmes mr the president the the council you the for a enormous task if presidency both if republic france
the was more than agree stressed and i endorse everything what the mr prodi has said that you the the area the the decisionmaking for a tremendous challenge the
if the reports you is the france that still hesitate to for the services in the framework the the trade on to to to decisionmaking
mr the president the the council how can you the germany expect that the concessions does the the area the the asylum and immigration
how can you the spain expect that the concessions does the the area the the cohesion
how can you the austria expect that the concessions does the the area the the policy
how can you the the united kingdom expect that the concessions does the the area the the tax policy if the presidency if the republic france not the good example the
i say you the you the good example so you the others to concessions can they
if the this level not acceptable result from the bus is will we not hesitate to after nice clear from to speak who this responsible is
further are we the opinion that you for areas where still not the have to decisionmaking now already in the treaty can into that with a unanimously decision and with respect the a certain term the decisionmaking can be introduced if that the in the treaties the included is there not time a revision the the treaties with a long ratification need
you has about on the codecision the the european parliament
that would must be introduced the all areas which with qualified majority the decided
but that must than also apply for the fundamental issues the the common agricultural which already decisionmaking applies the regard the the reweighting the the vote in the council the ministers am i the expressly agree with what the president the the commission has said
the mr prodi said that the double majority a democratic system would are the would however also for france acceptable must are to in a talking accordance the relationship to a other member that to roads
we have a reweighting the the vote need the avoided that a majority the the member the not the majority the the population represent a decision can a here must a clear democratic principle apply
and now the commission
we have with surprising  that the large countries the last months a political the the selfdefinition the regard the the commission have held the understanding arrived in our group not the i but was often by members from smaller countries leinen
the large countries thought that they the small under pressure could to to the their representative in the commission the to see
mr the president the the council here is on to talk but the is unthinkable that the small countries their commissioner would give as the his the the president not the strengthened and as this not the competence has to the example a commissioner from are his to people
first must the commission be strengthened if community body if you that  and the subject that we not no in purely intergovernmental cooperation and if you the commission strengthened than can we there the a day on give how we a new procedure introduce
but let we to all time the dignity the the small countries respect because the small countries are bear the the decisions and countries the the big in the history the europe always the child the the account been therefore say i you let we the dignity the the small countries respect
applause
what the closer cooperation the am i the with you agree
we are welcome that the record the the agenda are withdrawn also our british friends the the the level the the institutional development a very another position joining than the majority the our group and however good friends continue parts our opinion that this record there not must to and that everything according the community procedures must be facilitated
the involvement the the commission must guaranteed are the parliament must influence can exercise and no must be excluded
to finally the charter
the majority the our group is the opinion that the charter not only solemn must be become but that the european right must be
i know that the in nice unfortunately not far will to but a formal proclamation is however a first step
the next steps must than follow
we will in nice to a result to but mr the president the the council if we not further to than a minimum result than has president jacques chirac rightly said that we than not to a treaty will to
if the result not sufficient ambitious and a bad treaty is a minimum result that the enlargement the the european union fact not possible makes than would the in nice must admit that the has fail the task would than must be passed the sweden and then the belgium so hope a result the achieved that a extremely basis can are for the enlargement
we wish that there in nice a result the achieved but that must a ambitious result are i hope that you that  and that there clarity is on what there after nice is done the example the regard the the fundamental planning the europe and a competences the powers what does the european union and what do the member
also that have we in the future need
still a last comment and i say this not to disagreement to good in january i i in strasbourg françois mitterrand seen the to your  part
what i today the day wrong the are  if i the  in your country watching is the european enthusiasm the françois mitterrand
this enthusiasm wish i you to so we in nice a result to that good is for everyone in europe
applause
i am the our with president prodi agree that this a historic opportunity is the we not should let are the summit the nice has a responsibility towards europe
this summit must the partly a contract out that we last december in helsinki have concluded we must do what we the have promised
in helsinki are against the countries in europe two things said
we have the the door the the enlargement two concluded made
the one is that the countries itself the acquis community must accept and out this task parts they with us
the second finally the the door is that ourselves if fifteen member the fundamental need must recognise to our method such to change that we effective can continue work and even still more to work than we the this at do
that is the inevitable minimum for nice the is a extremely important and central objective
we if parliament will the the end the that process must decisions or we the the result that our approval can attach
this is a enormous responsibility
i am behalf a group the a declared favour is the the fastest achievable enlargement the the european union
we will very carefully listen to what the mr prodi and the commission in its whole the their analysis the the treaty the nice to say have and also to the openness the he promises
we will the results also itself in all openness analyse
i i a appeal the you mr the presidentinoffice president to us if parliament a document for to to that the approval the this parliament worth is and that also right does the the tremendous historic challenge which we in europe are
the challenge is the reunification the us old continent the challenge the also a enlargement the a scale the its unprecedented not know this must nice us prepare
if you that not does late you europe in the abandoned this parliament can the are assessment the nice not allow that europe failed
i would the regard the a number specific points the first want say that my group the in this stage the the development the the european union still still a good point take that any member a member the the commission is this increase the legitimacy the the union
this issue must there however not to lead that the union bogged affects in a administration conflict between the interests the the large and the small countries us most objective must because the joint european important are
my group feels the this at the most for a new weighting the double majority you you however explained that other issues the the agenda are
we are for a closer cooperation but we insist there the the the that you this not to many the advance out also must the cooperation for everyone open not exclusive are and based are the and component in the acquis community
we attach very the the charter the the fundamental and want than also not that the remains to in fine words
if we the if something important want can present must the somewhere in anchored are we favour there still still for the to law in article
we recommend you the the charter content importance to give also already is the in that case still not fully enforceable
we are behind the revision the article because the  the need of the has demonstrated
nice is a test to to see or us old european continent ready is for a new enlargement the continental scale
i think the that this can succeed but we have your presidency need mr the presidentinoffice president to the council in the yet to to for europe you must the council the nice inspiration to something to the to to that really the historic important is
constructive compromises as you that itself mentioned are not enough there must important successes be made
we will the hurdles high to and i hope that we together council commission and parliament that biggest can up
i say here today that we if the this standard the rapist and the hurdles to low the the the result not in recital will take and that we that in the important the europe and with a good conscience will do
mrs the president the most objective the the summit in nice is the enlargement the the european union and the preparation the the union this
i can also behalf my group say that we us fully linked have the a as quickly possible accession the the countries
the is however the important already in this stage to discuss what there after nice must done
the are visions need and the visions are the last months than also to the the
our group welcomes the to that the european treaties  be that the also in that the revision the the treaties in all openness must done and that the civil the that process the involved
we find the charter the the fundamental a success
the text must however after nice still be improvements
doubt the the charter the den duration part the the european constitution
we would however also want see that in article the the treaty on the european union the at least a reference to the charter the the fundamental the included because the citizens now already the the charter must can benefit
what the soon to take decisions the can we the important the decisionmaking the qualified majority not enough stress
the summit in nice can not success be if the number decisions the qualified majority not increasing
the is very important that the european parliament through the codecision a central role remains play because otherwise the acts still difficult to understand will are the european parliament the for transparency the the decisionmaking
take example the environmental if we on the  debate have we often criticism the the fact that the united states their sovereignty not want give and not international agreements on assumption want the
in us central are the however member the also the their socalled sovereignty continue to and the example if the on environmental is not to decisions with qualified majority want move
this must we the the
president prodi were the trade the there
we want probably all that the european union a important role in the still more  world plays but president prodi our group the if condition for more powers for the commission that the trade open and transparent the because this there the currently the
the finally like i also say that the the this at the important is ensure to ensure that the european union not only a community the the large member the
the aware that the future extent the the parliament not categorically to hundred members can be limited because the the way also the diversity in the parliament will reducing has us for problems the because as such reduction would to lead that we the on direction the a  and that is not democratic
i i a appeal the the mr barón barón to this understanding for to have because i the feeling i that the other presidents the objective to the extent the the european parliament in certain extent open to let the support
that would a important position the the parliament are and on can we tomorrow vote
mrs the president mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission i am the opinion that the governments the the fifteen member far little honour have know to achieve
the euro  the risk the the bse the in a  across and again been the union the for the the challenge in its history but in place the the urgent problems dynamic the to tackle are the governments behind closed doors struggle in  wording on the socalled leftovers the amsterdam
in nice refers the at the the truth
the summit can only a success be if the decided to a really extensive reform the the institutions and if there a strong signal the based that the union to enlargement in the is
this requires a efficient and closer commission the its task if driving the the integration can up
the requires further a balanced relationship the the vote the the large and the small countries in the council and that decisionmaking in the council the rule the also for central policies if tax social domestic and justice
the strengthening the the democracy requires course that the the european parliament the this areas the codecision the granted
a successful summit the nice means however also that the charter the the fundamental not only the become
i think the quite that a number governments the inclusion the a reference to the charter in article the the treaty simply the table has aside
as my mr programmes just like i stress that a reference to the charter in the treaty for i just as essential is if a broad social debate with our citizens
mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission the union has not need the a military force and a billions  programme for the modernisation the the when
or nice a success or a failure the will especially be measured the the question or the governments the ensure and the needs the the people last seriously take
the is good that thousands in nice the streets the will to to active a social europe to demands
the european union must the highest political priority give the the fight the the largescale unemployment the poverty and the social exclusion
i note that the french presidency the the council the this like working but mr the minister say your mr programmes that not words counted but action
mrs the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council one week for the european council the nice must we the that there still not many clarity there on the institutional decisions the this taken will be
probably will in the last night agreements made be on a number measures which not real discussion possible is been in our national parliaments the will then the asked be a and another to ratify because a compromise now once inevitably is
that is not good method
confusion there there with particularly on what i if the most issue consider the any enlargement the the decisionmaking in the council
in the first place article on the free movement the people and the immigration
the the creation the the treaty the amsterdam was agreed that this subject five year issue would continue but as usually be agreements again agree not fulfilled
we are although the opinion that international cooperation absolutely necessary is but we find the completely unacceptable that decisionmaking the majority used the to a or several member to force to the do the concessions in this type 
here must to a other way sought be a flexible method which more respect there for each decisions the method the the differentiated cooperation
the other point which still many confusion there is the enlargement the the community procedures the article to negotiations on international agreements on public services intellectual property and investment
the this at the negotiations on goods already under the community pillar but the commission must the this area than the with one voice speak the the voice the to little control exercised by the states
what disastrous consequences that can have is the has during the uruguay
let we a such shortly now not again committed by the short term a new multilateral agreement on investment to the or by after seattle the  to reopen
the first what we now must do the the area the the policy is not the decisionmaking the majority enlargement but the about the the council on the commission restore and the national parliaments actually a provision role transferring
short mr the president the the council matters the the this line
let we first but agree ensure for more democracy and us up the restoration the the monitoring by the member then can we further talk on the transfer the powers
mrs the president i take the floor behalf the radical members the the group
mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission i i the impression that all speakers also the last the a position its that proscribe  is the the own to same conclusions are has the the eve the the summit the nice is there not only not agreement in sight but the problems are by this outdated method the the intergovernmental conferences only but greater become in place the smaller
that applies certainly for the charter the the fundamental the the vote on have we us abstained precisely because we knew that you the after the summit the nice probably in a la would to after you our peoples had freshness that the a binding document for the defence and the promotion the the fundamental was
you you the not agree in the treaty into that shows that this text and the treatment that unnecessary were
we make us ensure what there the the commission will be the driving the the european integration with twenty twentyfive thirty members the that you a administrative service a technical secretariat the the council a body without opportunity the even but a minimal role in the institutional balance that the more the the union for view had
on the decisionmaking on the  will the demands the the parliament and the the public opinion to a democratic system a wider application the the decisionmaking probably paralysed be by mutual veto programmes
i address i to president prodi the rightly has promised that he us in strasbourg will say or the commission already than not effective will can action or the union after the summit the nice already than not effective will can action
president prodi you the part the the summit the nice you represents in certain sense the parliament that has are wish the a modest way express made in the document which tomorrow voted is be
that document the result the a compromise between the groups have we not signed mr the president makes you in nice your any express the you the responsibility not if the  the the period after nice but to in nice itself the european institutions to the effort to defend in the first place the commission and the parliament
mr the president the draft the the treaty the nice seems more the a constitution the a federal the than the a agreement between states
the laws the the union must mainly with qualified majority be adopted which all democracies in the member instrument can be
the treaty the amsterdam contains still provisions which unanimity applies
now the proposed for areas majority in to to
the concern is therefore not more rising
the competence the the union with the treaty the nice the is further than the level the the federal bodies in many federal states
now urges the by to the core the the national states with the introduction the majority on certain aspects the the social policy policy taxes reasons culture supranational parties and even us own salary so we the bureaucrats members the the eu in the member be in place the the members the the electorate in the european parliament the in their own country taxes pay
from apply also for the domestic and justice policy majority
by the trade seem the eu a the
in the wto must we with one  voice speak
also for the foreign and security will majority be introduced
only for defence is still unanimity requires
for the rest is the veto little for in the new treaty and countries without veto are earlier länder than independent nations
the internal level majority to outside to a common representation that is because the definition the a the
what there than still remains for the constitutional conference in is not the content but the example the a text the a real constitution can be this like say a text which first the charter the human and fundamental are included than the rules and than if annex the individual estimating the without difficult  amended can be
the only what there is democracy
the is under table cases
that is as in the treaties the maastricht amsterdam and nice
more majority which the voice the officials and ministers more material than the the the electorate and 
in a democracy is the just versa
the veto the the parliamentary democracies in the member is sacrificed the the majority but the eu the itself not parliamentary democracy
with the closer cooperation  also the veto on  not formally but the in the reality because a qualified majority future not account not to the with opposition example the denmark sweden and britain or other countries where the the undemocratic idea would can to to the electorate to their opinion to questions
the federalists to their sense with a farreaching integration and the governments in sweden britain and denmark can their country even in the cooperation  if once the decisions taken are the also for this countries in the practice binding are
the treaty the nice deprived the electorate so power that the as must be if a real constitutional amendment the only in force can act after the opinion the the citizens in a forthcoming is asked in the countries where this possible is
mr the president the title the this agenda the already the how important article is in the debate on the enlargement the the decisionmaking the qualified majority
the to to the enlargement that to the services is understandable but the has fact little from to are with the institutional reform if such and the must the priority be implemented the demand in paragraph the the joint resolution to also the investment in the powers the the area the the trade the to take has here still less that to make
with the view the the however rather low opportunity the success think i that the not intelligent the would are to the intergovernmental conference to taxation with a additional complicated and controversial subject
the is given the the the the negotiations namely doubtful or the extension the the summit to sunday including the traditional  the the  the enough to also the this area a sensible solution to achieve
mr the president mr the presidentinoffice mr prodi the most point for the  is a successful conclude the the igc
we find that crucial if a whole important step in the rapid enlargement the the european union
you must the proposals how in the countries the central and eastern look the to what what happening in nice
we have now just the elections had in romania where we shocked are by the outcome and the turnout the a very extreme party
we have beginning next year elections in poland and in bulgaria and how be you the population this in the countries area if the european union not in the would are to to a good treaty to to in nice
the european union mr the president has need the good news
a bad agreement is a proof that our government not priority attach the the enlargement the the european union
how can we invest to the the population in the european union more support to create for further enlargement if our own government not in the would are to to a good treaty to can to
but the is also a issue that the according our government demonstrated that there not adequate answer is the the large questions which we faced be in the european union
the bse the safety the foreign policy and defence the regard ability the europe the relation the the united states already that type questions can not more the national level be resolved
the is than also not answer the the  the the decisionmaking the here still still there within the european union
president europe has need the leadership has need the clarity has need the choices has need the inertia
that like the population fact see
if you see what confidence there undermined is with the to the euro than has the population the need to to see that we steps forward to
i think therefore that the french presidency a large task has to last to to  for nice
the is extremely sad that there a situation is the where large and small countries the relation the other are to to are
i think the a psychological mistake the the first item that there enormous many mistrust is created
i i urgent appeal the the french presidency to the to the effort in to effort that the gap the these because they is extremely research
the role the the commission is for us essential
the commission is and remains the driving and if the commission not from nice is in a closer position than is this a black day for europe
i think therefore that the is is that we less intergovernmental and more with the commission must to work
we will the results the nice assess the the question or the lead to more effectiveness more efficiency greater democracy and a greater transparency and that is the the item
the igc seems still still problems to have with the enlargement the the qualified decisionmaking in the council
perhaps must we therefore the emphasis shifting to the issue the the enlargement the the codecision with the parliament
the parliament has proven that the the the codecision in the cases which the currently the application is a adult partner is the the council
same applies for the drafting the the charter moreover would the very authorities are if the british prime blair this also public would recognise
the this at process the enlargement the the codecision not logical and also not according clear criteria
although the the previous treaty only progress is made the the enlargement the this formula is this also the silly formula the the codecision with unanimity introduced for affairs if citizenship social security rights the independent entrepreneurs and also cultural policy
the treaty the nice must the this practice a end make and the codecision enlargement to such thirty policy including competition agriculture and fisheries structural aid transeuropean networks research and development and also citizenship
basic questions on the balance are in the igc currently rather difficult the seems therefore certainly sensible if the igc the as quickly possible is up the better cooperation with the parliament the the promotion the the mutual confidence and the the development the a postnational european democracy
mr the president this are we than the the eve the a new european summit which many the us with thousands citizens the streets the nice the will to
just if they can we not influence exercise the the result the the negotiations
mr the president i concerned i really ensure on the outcome the the last  which usually who gaining the the best pressure is against the  and the  the last night the everyone as if the last opportunity to the unresolved problems the to solve
that is the  least democratic element the the intergovernmental method the  the the human the the  the the last at the the duty to to any price with results to to
i am afraid that there end a or other unfortunate provision arrive a senate the national members a  euro or a  wto a further reduction the the powers or a further marginalisation the the parliament or a another protocol as that on the wto that if the the adopted the commission subverted to a  the the line the very many different  the all in a other direction draw
who in nice the streets the is and part the the decades planned fora and meetings can devising the least one result to achieve that this the last igc is been that the  one on the future the europe the president védrine in nice the into in a give which the timetable and the methods be the to a democratic constitution for europe the to to and the to take
mr programmes a last thought on this parliament and on are  words the just only the let we a repeat the the embarrassing should the the the previous enlargement investiture try to prevent when the parliament the after months threats to the wish the the governments 
i hope that we that not still a time need that to make
mr the president i was a active  in the referendum on the treaty the maastricht in
as i the result the the treaty the nice see will i a position adopt but i am schizophrenic the the debates in this chamber
the one at like the the union closer the the citizens to and just later is the fully are with the construction the a european the the far from is the the wish the the citizens
to my opinion is the most agenda the the summit the nice the drafting the a was that the when and how the enlargement must place to find
we questions us to often the or the countries there ready for are and we lose from the view that example the  and structural enormous obstacles raise for the enlargement
if in nice decided the the countries the possibility to offer to the the next european elections part to take than would this the eu sufficient under pressure can to and can the enlargement reality be
mr the president gentlemen colleagues in are statement the may spoke robert schuman the next words the association the europe can not suddenly be implemented or by a comprehensive creation to the be the the united europe will must be built by means the specific congratulation which a actual solidarity if point will must be taken
the eve the the summit the nice seems i a appropriate at to after to to how the is the with this spirit the actual solidarity without this solidarity can there because the a authentic real european integration not there are
what the conclusions the the igc the is the clear that in nice a agreement must be achieved the the  force the the european institutions improves without the existing balance between the member and course also between the member and the union in risk to to
only already the fact that this issue to raised the the shows the that the policy the strengthening the the mutual  between the to the union against countries fail has
we are not the only the this opinion are agree the french presidency has the through the are minister pierre moscovici in a recent interview admitted that the attitude the with particularly president jacques chirac and minister joschka fischer this year the regard the the future organisation the the union have adopted the mistrust between the small and large countries considerably has do increase what inevitably consequences will have for the european council the nice
must i you in this respect remind the the proposal to the the axle  a group the leading countries together to to this option will the essence the europe indepth change and a dangerous confusion to the to between a healthy  europe one and a conventions europe with two or several speeds hand
in certain sense reflect the text the the joint resolution the here in vote will be the this feeling the inconvenience the is because to a expressed general text
also have the authors only view for the powers and narrowly the the european parliament although they the advance aware that this approach the risk the a political defeat only but increase they demands still more participation the the european parliament but was with not floor the the fundamental role the for the national parliaments is play
that the in stark contrast with the reality we know because all that the summit the nice intended is to the work the a intergovernmental conference the to conclude
well the involved governments to not responsibility the the the european parliament but the their respective national parliaments the is therefore clearly that this highlights the the treaties a expressed sovereign nature has
we expect that the conclusions the the next summit expression give the the various national wish the already one thing common have the unceasing search to cohesion and development
mr the president mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission in a discussion with this parliament has the president the latvia today quite  said we make us homework
the is implicitly the question by or the state and government the the european union also their homework make
that is very doubtful
already in amsterdam are the state and government continue are and now must the class in nice are year again
when the for the second time remains are than means that in any  a serious crisis i fear that a second time  to the opportunities one
i will a another picture use
the european integration is a  the last decades have we with success a large distance know the to to
the the level the the european integration to we now the the last right document
have we still on the necessary force and their or lose we the guidance that is the question where we in nice for are
i hope that we the force can people to the enlargement and a strong union to the to to and not a enlargement the the union weakened
from the position the the european union means this that the two conditions must be met
the first must the european union to act in the are and the by the enlargement the the decisionmaking the qualified majority and than course not the the level the policies where this not the particularly important is
i would policies can mention where we the decisionmaking can introduce the example the appointment the the members the the committee the the region programmes
but this can i stolen be if we the decisionmaking can introduce the five areas where this really something adds the example the the trade the social policy justice home affairs the structure or the tax policy to the most to mention
we ask the state and government their  document toys the to give so also the others distance do the their plaything so not everyone the other waiting and there nothing happening
because in this situation is the the intergovernmental conference however already months because no are plaything like give
i hope that the the beginning the the conference someone the force profitable to are plaything the to give and as the others under pressure to to to also concessions to do
the second the democratic deficit must not again grow
in amsterdam was agreed the codecision the the decisionmaking to link
if the this rule the from the in fight with amsterdam the democratic deficit increase
i hope that this not the case will are
further are there the this level still few leftovers from the past the must be corrected also the the area the the competition the monetary union and the agricultural must the codecision be introduced
we must the this intergovernmental conference also a balance find between small and large
i like that point that the population the represented by the european parliament and that must in the european parliament to expression to
when the difference between small and large in the council to large the must we fear that the european union within few years a  will currently the small countries will the not more home feel because they afraid are that they their identity not more can defend
if not the both conditions the met namely that the union to act in the remains and that the democratic deficit the reduced than would i i for the first in the european union the situation can the that the european parliament a treaty reject
applause the right and the the central
mr the president the commission constitutional affairs the this parliament has already from february with attention commitment and confidence with particularly in the french presidency the month to month followed what there the the intergovernmental conference  we are now the the eve the the conclude
there are what progress made what  achieved but let we honest are in the almost ten months the the intergovernmental conference are the positions on essential issues not closer the other has minister védrine and there is not agreement in sight to but not to speak the the fact that few by the parliament in the resolution the april provided issue programmes at not the the item are been example the economic policy and the institutional implications the the common defence
that is a serious the agree after to think on the confusion and the  the the followed method a long the  confrontation on mainly technical issue programmes in pending the clarifications and political  the are only very late started in october during the council the biarritz and that was the only time
the experience the this year have clear made that negotiations between representatives not the way are to the the constitutionalisation the the union to work after nice and with the view the the future the europe the method is as gradually towards
in nice must there not a new intergovernmental conference in the prospect be the apart the the intentions would a such announcement more misunderstandings and fear than assent and hope mobilise
the commission constitutional affairs has with the the november adopted resolution the her contributed they has the emphasis the the few points the really decisive are for the succeed the the conference
i will the now not repeat i like only but say that this points need are for those the convinced are the the need to further to to with the enlargement the the union and not want that the in the much affects or paralysed the
we start remind to doubt or the also the high level the aware what there the the stake the
mr the president the last time have we namely still more a worrying unlike see stand where but few governments the the cannot the unlike between the courage behind already taken decisions to continue are example the common currency the common defence the historic enlargement the the union and the unwillingness to the the institutional conclusions to draw
if this unlike a negative impact will have the the conclusions the the conference will they the whole european construction in a crisis landfill
than is a public crisis because there in nice not agreement the closed better and healthier than a  crisis a  laudace  to to conceal that the conference on the enlargement the the union the essential points is failed
president even paris is divided on nice
the french president and the first minister seem more obsessed by their own political future than the the europe
for far the french presidency consistent must whatever is the especially in lack the neutrality and way the the large member and that while the union more than ever need has the a consensus  president
to area to create for the newcomers must all member a little  but that do they only if the really not otherwise more can
the seems the or some governments the now already accept the a new igc for the enlargement
the governments are the urgency the reforms from the view lost because they the blind focus the the own power in the new relations
as stressed many country that decisionmaking rule must be and bears same so exceptions the that there per balance carry little remains
if majority not rule the the the decisionmaking you the as the mr prodi just rightly another
if this not by is with codecision the the democracy still further meaning
the weighting in the council must right do the the germans the the member and that means that there also between the greater and the smaller countries between best the any difference must are
during this round must all member one own commissioner retain
only then must we decisions on a new system the on the the than police experience
europe will how than also completely change and let we therefore therefore not anticipate the a situation the we now still not can out
the is very desirable to a hierarchy the to to in the commission vicepresident commissioners and 
this extends also the opportunities the us parliament to with  members the the commission to speak in place the with officials the actual texts read the they also the scriptures had can 
the charter deserves the not to in the vacuum to continue depend without clear status
by the text not in the treaty the to take but only political to support will there large legal  can the
therefore must the charter as quickly possible in a  be included
government concessions do the the next summit is not political defeat but a victory a victory the the new europe the the old
late there not shadow on nice the and late paris again the  are
mr the president i like the council and the commission and also this parliament itself remind the a resolution the we the october have adopted on the improve the the legislation
in this resolution made we for accordance the subsidiarity and the political and national diversity the the european union in the changes the the treaties specific the to take the recognition and respect the the political and legislative powers the the home political bodies the the member  states autonomous communities regions in their executive legislative and legal relations with the institutions
that aspect the the subsidiarity have we today in us debate still not heard the is however the large important
the has also the a very important way to make with the extent the this parliament
the peoples and regions the the parties the the european free alliance represent are very concerned on our plans to the introduction the a ceiling the members to combine with the idea the digressive proportionality they are afraid that the people the we here currently can represent in the practice in this parliament not more represented will are
that will a enormous loss mean for the european democracy this will the institutions further the the people the to to are in place the closer
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes for a person if i represents nice the hope the a new europe in institutional but also in political sense
yesterday has the italian parliament with large majority are approval adopted the a resolution on nice also the that that we the agree are on the objectives and the actions the nice
for us remains the the the fundamental important that the list with issues which with qualified majority will be certainly not the extended and that the principle the one commissioner per member the confirmed
a other fundamental factor is that the  the the national parliaments in the treaties included remains precisely because we the the way the construction the the new europe facilitate
the is clear that the ceiling the members not more can direction for a europe with institutional or twentyeight member that would to a unfair reduction the the number members for the smaller countries lead
the the other on is the important that us europe strong institutions has if counterbalance for the institutional vacuum that is the by the euro and the progress the economic area the of the result was
of benefit the nafta mexico canada the united states and the dollar
that said having must nice a historic council be for ourselves for our countries and for the future the europe
mr the president this is a visible parliament but the speakers the i in this debate are wrongdoings were the  all with other agree
i think that we all very concerned are on the outcome the the european council in nice
my good friend elmar brok said that we two examination had to amsterdam and nice
i am the not with him agree because i think that this issue many further back
i remind i that the institutional issues already the the enlargement the the the item were the
i remind i also a letter the chancellor kohl the us wrote that we the enlargement but had approve and that the rest than immediately would be resolved as said as done and the enlargement the was by
then were we the  under the occasionally leadership the posed westendorp when the treaty the amsterdam and now nice but there is practical nothing changed mr the president we are still still pressure with the institutional issues are without solutions to find which we a extremely ambitious objective if the enlargement to member can to
on make we us ensure and on makes everyone the afternoon has about the ensure
that is the message the we through you the the european council want transfer mr the president
you must know that we this french presidency not will assess the are ideas on services the general economic important how important that subject also is but the are mandate for the summit the nice
that mandate is right the that the finland remediation with the closer cooperation
two affairs are for the parliament the fundamental important
in the first place questions we us the how the decisionmaking will to and or the parliament always that will decide on the majority when the legislative the nature are
that is our first enormously
our second enormously mr the president is the charter the the fundamental
there are but little people the the for institutional affairs interest because the as complicated are
the people have however the interest for the charter the the fundamental which i already the very what places i can speak because people the understand and perceived what fundamental are
we think that we within the convention good work have done
i think that we a good charter have and that the council a enormous political opportunity late are the proclamation the you proposed and the my friend and chairman poettering formal proclamation as is namely a secret proclamation
you declared that we the charter have become and that was the than
you does if you there no that difficult you the
mr the president the the council this is the large political opportunity for this european council
if you the not used fear i that we you after the european council in nice again issues and that other presidencies follow the european parliament will than confines the the judgement the oscar wanted that the temptation can be resist by remind to to give in the temptation be the the treaty the nice to course time not good to approve
mr the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the president the the commission if nice behind the back is will quickly the at the the european parliament we the european parliament must than a answer give the two questions the the historic important are for both the future the the european union if its political credibility
officially is the objective the this revision the creating the complexities and for a extended europe suitable institutions and also the reduction the the goes democratic one
unfortunately the with the  the to now to the the intergovernmental conference from the bus is has or the one or the other objective achieved therefore the the not the the two by the european parliament the assessment met
because we the institutions more want let work have we asked in the decisionmaking the the council on to steps the unanimity to qualified majority course have we the all constitutional issues excluded
the results the the work to now to are however but to on to house to write as also the gentlemen brok and méndez the vigo just already clear among
the european parliament is also very disappointed on the large issue the the democratisation the the european union
democratic given is the course that decisionmaking with qualified majority in the council bound is linked with codecision the the parliament for far the least to legislation is
this is however not all the case
to now to is there example the the closer cooperation not there the assent the the european parliament with the opening the the relevant procedure
to finally refuses the not only the charter the the fundamental the to take in the text the the treaty but even towards to refer in article
i like course not bones that there also good elements are i think example the the european political parties and the article where we already the a and another on heard have
this progress are however not sufficient to us nice to do accept and course will there gentlemen mr programmes pressure the us be exercised so we nice nevertheless accept
the will risk with a institutional crisis if there in nice not treaty is
i fear however gentlemen mr programmes that if we if european parliament by the bowing to and a clear inadequate treaty if enough accept there a still greater crisis will arise
the national parliaments wait the us position
we have a historic responsibility
let we prevent that the the disappointment the us in nice to wait the if this nothing from the bus is the large disappointment the added the our peoples the result the our attitude
a failure in nice can always still be corrected but a loss the credibility the us parliament will deep encourage draw encourage the years  will will to are
a european union without a credible parliament can not long life are suffered in any case will this a bad life are
mr the president the debate on article and the trade must part of the a many wider attempt to to to to greater transparency and democracy in the decisionmaking the the eu on the trade
this sector is currently a the the most centralised and opacity policies
this was a the the points the criticism the the demonstrators in seattle and that will the also in nice still still are
many the us find that we only should to think on communitisation the powers the member to the commission after a full restructuring the the policy and the  the the eu if whole this must many democratic and transparent be and they must be based the real social and ecological sustainability
the is therefore not only a issue the a many greater role the the parliament the the decisionmaking the the area the the trade
that is course the important and i taken i there than also on that this aspect not by others to the is the because in the commission has this many the our time in up taken
the means however also that the committee itself completely must be changed the must many better be be are agenda and conclusions must good accessible are and the must a broad composition to which many different favour in represented are
only than president prodi will some the us prepared are the commission the extremely important areas the services investment and intellectual property to to confidence
mr the president the  in nice will to i hope a next positive step mean the way to european integration
i must say that the recent report the the commission on the progress the the countries in central and eastern the the membership the the eu have requested encouraging is
i like absolutely nothing difference the the aspiration and even the right the some the the countries to in to the community to to act the would however to my opinion not in their own important are or in that the the member to this date to maintain if not first is taken for a orderly transition with a minimum the distortion the the economies the the existing member
we should not forget that us final objective is a economic and social environment to create which the eu a the the most players can be in the trade the will the countries the central and eastern if full partners participate and will they also the results them the a peaceful and stable european economy
we have in the past proven that this objective reached is if capita the a member the has benefited the a carefully planned transition to membership see i a extended and peaceful europe than also are confidence meet
the enlargement the the european union must however the influence the the smaller member with their important national interests the must be strongly not weaken
from the irish position see is the clear that we us right want retain to a member the the european commission for to to the commission rules because the implementation the the common agricultural the fisheries the transport and other important runup
i think the also very important that we control the on our own taxation and the social security
mr the president i address i in the french to the president the the commission and the president the the council to there certainly the to are that i good understand am
i like here the attention draw the a idea that by my group in our group the the european party to the is the and not like the the points the concern the my if conservative know disposal group
the many the points have we to different reasons large reservations with particularly the regard the the charter the the fundamental
on will i however not speak that will a other speaker do
the idea that i to the like to is us to concentrate the what there after nice will done
from the speech the president chirac here in july taken has can we made that there in nice the least three theme programmes will are the simplification the the treaties the distribution the the powers between the european national and regional  what i with a reference to article the the american constitution the rights the the states would want mention and the institutional balance
we expect the the commission a report on this issue the good administration
would the not good are our peoples to consult before further to to and they to involve the what we here do in place the to wait the a result which the citizens the then in a referendum must express without that they exactly know what there agreed is
my next yerushalaim question reads than also the what way and according what timetable will the to work to in this issue what procedure will there followed be and what countries to a voice in the procedure
in the first place the timetable mr the president must we to the next igc that like say to or wait to the debate on this fundamental issues to can to
i i must we directly after end the the summit the nice a beginning make with this debate
in the second place the procedure
the president the our commission constitutional affairs has right forget the igc forget the way men forget the closed doors
we must in europe a large social debate the the to by the citizens the our discussions to involve
and what the third point the the question to the participating countries the countries must certainly the the matter involved be but the seems i somewhat excessive the countries which still not negotiations be held as turkey a voice to give
the conclude would i you want questions mr the president the the council and mr the president the the commission after to think on the mechanisms the in the treaty the nice included must to be to to guarantee that this broad debate indeed held can be and to  situation to prevent which all decisions behind closed doors taken be the mechanisms must the us also possible make a impetus to give the the discussion on a new already than not constitutional european framework directly in contact to to with our electorate and the the european union in the future a large success to make
mr the president i would not only the presidentinoffice president the the council but also all governments the the member remind want remind that already this delicate issues us will continue head if there in nice not agreement the achieved
they will after nice not easier can be contrary this will precisely difficult be
in the next two weeks will than also the conclusion still a enormous effort need are
this applies for not few issue much if for the decisionmaking the qualified majority
any government says that there more decisionmaking the qualified must to but they have all their own listing with exceptions
the problem is that we if we all  with exceptions addition other to to the discovery to that there still but little content important areas on are which we with are all find that they under the decisionmaking the qualified majority must to the
if we in nice something want achieve will we all some the our  exceptions must madam
course will some governments in their own member criticism to the opposition the eurosceptics the say you the us national veto the
you must however good understand that if you itself veto you all others that also have
in a union the member will than also for any veto that you  also other reawakening be given
the will affairs the you really you not longer be  by the reawakening the others
everyone is there the a system the qualified decisionmaking the forward
if we more qualified decisionmaking want to the the area the the legislation must that incompatible with codecision this applies not only for new areas the under the qualified decisionmaking to the but also for areas the that now already do
this is essential for the democracy the eu
new in to to european legislation must the two demands meet they must acceptable are for the elected governments meet in the council and for the directly elected members the the european parliament
this are two guarantee for the quality and the desirable the the european legislation
this is not something to afraid for to are
the way which the codecision in the last year has successful shows the that this procedure working
in more than threequarters the the cases have we not agree the conciliation need the two readings both in the council if in the parliament are sufficient to to agreement to to
if this here as good working let we there than for ensure that the for the whole spectrum the the process working
the finally is there still the issue the the number seats in the european parliament
we know that there like there in a parliament be elected a final solution achieved must are the in elected parliament will because  to
against the time are we doubt extended to least member
but we will also must ensure for a transitional for the elections in since the are least few new member will join before or during the term the the parliament that in the elected and that to will 
we must now already area make for the enlargement the that parliament
if there many states join will we perhaps the border the temporary exceed we must however now already a first adaptation changes
the is because easier to in this respect two small steps to to than one large step i request the president than also urgent are to the and i call also all governments the to in nice the necessary compromises to the
mr the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the president the the commission gentlemen mr programmes just spoke mr elmar brok in this chamber on homework
he said what schoolchildren must do to by the  to to
a the the things the schoolchildren certainly must do to to succeed is briefly for the beginning the the  very the issue still just soon scanning
i will you say what issue programmes you still agree by must take to a ten to to for your 
the first will mr the minister in nice and this say i against you and through you against already your mr programmes a agreement must be achieved that not only the power between large and small but also the institutional balance respects
what the second the issue the the commission the know you and know we all that the the not to figures is
the the issue the the commission is the to quality
we want a new commission with commissioners provided this commission a political role again a political role can role and a president the with powers the its in the to to properly to work
what the votes the the vote in the council the seems i the system the the double majority the best this is the most representative and the most objective system
what the enlargement the the qualified majority the are we the there that agree that if not steps in the direction be the there very many problems will the
i i would the the way the first step the sector the the trade under the qualified majority can to this seems i even course
what the foreign policy the now we however in the fine world the the mr solana life must i you say that we a large mistake committed if we the common foreign policy continue aside for only intergovernmental cooperation
the common foreign policy must whole subject be the the community procedure because only the the way will we the necessary safety can intrusion
to finally can also i mr the presidentinoffice president not silent on the charter this is a issue where millions european citizens lively interest for who
i i must the in nice least agree with the compromise the the parliament and the charter combine with article member
mr the president i would my speech want focus the three essential points
the president the the council has the used on the issue the the closer cooperation he has said that this almost a consensus is achieved
i would like the president presented védrine or president romano prodi know what role there for the commission is play or the defended in the framework the the closer cooperation in the second and third pillar
my second comment has the the the general agreement the my friend and president the the socialist group enrique barón barón here already has analysed they will fortunately part of the the resolution the the european parliament tomorrow doubt will adopt
currently is the distribution the the powers within the council and the parliament not in agreement with the size and the population the the different member
the current balance is based the the principle the double legitimacy between the union the states and the union the citizens
i presiding however from the different interpretations the that the the intention is this balance to upset and more weight to to know the the large countries both in the council if in the parliament
that is completely unfair and unacceptable
therefore emphasise i again that the the decisionmaking in the council the rule the the double majority must be applied that is not only reported but also fairer while in the european parliament the current method must be maintained
as the new members join can a beginning be made with the proposed from removal this  seems i balanced and fairer
also the the account with a historic reality the the architects the europe not on the head should see the member there now once and the link between the member and their citizens will continue as the link between all citizens and europe itself not the mentioned
to finally would i still just want like the the charter the the fundamental
the president the the council is sincerely been and i thank him this
he has us that greatest that there countries and governments are the refuse the charter even but to  if the in the treaties the included
this type statements is unacceptable
what will the european citizens the not think when he should say that the governments prepared are certain things the to write but not wish that same things binding and enforceable are
what for signal give we the the countries when we the them expect that they with the view the the accession the already our demands in the with the single accede but not more insist the the ratification the the charter the the fundamental
the the way give we to know that europe the consumers better deals than the citizens the the european union therefore repeat we our call the the presidency
the must everything in the work to to ensure to ensure that in nice the least a reference to the treaties the included that is because the best pay for the commitment the the european members the commission and the representatives the the governments the the the convention for the drafting the the charter have part
mr the president today has the president the latvia a visit the the the european parliament
the story the mrs   is interest for the courage the the peoples the central and eastern in times the adversity have shown
if  up had they its country from for the  red army they had the if refugee in concluded hide to not by  to be people
i like you also remind the the  the the trade solidarity in poland the president the the czech republic pm havel and the generations in hungary the after the still have tried their freedom and independence back to to
minister védrine one see we courage and even  behaviour hand look we to the council the ministers the igc the soon meet will to in nice see we this courage million determination to there a success the to make
as you in your speech said see we the this at only divided between muck and the prospect the a failure
will you in nice respond can give the the resolution the the european parliament which we call ensure to ensure that the summit as carefully the prepared that the peoples the central and eastern the the next elections for the european parliament the that can vote will you president prodi and your mr commissioner verheugen the commission requiring the countries to to let the have met the everything what we to now to the they have asked
only than can we in nice the peoples the central and eastern right in the view look and say yes we are the managed the necessary reforms by to to
we can us not failure afford
we were time the the leftovers after amsterdam
us public in the eu and the public in the countries will the prospect the leftovers after nice the a second igc in not accept
i hope that we the french presidency will can congratulate with are success if success however social will our condemnation hard are
president the the first face is nice on the necessary adjustments and leftovers in the light the the enlargement
but there the many more the the stake
nice is not only on the question or member their commissioner want give the is especially on the willingness the the member to a european political cooperation giving to give the on the national interests across the interests the the european citizens addresses
we have the last time regular can see that this political cooperation total present was
a striking example is course the national motivated measures the response the the disquiet on the high diesel and  that a joint action in the view the the citizens the credibility the the european political cooperation enormous had can increase
with the deepening the the union for view must the government in nice than also minds and the qualified decisionmaking substantial enlargement
if the us seriousness is with the strengthen the the european cooperation there also the absolute need to the democratic control the the european decisionmaking good to regulate
therefore must the qualified decisionmaking always be linked the the  the the parliament
the all amendments the the european parliament in the last period were adopted by the council
therefore apparently is there a tremendous qualitative contribution the our on
as mr berès said has is the course a unsustainable distinction that we the the one on  have the pertaining and same only but  the decisions
think we just back the the recent bse
what must we now on the our citizens explain
mr méndez the vigo has just rightly out the the charter
that subject is course the european parliament very the the heart
the the hands and being the the europe the the citizens charter for the fundamental the the citizens
but now that charter in nice in treaties must be included have various governments apparently their opposition let will
this is for us unacceptable because by this document the to take in the treaties the the european union be fundamental standards and values the the rule and the social state component in the european structures
i like warn for a considering minimalist attitude by our government in nice
as president prodi has said is the qualified  together with the codecision article link charter with the treaties the test the our government
in netherlands have we a saying that says if you the hurdles to low the there you agreed
us european project must this on not 
if we  the european parliament will the reject
therefore we count the a success but the is the you that this from to to
president we should these days however the large admiration express for the united states
they are in the the constitutional crisis the they in hundred year have had and they say only but the that how good us system in other is that we such crisis can have
if we but something the the mentality would have that we something less emphasis would to the the things the wrong to in us continent and something more the emphasis would can to the the things the good to than would we a document happier are than the the at the case is
i am the agree with everyone the said has that the council examination must do
i i also my scepticism
i hope that they indeed what do what elmar brok them has urged
if they that do than make they there a success the
if the not the case is than make they there not success the
in the particularly applies that what i the also for the social policy and also for the charter that the the the a or other way in the treaty recognised is be
but why is the now however as that we the always as many worse think to do although there not objective reasons for are than others
i think that that partially however a certain uncertainty is the us parliament also the the council and also the the commission the the to the to the the message but the the other on however also a certainly result is the the attacks and the  attacks the the side the the socalled sceptical
they have nothing to offer
what they offer is a balkans that is something what the worst is
the balkans is the ideal the the sceptical
if we the mr bonde hear the balkans that is are end ideal
more can we the him not expect
if the than see that this people total not alternative have us only but in misery would to and our industry there many worse would do stand than the the at than the there to them many to many listened
i believe that the also the the council is to to try not only from the national important but also from the joint european important to act because united we the  we fallback and that last should we certainly not forget
mr the president best mr programmes a the the fundamental demands the the european parliament and the the commission reads that the european union more competence must to the the area the the trade and the external economic policy president prodi you has this just still stressed
when we now see that the french presidency mr the presidentinoffice president the the council the this level a decisive role plays than must we the that we today few days for the beginning the the igc still the zero are
you bears the responsibility for the success the this company you mr the presidentinoffice president the the council you the necessary manoeuvre
not only on the movement the goods but also on the movement the services investment the intellectual property and the competition would the qualified majority in the council the ministers must be decided and article member must accordingly be amended
that is our main demand
we that like say the european union are good for the the trade and the services in the world the united states for not more than
therefore to we the responsibility for a further opening the the world for the introduction the our technological and  in many countries all the world
the large majority the the representatives the the governments favour for the strengthening the the role the the european union this i i in our commission constitutional affairs personally can the
the is obviously the french government the here causing
we should not forget that france there if large economic nation immediately the benefits if the european union with a voice can speak the the other large  programmes in the world as the united states canada and the asian countries
the is according us rightly that france are interests the the area the the own cultural identity the with the cultural identity the very europe out is people defends
we favour for a compromise that unanimity provides for the cases which the this interests the has i believe that this a way can are to from the impasse to out
mr the president for the beginning the not few intergovernmental conference were the signs positive
there were especially open questions and there was but little agreement
now few days for the beginning the this intergovernmental conference are the signs again may
but paradoxical enough is the this time especially the the hardest consensus the many the us political decapitation delivers
the agreement the the day to day higher the is although not the smallest lowest lowest but unfortunately earlier a extremely small lowest lowest
many under us fear therefore that the institutional reforms the nice the union not really push for the large enlargement with or more new member least not without new further reforms
the seems i doubtful that the in the new greater family easier will are to to agreement to to than now
but we can always continue hope
apart the the general balance the the next igc is there still a small but not directly project detail that i ensure concern
in the resolution on nice where we here on debate the in paragraph a last  this is that the that the parliament in the procedure the article treaty threat the the democracy rights the the human etc also the initiative must to
general about would this the central role the the commission undermine because its exclusive initiative is for the union the essential important
a initiative for the european parliament would also the this extremely sensitive area the door leaves open for party arbitrary
want the european social the this proposal have tabled now any election which a left majority lost is opportunity to a european  to the
i like this warn and question you to tomorrow against this  to vote
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the french presidency the the union has with the active commitment the jacques chirac the attention the europe located the a series issue programmes the the large important are for our future
therefore have the protagonists the the summit the nice a difficult task to role a task the high level and therefore in agreement with the ambitious projects
president prodi for you will the not easy are just as less if for the state and government together with them must you a solution see to find for a large number problems the the inevitable enlargement to the reform the the institutions and the amendment the mechanisms the by the events are outpaced to the  the the charter the the fundamental a first step the way to a european constitution
what the freedom rights the the human and scientific research have the people and are representatives in this parliament and in the national parliaments the last floor
therefore mr the president do we a appeal the this sitting to to ensure that brussels and strasbourg not  be for national 
we are here to the europe the the future the to build in that europe must outdated mechanisms carefully be reformed to a social market to create the employment and development creates
that everything manage not without the involvement and the myself support the the peoples they must europe see if a guarantee for their rights and their future not if the rich the the bureaucracy and the move  the the 
let we there joint for ensure that nice not point the but the copout the a project project
short we must all to to the maximum achievable this is the need that we there also fully in believe
mr the president we the forza italia and the the ppe believe the we will together with you work the the construction the the europe the the citizens
mr the president i would in the first place the members want thank for this stable debate
there the a european council for the door the really the very large important is and very many efforts will require and in this type situations is always a certain tension felt the the precise read even in certain articles in the press to there is
that will perceived europeans moreover not surprised
to my opinion is this a excellent debate been a very useful discussion which you many important issues the the item has the
i am fact especially has to to your comments to listen
i will try with what here said is so possible account to the and i will the this debate certainly report produce the the french president the the european council the nice will chairing as the the french prime and the my mr programmes in the council general affairs the next monday
in this respect is the debate therefore very useful been
however how sense this exercise also must are because the many relevant questions the are raised and the many suggestions the are done i would however want say that i the during on the whole taken to negative think
i believe that the spirit the everything what here to raised is the how strong the many positions also the other differences the european reality the this at not good represents
the reality is namely that we progress yes even long progress make
i note than also a certain discrepancy between the here expressed ensure which i course good authority and the i course respect and the the not undoubted progress in the practice
as would i example the agreement on harmonisation can mention that very recently the basis the unanimity even to the is has
there was already years awaited to that agreement to i believe is there already in for the first on about
as a the your mr programmes has said with a reference to the optimism the the americans and the way which the on itself speak we must what which work the and which progress made the the to gentlemen know to importance
what the approach the must i say that i really not would know how a country that responsible is with the presidency the otherwise would must do
the the presidency can we not additional powers sense and the task the us not the right the place the others in to take
we to only a number responsibilities the the shoulders the and the try we as good possible the us to take
i would for this issues the institutional nature the now once extremely complicated are not other approach know than the problems a for a the to tackle to listen to the positions the all parties to try manoeuvre to create all to questions in what respect only flexibility to expect is and then proposals to formulate which with this everything account taken is
the presidency can therefore the the necessary do but when the establish that the is deadlock the everything what the does and like is the the forced the positions the the member in eligible to take to to avoid that the undemocratic to work is
take example the charter
you know that the french presidency the regard the this subject properly dynamic is been
well we have must the that different member the charter if such would reject if the a legal basis would to
some member were there even the against that certain social issues or certain new rights in the text mentioned would be
to further to to had we therefore a compromise see to achieve which we us belonging that there in the history the europe certainly examples are the to point the texts without legal basis the however a considerable influence have had the the crucial the mentality and the political developments
that is exactly why the is the a constructive compromise
when there last a agreement was achieved on the text a good text moreover the very sound is prepared by the convention good to read is and really consultation has was by few countries the idea funds the text to into in article
and what has the presidency then done that itself if a the the member favour was the that idea
the has this proposal raised during the discussions but several countries have said no if you to the article draw we even our assent with the charter if such in
the is therefore in the whole not the intention the to see the the proclaim the the charter and there is also not there the a lack the transparency
everything what there happening is completely transparent nothing the being and on everything the length discussed
you you really the everything fully the the informed
the point is that certain countries only with the charter agreed have the condition that the text a purely political text would continue
what can the presidency this do
we can the countries the the this point a non sine terms non make not the the discussion out we must us to the the the rules the the democracy
you has the still but on democracy but the there not only the you they there also in the council general affairs in the european council in all meetings and in all debates
that must we good for view the
with a lack the ambition has that nothing to make contrary precisely because we as ambitious are been in this issue and the tackle the the institutional reform can the however certainly ambitious mention have we so resistance met
without expressed ambitions would there the strong resistance not there are been
the affairs depend closely with other together
we do us best to the as but to say
i believe than also that us not other way open than simply further to to clarity to provide and the the european council a clear fair speech to give the the positions the all parties the regard the each subject already will we course first try in the positions so possible movement to to
further would i still want say that there the a problem between large and small countries i i not there is
the term small countries use i here just for the ease normal about isolationism i the would
i am namely the opinion am that not only country that part part the the european union the what extent also a small country is because any member can influence exercise in all important issues
this traditional distinction is today the day not really relevant more and everyone know how the press with this distinction just
what the intergovernmental conference the is there only the one subject reference made the a disagreement between the large and the small countries namely the extent the the commission
and even the this one point is that not rightly because the the proposals the are done was the not to proposals the the large countries to the small countries to disadvantage
the was to a call the everyone to sacrifices to to small mediumsized and large countries together
the basis the the call has the idea  that there there was the a unlike between the large and the small countries
that idea is the nothing based the is completely wrong both the regard the the three other  the the igc if the regard the the other issue programmes the the european council the nice
again the is a wrong possible the affairs and the seems i the best the issue further but to ignore
what the comments on the qualified majority the on would i want say that you mr poettering the there what easy the the has made if you i this words allow you the one country in the was and does if a less rigid attitude the that country enough to all other countries to let 
but  is exactly what we done have in the issue the the extent the the commission
when we  that the commission in the future not already to has would must are to to guarantee that they effective would can continue operate and would can continue have on already its powers with particularly on its right the initiative have we also we us prepared shown this a sacrifice to to
the upholds  has because also consequences for the large countries also the will the a the at not in the commission represented are exactly as the other countries
the discrimination is therefore not there
our accommodating attitude has however not follow been and has the the other countries not led to that if 
that applies also for the enlargement the the qualified majority
the this at are twelve the the fifteen countries the opinion that there issues are which far not decisions the qualified majority taken can be
the twelve accept the principle the qualified majority as the enlargement that in the future but they to the the the position that they certain legitimate democratic interests to defend have and that what that the still not the all conditions is met
that is the situation which i to make i in my capacity the presidentinoffice president the the council
the positions the the different parties the also not the with other with the solution the a internal problem the the one country is a internal problem the the other country still not situation
what also our ambitions are we can not otherwise than the that this difficulties the arise the presidency has this issue repeatedly in different meetings raised and will that also during the meeting the next sunday again do
i am here however has to you a description the the current situation to give and the description is now once not fully line with your expectations
i give the the the affairs however again as the is
we have hard work but we with still again the same problem i i can the impasse not broken be by a  attitude the one only country as said we have now once to make with the hard reality in twelve the the fifteen member in national political and democratic respect
course must we try further to to because very satisfactory is the situation now not
we will the here than also not the let and in the short period to nice will we again try more manoeuvre to create
but this everything wanted i you however like clear make
i will not to long constraints
this particularly interesting debate has already long took and there the us still a another not less interesting debate to wait
i would only still a appeal the your  want do
the is i i not rightly that you the presidentinoffice presidency the advance still before the european council has place to scapegoat makes and your disappointment opinion on something what still to must
the is still to early to conclusions to draw i aware that you already long waiting that you impatient the that you hope laws and ambitious you
i i this all understanding for i i there open for and i matters there account that
i will try ensure to ensure that we the feelings in us mind the the the take the the political decisions the us to wait are the the at that there in nice connection long must be
in nice is the not to the success or the failure the the french presidency
we have not texts adopted and in the treaties the no that the presidentinoffice presidency all other parties the other member the commission the parliament their infinitum and responsibilities would can deprive
in nice will the fifteen joint their responsibility must take the fifteen the decided have negotiations to open with twelve countries the a step forward want to and the expect to a in all respects more and more europe
the fifteen will joint a answer must find the the question to more clarity transparency and democracy
i am that convinced that they a solution will find for all problems the here by you the there are the and which you the attention the the presidency has asked
i like you this again thank together will we the solutions find
i think that the parliament after nice will can the that the european union the enriched has with a number improved institutional mechanisms with through which we giving can give the the further development the the union a development the us all regard
mr the president i thank you for the leadership the the debate the mr védrine for are speech and the members for the high level the the debate
i like now only still few points on the next days further explain and stress that the commission determined is to ensure for a summit the high level so our institutions last a structure to which they also after the large enlargement can continue function
the enlargement i say the still agree is a the the few large political decisions the the world in the near future can expect
i like there also the point that the commission the not only will make for the this mentioned elements but also for a careful and study treatment the the charter the the fundamental
i know very good that the not immediately constitution will be but i know also that the from nice constantly if reference will must for the principles the the european institutions and the the future cooperation the the european peoples
therefore is the as important that in nice the community method the gentlemen the the european institutions the council the parliament and the commission and their mutual cooperation be strengthened
we have here today perhaps forget that we part of the same process that we not only are but part are the the future europe
the finally president védrine you has said that the situation here perhaps what to odds is and that we quite pessimistic are
i like my call the the your to
i know very good that in nice fifteen countries will decide and not only the presidency but i know from experience what the role and the responsibilities the the french presidency are
in the last years have we a large number important decisions to the period the the french presidency postponed because we confidence had in france and are responsibility and because the always a important role has played in the development the the european institutions
you has rightly said that france not all responsibility for the summit can to but the must us with are leadership and initiative the good example give
two points and i take the responsibility this clear and with emphasis to point are evening emphatically if important issues to the has
on the votes the the vote has france the responsibility with a proposal to to that a fundamental balance between large and small countries creates a balance between the population and the  the the countries
france must the telecommunications find for the achieve the the europe the the peoples and the nations that is what we the france expect
but we expect also a another gesture we know very good that france not if only responsible is for the impasse which the member the are the is to france spain germany the belgium and italy after have all countries areas which they the veto not like want madam
according i is the role the the presidency also here the fundamental important because i know that not only country the can the the the status quo if france the fails exactly the to to what the general important is the the decisions on article
we all count the this step forward because the is not only a step forward for france but for very europe
applause
mr the minister we count this because we a large confidence have in your country and in are ability to the the difficult moments the europe the leadership to take
applause
thank you the mr the president the the commission
to decision the this statements i i nine motions the eight groups accordance article member the the rules received
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow place
as informed by the president mrs fontaine the the beginning the the sitting to we now on to the treatment the the points the item
i like your attention questions for the relief should the morning in the commission foreign affairs the this parliament place when the turkish minister the foreign affairs with us 
a number members the a  group tried the sitting to upset and endangered the president
this was a insult the the work the this parliament and a both snub the a very much guest this event had particularly serious consequences can have
mr the president i request you the quaestors task give the guilty the to encourage after to to how they the access have can provide to the parliament and ensure to ensure that their in the future the access the refused
you you also appropriate steps take to the safety in the general such the to more that a such event the not can repeat
the is sometimes difficult to legitimate visitors and groups this building within to to for visitors with simpleand intentions seems the a document easier to are
we started this sitting with the express the us sympathy for the recent victims the the terrorism in spain
there are  that those the responsible are for the demonstration in the commission foreign affairs links have with a turkish terrorist group
i know certainly that everyone in this parliament the with i agree will are if i any form the terrorism condemn what the motivation this also may are
with the to turkey to we many demands the the turkish government and the turkish people now they the first steps to the the long way to accession to the european union
same expect we that  in turkey the only will those the peaceful resources
i will a statement with this thrust the the parliament present and am that that all colleagues here this statement will support
mr the president i request you kind on the by i mentioned points report from to to the this parliament
mr the president i like i with the the statement the my mr the mr the orden
yesterday are two people forces in a sitting the the commission foreign affairs and have this balance they have our guest the turkish minister the foreign affairs support and physical threatened
the was a dangerous situation
i believe to know that the both taken the parliament are received thanks a mr the the parliament
i will our president its name pass and its ask this matter to into and appropriate measures to take to to prevent that taken and  in us parliament illuminated and than still the with the aid the a member the this parliament
i think the a too scandal when a member such methods used
i like the bureau the a second point point
if this situation expressions will we in the future problems have with the safety the our guests
i am the opinion that we many more measures must take to ensure to ensure that the guests the this parliament the welcome can feel and not afraid need to are that they threatened will be
this must we the necessary organisational and  measures take that means that our guests by this trained people must be protected because we can not appeal do the foreign  to our guests to protect
i am the opinion that we to make have with a new challenge and i like the bureau ask this the i to take
mr the president behalf my group like i the president fully support
we want the  not restrict contrary and we want also not a additional equipped section create the is here to minimum safety
foreign guests will not more to our committees want to if a minimum protection not is guaranteed
in our commission was both the president the a country if the turkish minister the foreign affairs present when this incident place
i like you the the heart express this very serious the to summarise so we also in the future guests can received and them if guests can deal
mr the president i was not the the informed the that incident
i am there completely the against that who than also a minister threatens the here to guest is or the now turkish is or not
but now we the however on turkey have would i the the next want point a member the my group mrs uca has to yesterday my group represented during a congress the a kurdish party in turkey the hadep
now has they this per accident a briefly  in the kurdish expressed before on to to the its mother the german
immediately is its by the police the silent imposed its was not only the speak in the kurdish impossible made and that was they already not agree more but even in the german
hardly a day later is the mr  a important man in the  parliament he is here in us own parliament moreover already agree to guest been a visa for turkey refused that he note less had requested to in cyprus a  between turks greeks and displaced to can attend the was here therefore a completely men mission
i i than also for mr the president that you mrs the president request the turkish authorities a write to do sent which they one its me offering for the free act towards a the the representatives the the turkish authorities but hand clear to know the that the the this way not with european members can deal or with members the countries the a visit want to the turkey
welcoming are we here like but than expect we also hospitality and respect there
i approve i behalf my group fully behind this complaint on this particularly serious and even frustration incident
i would the mr wurtz want say we turkey if preparation the are integration with europe the immunity and the force the the parliamentary democracy let see
if we this aspects here in this parliament as important find must we our guests however certainly can welcome and protect the a very what credible way than the what we yesterday in the proving
if ourselves not proud are the us parliament can we the the turks not expect that they us example will follow
mr the president i wanted your attention and the the the mr programmes draw the the by the mr wurtz mentioned fact the turkish government has refused the cyprus politician   leader the the  access to to to turkey
he wanted in  participate the a meeting the turkish greek and cyprus parties i must the also been that   vicepresident is the the cyprus delegation in the joint parliamentary commission eucyprus
i like behalf the communist party the greece this new provocation the turkey the note less a candidate for accession to the eu the the denounce to and you ask behalf the european parliament my protest the to signs
i can you inform that mrs fontaine that is i as passed and i join i the the behalf the bureau this serious incident deeply regrets
the clearly themselves that we here in this house the the european democracy the safety the already our guests and all the under us side state must to guarantee
course must also the freedom the expression to be respected
now is report asked by our president mrs fontaine the the secretarygeneral
that report will course as soon possible be reports
the president will to the the that report not fail the necessary measures to take and also the the bodies the this parliament in to decided the the involved must be as example the quaestors or the bureau
mr the president recently is in  the capital the the region  a the the most italian region programmes  democrats attacked and beaten he is the president the the regional government the  and was to june the this year member the the european parliament
that shows how support violence can lead to physical violence
this parliament must not only are solidarity express with a leading figure a important italian politician and former mr but such events also strong condemn and the solidarity show
i thank you for your contribution mr tajani
we will of the appropriate way note take
mr the president i like only but say that there today a delegation the workers the radio italia in the parliament present is
radio italia is a count company in the telecommunications
this workers are to the parliament has to a petition the to offer the by more than people is signed and to the european institutions to support to questions
why because they by their company are redundancies although that economic healthy is and already years growing
radio italia is therefore a company that the tariffs increase and the number jobs reduce
in this weeks this days discuss we on the charter the the fundamental and also on the social fundamental the workers
the would therefore sense are if this parliament a contrast between score danger the the one on and the cruelty reality the the other on tried to avoid
we ask therefore the parliament and the commission the more in to to for the redundancies workers and for the fight the the unemployment
mr the president yesterday is in italy something extremely  happened
the minister the health has the dignity the the individual undermined by to the liberalisation the drugs to questions with if motivation that  not evil can and under the motto let we cancer with  cure
that everything happening while we us the the prepare are the nice with a charter the the fundamental that in the preamble confirms that the basis the the union located is the the affirming and universal values the human dignity
that happening while a community action for the fight the drug the force is that intended is to drug to prevent and therefore the that escapism must be avoid and according i not encouraged
also  undcp  the the united nations and director the the bureau the the un for  and crime has the statements the the italian minister the health condemned the minister the there demonstrated the the positive  from the united states spain and even  and peru not to know
speaker the by the president cut
the the beginning the the sitting the today has mrs the president honour expressed the the memory the any 
any  was in together with are brother and myself and more than sixty other lecturers by the franco the the university the barcelona from
from the time i i despite our different political views still can see that the involvement the any  the the fight for dialogue and mutual understanding completely sincerely was even when he was faced with the authoritarian positions the the current government
the best honour the we any  and are memory can proof would are if we are message are  in the catalan  perhaps can we this message in basque a opportunity give
thank you the mr gorostiaga
i request you to to are and the plates way to to
mr the president i like like the attention questions the the presidency for a letter the we sent have in the with the statute the the members
mrs hautala has in the letter reference made the our support and our sympathy for the efforts the the president mrs fontaine to to to to negotiations on us own statute if member
we regret the than also the very that a sitting the planned was for november is cancelled
we insist there the very the the that still for the end the the french presidency a additional sitting would be meet established such that the discussion on the statute made can be completed
thank you the mrs maes
i will this pass the mrs fontaine the the on of measures will take
mr the president last year has the council a excellent initiative taken namely the institution the the first forum the the european union on the human
this tremendous initiative the this year reiterated with a second forum that the and december in paris will place that like say during the partsession the the european parliament in strasbourg
that is the are least said illadvised towards us parliament to not to say downright insulting or the must are that the the opinion is that the european members not input have when the to the human is already have they recently still with very large majority the charter the the fundamental adopted the this forum the the european union will they in any case lack and that while they last year in big numbers present were to the mind to exchange with the ngos programmes and the involved institutions
i am here than also the wish from that there the way the protest not official representation the the parliament to this forum sent will be and i would like see that for this important meeting next year a date elected the the not interests with a partsession in strasbourg so the members in the will are the forum the to live
you you right mr 
that must in the future as possible otherwise
mr the president when the mr gorostiaga the floor dialogue used to to suggest that the tributes any  the with him agree would are offence he the his memory and the ideas the for the eta reason were him to murder
mr gorostiaga i despises the terrorists the the eta our but people the this parliament the  way use to their murders to justify despises i also
mr gorostiaga you you a image for this parliament
colleagues we to here on not only subject debate
course can the the other on everyone are opinion say
mr the president i like not polemical but now we today a minute silence in eight have taken for the victims the a new without the the eta must i however say that there someone in this parliament is the says a dialogue to want into with same those the the mr  have killed
the seems i indeed  as mrs díez has said the memory the any  the this way to use
i think that this parliament now very good know what the the the mr gorostiaga the group the he represents and their terrorist friends to expect has
however question i the mr gorostiaga or him still a ounce personally decency rest or he still just sufficient human dignity possession to sensitive to are for our demand the human life to respect
i like respond the the loathsome action the the two colleagues in this parliament the ideas to the rightfully the favour like against the the any 
he has always struggle for dialogue he wanted nothing would than dialogue
i like only say that any action the the eta the the to
mr gorostiaga i  you the floor
we have now enough this talk
common foreign and security afghanistan
mr the president mr the president the the council mr the president the the council the ministers the defence as i you like would corner mr the commissioner i think that the balance the the development the the foreign security and defence the the last year already with already very positive is
we have us always extremely critical the the commission and the council up but now like i you to to start congratulate the way which cologne and helsinki with the decisions the previous week gradually were into is the result the excellent work which i all involved like congratulate
after our disastrous experience in the former yugoslavia have we recognised that prevention and civil crisis little persuasion have if the not same clear can make that the this objectives also with military resources can enforceable by this knowledge have the governments the the fifteen member the council and the commission considerable progress can make
i hope that the implementation the this decisions not a as tiger remains but that now also the necessary transposition through the national budgets can be achieved
we have nothing the thousand soldiers if this same paralysed and blind are
as the european union and the member not have on sufficient  are they paralysed
they are blind as we not have on the necessary  as boat to this any sense and sensible to can working when the circumstances that require
on the priorities are we the agree the commitment the military is our burden 
our main task is there by a sensible policy and sensible civil crisis for to ensure that the commitment the military resources can be prevent
this must we i i a close cooperation between the institutions the the european union and the member the the to
the civil crisis and the prevention and all instruments the the to look the today the day especially under the responsibility the the community
the budget the the european union form four time so resources from for  aid if the budget the the united states
the trade is largely under the competence the the commission
like the notable between the civil and the military function than must we ensure ensure that this levels not be separate by a institutional  but that they be brought
as the commission was the european parliament already for amsterdam the opinion that our prefer would take to a for the foreign policy responsible vicepresident the the commission the same the role the high representative would modified with a special obligation towards and bond with the council
this was political whose and therefore have we now two people the any the are way excellent work make
the are not this people the the friction cause but this is a result the the institutional structure we must there everything the do to this problems to to
moreover brings this view us back the the european parliament
the european parliament wishes full involvement the this policy as the in the treaties is for as the perhaps in nice the improve and as the is for in the interinstitutional agreement between the council the commission and the parliament on the powers the the european parliament on the budget the the foreign and security
this the in that the competence for the budget the the civil management apart the the the council also the the european parliament based the national parliaments retain the breaking for the defence because our armies forms today the day still not european force but convenants under the competence the the national governments and the national parliaments
also the their on the troops is under the national responsibility because each country sovereign decision or the the a action part or not
we must ensure ensure that the labour clear is and that we a platform for consultation between the european parliament and the national parliaments create so we if members by the information the different levels in the are to the executive power the sensible way to control
the executive power the the decisions the the area the the foreign security and defence
we decisions on the resources and control or this good that the handled and or there a sensible policy the held
i think that this a good concept will
there take already consultation place between the european parliament and the national parliaments to the developments in good jobs to lead
what the organisation the am i the opinion that the european parliament that the such enormous efforts made also this the responsibility must to
i i the that the affairs in example kosovo not to properly function and that we soon a coordinator for the coordinators need have because there as many institutions the involved are not the european but many other and that must we in the hand to
in my report i i this only if aspect included the report the our mr lalumière is many more the this point in
we are us aware the the fact that there in many parts the the world to the awaited that the european union in the is to the role the mediator to role so the responsibility can be divided think you but the the east or historic where a serious threat there in the with the 
there upon therefore a large responsibility the our shoulders for the enforcement the the peace the us in europe and in the world
i hope that this instruments us in the will to our duty gradually to role
in this the mr the president the the council am i the opinion that we with particularly in afghanistan a contribution must make there must a end to the the murders that already decades long place and that now by a  regime against the own population the continue
the people in afghanistan must in a proper peaceful and social fair world can life we must try this the to to
mr the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the council mr the minister the defence mr the commissioner we deal afternoon the european security and defence and as president brok just has said to we the the a area that us optimistic vote the regard the the european europe
we can to us pleased the that since the running european councils the cologne helsinki and feira progress are made the this new policy and hope can we the the series soon also the european council the nice add
a such progress is not as often for and we are there than also very welcome that mr the minister the defence
as the european parliament the june the the eve the the summit the feira a resolution has adopted as would the parliament tomorrow the the eve the the european council the nice also again a text must adopt which are position is reflect
course hope i that a clear majority for the tabled resolution will vote but now already know i that this text divided received will be
that is also normal because the is here to a difficult area which different political choices to expression to the to make have with the roles between the union and the member the relationship between the military dimension and the civil dimension the position the the union the relation the the nato and the united states and the role the the union in the world further must the union a choice to make between peacekeeping and nonintervention one and the to to crisis hand
the choices lead sometimes to divided but gradually start the however a majority the to signs
accept unforeseen circumstances would the majority the line must support the since half year followed the by the council the ministers the high representative for the common foreign and security the mr solana and the commission and than with particularly commissioner patten the from under the are function responsible is for the civil resources the for the crisis despite this support the to i hope in clear and thoughtthrough very expressed will be to we the many the issues large question and in some cases believe we even a warning to must give
in the first place would i a comment want make on the very fundamental problem the the relationship between this new european policy and the nato
this have we length about in the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence
in the text the now before the the positions the the european council confirmed the is not the intention to compete with the nato and nor is the the intention the nato the responsibility on the defence the us territory to deprive
the is is the europe a credible partner the the united states to make by a new balance to the to to within the atlantic alliance and by the european union a certain extent the autonomy to to in case the crisis
in the second place is in the resolution the very strong like the the parliament to the to the security and defence the two equal pillars to base the civil management and the military management
with the view the this balance see the parliament carefully to the a fair distribution the the financial resources already aware we that the civil pillar from the community budget financed the and that the military pillar far the funded is the the national budgets
in the third place does the us welcome that the common european security and defence specific giving the through the introduction the the rapid force
also are we pleased on the many work that already done is with particularly during the recent conference on the staggered the capabilities
this results make this policy credible
they offer us also the opportunity the balance the to make the the the which our forces situation and support to offer the the to to reform as i recently in berlin with the to the him i can the
what the by you introduced institutional reforms the would i that want point that we want that the union less the with a coherent clear and effective 
we can not enough with the create the bodies if the  the military committee and the military staff we must there also for ensure that the horizontal and vertical  between already this bodies flexible and quickly function
the this point are we not whole and already reassured and we would than also like see that the powers in times the crisis the the commission the council and the high representative for the common foreign and security more defined be
mr the president i would in the briefly still a large problem with the to the credibility the this policy the the item want to namely the issue the the budget
there can although savings achieved be but we can not out that there new resources need will are to the the gaps the to complement especially the the area the advanced technologies
mr the president just as president brok was i like the the role the the european parliament and the parliamentary institutions entered on is still the necessary to say
the representatives the the council would i want say that the european parliament that also is last the culture the safety and defence to acquire the we as  have we hope that the summit the nice a programme success will be
the the discussion in the commission constitutional affairs on the comprehensive and interesting report the mrs lalumière on the common european security and defence have we us especially concentrated the the institutions and the decisionmaking and in the particularly the the need the parliamentary control and democratic aware and responsibility
the development the the  means a important new step in the development the the european project therefore must the existing institutional framework clarification be
the question or there legal arguments are to to say that the existing powers sufficient are is here not the the item
the is clear that the parliamentary dimension involved must be involved
not only member the a national parliament would also but a at consider a limited and but transparent democratic research to safety and defence to accept
within the borders the the operational safety are in the united states even the senate and the house the members closely involved he the activities the the prosecutor the defence
because the special nature the the possible developments the the  believe we also that there changes in the treaty need will are so this open and democratic can place also must clarification be what the status the the high representative is in relationship to the current institutional triangle and to the commissioner responsible with external relations
mr the president you know probably that my party in the united kingdom large any has against the general thrust the this policy
i like however like this opportunity to benefit take to my colleagues in the commission constitutional affairs to thank for their opinions this have to contributed that i now with a position come that to i hope for this very much parliament acceptable is
mr the president given the delay the we have behind and given my obligations elsewhere will i try the story that i had prepared somewhat in to cut
the was a extended speech but i will try not important affairs to forget
gentlemen members to the the the presentation the the reports the mrs lalumière and the mr brok can i you now a first overview give the the important developments the the last months the this areas
i will to to start the balance made the the most institutional developments the the area the the foreign and security with particularly the regard the the european defence the mr willing richard my mr the defence will later like the all issues the associated with the military capabilities
further will i the most results the the common foreign and security the the last months explain
the finally will i answer give or try to give the the oral question the the mr brok with the to afghanistan
in the first place therefore the strengthening the the common foreign and security
as the mr brok just has indicated has europe the this area the last year emphatically the the do speak this is the that there developments way are the for the future the large important are
that applies in the first place for the european defence the the last years still more giving been has
in follow the the german finnish and portuguese presidency has the french presidency the effort to the in feira granted mandate from to to
the this point will nice i i a milestone forms a important at which we a number affairs can finish that applies especially for the institution the the permanent bodies the the european defence which the european union in the the the in the during the the year the a crisis the head to offer
as said will the issue the the capabilities will discussed be by the mr richard
also the institutional aspects the this policy are the large important because the issue in what the union in the is forward to look decisions to take and to action on to to that like say political control from to exercise and strategic leadership to give the a scars
in nice will the european council in this the several decisions must approve the i you now will mention
in the first place is the to the institution the the permanent political and military bodies the committee for political and security the military committee and the military staff the the european union
the for the this administrative apparatus will  down be and will a  sensitive be the the secretariat the the council
as agreed in feira will this new bodies as quickly possible after the summit the nice set be
in the second place like i like the the permanent regulations with third countries and with the nato
you know how important this regulations are there must a good the confidence based opposition to the the to be with the nato both with the from the not to the union properly if with candidates for accession to the union under strict respect the the autonomous decisionmaking the the european union
the relationship will in the particularly giving must to through meetings between the north council and the arrangements for political and security and through meetings between the european union and the fifteen european nato the not member or still not member the the union are
also have we work the the strengthening the the civil capabilities the for the management especially in the framework the the objective the the european union the the has on the up the a european police
in answer the the comments in the report on the need still agree good after to think on prevention would i that want point that the high representative for the common foreign and security and the commission a number recommendations have prepared to the cohesion and the effectiveness the the actions the that area to increase i know that the swedish presidency this line will continue
the report the the mr brok contains also a number questions and comments on the increase the the effectiveness the the foreign policy the the european union
this issue is a the the issues which i i also really personally i been
there had progress in the matter to was i because the was the clear that the situation little satisfactory was
that is also the reason why i this issue the the agenda i the during the informal meeting the the ministers the foreign affairs in evian beginning september we have there when a whole sitting the devoted which we are based the the proposals and the plans the commissioner patten
since are there long progress made
the council general affairs has the october a number conclusions adopted the are at the improvement the the coordination and the management and the the introduction the a number instruments the for the decisionmaking need are
the council has decided annual a debate on this issues to organise
the first debate will place during the sitting the january or february and will us the opportunity offer the balance the to make the the first stage the implementation the this new measures
i like there with emphasis the point that to this everything decided is in close cooperation and in good consultation with the council the ministers the high representative for the common foreign and security and the commission more in the particularly commissioner patten
with the recommendations in the brok will the council the available to on a overview the the relations between the union and all partner order more benefit to draw the the whole the the efforts the the union the effectiveness that to increase and the debates on the foreign policy better for to prepare
with the view the the first debate beginning next year will the commission per country a overview up the the last year which the balance drawn will be the the commitments obligations the payments and the payment the the most programme programmes the be financed from the community budget and from the european development
the this work the we emphatically account with the fact that the necessary is the programmes programmes the for the third countries the the commission and the the the member better the other the to vote course with respect the the specific powers the the commission
this applies both for the programme programmes the the traditional about the the member if for the programme programmes the specialised offices
than would i now few comments want make on the the the treaty the amsterdam introduced new instruments and on the interinstitutional relations two issues which you the in your reports somewhat concerned shows
since may are there three common strategies adopted with the to russia ukraine and the mediterranean
the presidency has the secretarygeneral and the high representative for the common foreign and security now asked a first report for to prepare on the implementation the the common strategies and on the optimum the that
this report would presented must be during the debate beginning next year which i just about i
what the interinstitutional relations the can i say that the discussion which the mr brok just mentioned has i know is
the is here to the question or the tasks the the high representative for the common foreign and security not granted had must be the a the the vicepresident the the commission
as you however itself already the mr brok is the mr solana since are office with the fully respect for the in the treaty established rules and procedures to work has whole in line with the intentions the the respective presidencies
there is a good cooperation the the on has and there has the not only present problem occurred short the is simply good
the the tackle the different large problems which we the last period faced are been is a close and constructive cooperation between all bodies possible has
take example the developments in the balkans all institutions have here what done what the they expect was
we see in the southeast the europe now a strong policy the the on to that also are results start the to throw
now would i a short and course provisional first balance want made the the measures the by the french presidency taken are to europe the full are role the the international stage to let play
i will this in the briefly few region programmes and few events the encompasses let through
first like i a few comments make on the balkans which i just already about i
the situation in the region is completely changed by the power in belgrade already remains there course still the necessary to do
we had a clear line for europe down the was the intention the the suitable at that like say before the elections the serbian people a in evian drawn message on to to the endorsed that the policy the europe carefully review would be if the democracy would mechanistic
the democracy has indeed prevailed after many utterly the all know are
we have us floor than also fulfilling done and the  the the current yugoslavia assure us that the message the europe time certainly a role has played in the affair
we continue this logical line than also follow
as have we a beginning made with the restore the the relations with yugoslavia the all areas
that like not say that we the opinion are that all problems resolved are
everyone know that there the regard the kosovo and montenegro still very what must done and that applies also for the relations the yugoslavia with the neighbouring and for the obligations the the country towards the war
the european union has however felt that the the the the important is everything to do to the democratic movement to support to the at which the already its objectives achieved will have and the democracy final restore will are than can yugoslavia a beginning make with a thorough revision the are policy with particularly the regard the the neighbouring
against the background is the recently in zagreb taken summit the large importance been
this summit was in a other context prepared and had the intention on the head the the leaders the that at across a political message on to to the the serbian people
thanks the recent developments have we the this summit the zagreb the first real democratic meeting can make the the plenary european union with all representatives the the western balkans
we have us also been with the issue the the regional cooperation a concept that a certain resistance  the few countries in this region the not again bogged want are in a past which they last have know to escape we can i i the to that they thanks this summit have recognised that this regional cooperation their rapprochement to the european union not in the way the a rapprochement the with particularly process through the process the stabilisation and cooperation that the this opportunity confirmed and further developed is
this summit a initiative the the french presidency has also a confirmation possible made the our commitment for this region briefly this had we because still the necessary decisions taken on the important programme programmes for the mediterranean and the balkans
for the new  in the french  known is a amount the billion euro allocated for the period
there is therefore still very many to do with the view the a sustainable restoration the the democracy and the regional cooperation but there is in any case there the a framework and a strategy and i i the the european union the this area a clear direction for view
same has the european union in the deliberate period the relations with its large strategic partners counterparts with particularly with russia
the october has in the framework the the partnership and cooperation the summit eurussia place
us policy is clear we want the basis the the principles the democracy and respect for the human the rule and the free market the huge revolution the russia place as good possible support and encourage so the end after a process that the necessary time will costs a project country will close that constantly in development is the all fronts  and objective to peace short the type country that we like if neighbour would want have
we must ensure ensure that all instruments the for the cooperation with russia both the community if the national instruments in the direction recognition be
there has also a summit place between the european union and ukraine the september and the fruitful political dialogue with this country credit the now from to issues if exports the conventional arms safety and disarmament
what this last subject the has the osce indicated that there the problems arise with ukraine and the seems than also desirable this issue the this dialogue to involve
in response the the by the mr brok expressed concern the regard the more forms the cooperation with ukraine example in the framework the the common foreign and security would i want say that this issue the the item the will be in a in nice to present report the will the agreements with our partners explained be the basis which the a contribution can make the by the european union led military heat
moreover does ukraine what this the already particularly good are best since july has the country the behind statements supported which the presidency behalf the european union to outside is into
further have we also the transatlantic dialogue on the balkans continue all the this region specific policies the the european union are constantly subject the discussion been between europe and the united states
that applies also for the policy the regard the russia and the peace in the east already has my comment not much the the the last months but especially the the period the limitations the the tragic events the the since end september in the region have occurred
also have we in this months the united states very good the the informed taken the the current developments the the area the the european security and defence that is a essential condition for a harmonious development the that policy a development the now also visible is
what this presidency the is the dialogue still not the end because there is the december next a summit planned in washington and a day later a in ottawa
there are problems same the the euromediterranean conference the marseilles because the for many the our arab partners difficult was in the current circumstances the this meeting part to take
however have we centre and end have all partners the two exceptions after the meeting attended
i i that from the way the the work and the fierce debates the on this extremely sensitive issue are held that we there good the have done the meeting to let continue
the was us course also to continuation the the as important process the barcelona that the this at under great is because the situation in the east but that a very important project for the future remains a strategic concept for the long term that not the discussion the must be the on the the tragic events the this at how even the also are
the meeting has despite everything therefore however place and we have there the financial framework for meda ii for the period announced namely billion euro
this must the by the eib appropriations loans still  must be which the total the almost billion euro is
from that the that the commitment the the european union the relation the this region the substantial mentioned must be
what the east the of can i say that the presidency constantly contact the with all involved parties even the the most critical moments
we have done been that the mr solana could participate the the summit the sharm  the october and that was a historic fact
we have behalf the fifteen a statement on this issue made in marseilles already was that not the objective the the meeting in marseilles the there especially the was at the framework the the euromediterranean cooperation means to the
the november has the european union the again expressed on the situation in the east this time in more very because the deterioration the the situation the ground
we continue us the full working and in several respects will the next days or weeks progress made can be
the most is and remains and that is also your position that there as quickly possible a end is the the violence and that the parties without conditions ex the negotiations the content area can resume
further makes the mr solana part from the the committee the sunday in new york unequivocally and the to we hope quickly the the work will to
and the finally  i itself behalf the presidency a visit the the region to to after the summit the nice in following the the work that than done will are by this committee
the presidency has the effort to the relations the the union with the other large regional cooperation further to develop through different meetings with our asian partners including the third  a summit with japan and a summit with china
earlier already under the portuguese presidency has a summit place with india and with the association the crises countries will still a meeting the ministerial level place
in the  have we a small problem had but i would there here the want point that the issue itself nothing to make has with the establishment the diplomatic relations what that the is the certainly at the the necessary number the but that is not the core the the matter because some countries have already years diplomatic relations with north other countries at not
we have simply decided us are to the with the core the us policy on north the november have we to a number policies the and the basis the the guidelines has the european troika a visit the north can to
our dialogue with africa is the all levels also the ministerial level very close been with particularly with the  but also with the sadec in the framework which the this at moreover still discussions place
also with latin america have we the dialogue continue there are general discussions held in new york in the margin the the general sitting but we have also about on a number specific points as the support the the european union for the peace in colombia and the social economic and institutional projects the president pastrana
i like this overview not conclude without to point the the policy the the union the regard the the socalled large broad or horizontal issues with particularly the human the this area must there still hard work be to the cohesion the the european policy in the different international structures to increase as the cooperation with the civil
the this point have we the earlier deploys efforts continue
the second celebrate the the annual the the european union on the human is the the european parliament presented and the december will a forum on the human place in paris
further has the french presidency the policy the promotion and strengthening the the treaties on disarmament and  continue as the also active has part the the preparations for the conference in on the illegal trade in light arms and arms the small calibre
the presidency has also the second annual prepared on the application the the code on exports and the that that there long progress made is this report will the december by the council general affairs approved must be
despite the fact that i my speech significant i must some can you see that the european union its activities the all mentioned areas significant the the enlargement is and the the activities the by already our international negotiating large gentlemen granted
the conclude would i still want say that the council the by the mr brok expressed concern on afghanistan shares
i i that that the union a number measures effect the basis the a common position the january a fully embargo the arms political pressure the the parties support the the birdal the the international community support the the birdal the leading afghan leaders drugs and aid the the civil population
on this issue would the commission doubt the necessary can say if they this the time would have but the is that the that all efforts the we now make to this  country to aid to to rearguard continue as the neighbouring or other countries the the any way the this problem involved are and influence have in this country refuse final a end to make the their interventions and speeches
far is the the this at certainly still not and the regime remains far hand for the arguments and the pressure the outside
i would like want that i could say that thanks the pressure the we exercise and the actions the we take the situation the the good too but unfortunately will the circumstances in afghanistan very obstinate to are and as difficult to influence that this type actions far not effect has
that is however not reason to the the tackle the to are
we must our actions continue and i know that many members in this chamber this very sensitive are
we will than also further to the this way
this is although a specific subject but the is also a specific question the is the and therefore mr the president wanted i this answer still just give
mr the president gentlemen members i aware that i by the floor to you to up a contribution bonino to a momentous development in the history the europe because the is to i believe for the first that a minister the defence the floor the in your parliament
the october i i in your commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence report done the the progress the the creation the a european defence
the does i welcome that i in following this today in your sitting the results can explain the our conference on the staggered the capabilities the november on
i would first my assent want express with the paragraph in your resolution the november the the has the the european security and defence
that policy as read i has not to objective to compete with the atlantic alliance that the basis remains the the collective defence the the allies and is there not the at a permanent european army the the mislead to to
the presidency is the with the wording agree and that applies i i also for all national authorities
us objective is before in the to are our forces joint in to to to the tasks from to to when the european council the decision the a military operation from to to under responsibility the the union
what the military capabilities the a important point have the member in helsinki the the objective the that the union before in the must are within days and for the duration the the least a year a force the the mislead to to the terms extent to compare is with a  that like say a force the soldiers
the force would in military respect autonomous must can function and less must are with a own  a own supervisory a own intelligence and a number other support units further would this troops support must to from the air and from sea
our member have during the european council the helsinki the a year ago also decided the short term joint objectives the to to the regard the strategic capabilities
the fifteen had the difficult task this objectives to into in military and technical capabilities and the task have they to a good end know to to
i would here want point the the quality the this not earlier done work the are done by a number military experts from our countries and under leadership were the the military  that only in march in the life established is
also would i want point the the force and the effectiveness the the cooperation with the atlantic alliance which a fruitful exchange is the on the development the this new capabilities
we have now than also on detailed documents for military planning the recently are adopted in the council general affairs
the is the in the first place to a list the capabilities a document the page programmes which very precise the say what military capabilities by our union if necessary be as to all tasks to can out
i i that that the tasks very diverse are humanitarian aid same the the population prevention but also separation the the warring parties with use the violence
we have now therefore on a list the capabilities the approved is by all countries the the union
also have we now the available on a list the troops which the the what contribution any member the the force like make the basis the voluntary
the contribute the during the mentioned conference the november by the fifteen are confirmed forms a users the more than any approximately fighterplanes and 
in terms respect can with this contribute than also fully meet has be the the objective the is the by the council
i would two comments want make to the the this figures which i course still many other figures would can add
that will i however not do because i like the record the
this figures have the the a force the for a operation the the european union during the least a year in the taken must be this means that each country the relation the the appropriations contribution on sufficient reserve must have to the necessary repayment possible to make
further i i the figure the any mentioned but that like not say that we to to further to to than the in helsinki the objective the the this figure the that we sufficient postulated and  behind the hand have to ensure to ensure that the number the that the council the the objective the has to all time achieved can be irrespective the circumstances which the military from under the their appeal the certainly at situation
i would in the briefly further want like the this figures to clear to make that the european union already has they than decided the from to rest with military capabilities the reality not from the view must lose this capabilities must reliable and credible are
all present here understand because and itself am i from personal experience that a democratic political authority that decision troops in to to when the faced the with a not to tolerate seen the violence the the not can afford the there but the to plunge the must fully the are force can confidence
in the conclusions the the mentioned conference on the staggered the capabilities to we further than the list which i just about i
we are namely also agreed to work the a qualitative improvement the the force
the member have the to linked the medium and long term both their operational capabilities if their strategic capabilities to increase
more in the particularly have we us proposed to the reform the our forces which mrs lalumière just referred has the to intervene to our own capabilities further to increase and to ensure for a good harmonisation the the existing national or multinationals projects which the performance the our forces improve can be
the is with particularly to a more drivers a wider availability and a better cooperation other what we mention the interoperability the the european forces
the intention is the this way our strategic capabilities to increase with particularly the strategic mobility the that at is the necessary troops quickly the the place the act to to
also want we the this way the directed and structures and the intelligence the for the the structures strengthen
the finally want we also a number capabilities the for the operational actions the the european force increase
the is the with particularly to detection the and save from   for   and logistical support
this series is for a large part line with the suggestions the in your resolution the november done are
i would still a other comment want make on this comprehensive plan the increasing the the european military capabilities
some as the project if a illustration the the shortcomings and weaknesses the the europeans
but i would want say that the shortcomings and weaknesses already very long there and that this to now to from the political by no attention is spent in any case not the european level
thanks the development the we in the have the can the europeans now their responsibilities take forwardlooking act their forces as need use the for the democratic political objectives and decisions take on issues which a large number years large confusion has there
the is here therefore to a new impetus the is based the a expression the political like the our member credible is the impetus only if he also a followup the
therefore have we a followup and  adopted the the hand which the progress measured can be
that instrument will during the european council the nice approved be
the is course based the the  the the european union and the the recognition the the voluntary and political nature the the commitments obligations
the the hand the this instrument will we the future decisions the the member can looking the the earlier made agreements and i i will this mechanism the national authorities encourage and encourage adequate decisions to take
you see therefore that europe determined is a sustainable effort to make to the common defence credible to make
this is the a rapid implementation the the taken decisions need
as said have our fifteen countries the the objective the the european force from operational to make
we would like see that the permanent bodies as quickly possible after the summit the nice set be
in will the system operational made must be that will a the the tasks are for our friends the the swedish presidency
the is the with particularly to the military staff the the european union the quickly will must can have on own facilities and adequate procedures
in will the permanent bodies  are and in the meantime period will the european union a careful beginning can make with the role the certain tasks to far my comments the with the view the the rules the your parliament necessarily record and therefore also incomplete are
this are the specific results to now to the the policy on the military capabilities as the results still not approved are will the approval given be during the european council the nice
with your if mr the president gentlemen members would i very briefly still want point the the large political importance the this new mission the the signed by a majority the the large public and which the union a instrument for the exercise the political influence in hands has been which the its to now to has must
this mission is based the a clear political to the the national authorities a political like the in contrast the with the many disappointment the we since the beginning the the european europe the this area experienced have
i would than also my mr programmes want thank the ministers the foreign affairs and the defence the this substantial step forward possible have made course thank i also the european parliament for are large interest for this new great project
mr the president when we issues if the security and defence and conflict discuss should we never forget what the fundamental had for the european union is this union is in the history the best example the conflict
when we to the last century look see we that we in the first half of two wars have had the  in the history with millions deaths
however have in same century same people in same countries the european union in the life established the principles the the heart the the european union are will when they where than also the world be applied peace to
if we the have on conflict why sent you in place the soldiers not this message why intend you not to given the enormous fundamental experience the the european union the the area the the solution the conflicts within the european commission a section peace and reconciliation and a commissioner for peace and reconciliation in to to
applause the left
and i i to to just in to to the what my much friend the mr hume just said
he has in a part the the world that i good know with are own personal vision the the solution the conflicts more achieved than the most other people for are efforts the that area has he also world rightly recognition been
course has he right with are comment on the contribution the the european union the the solve the conflicts
a  political scientists has in a book written with the dark title the end the the history
now have we itself already again well what history seen since but the one point had he absolutely right we were in indeed witness the the end the a particularly relief and many to long period in the history the europe
we know all that the idea behind the creation the the eu the objective the the fathers the the european union was to to prevent that europe are own sinking would achieve by again a next war
that is moreover not a the the least results the the last few year is achieved because we are the managed to the this continent for the stabilisation the a liberal democracy to ensure the french presidency the for the important task to leadership to give the the completion the this process in nice
with the to the liberal democracy be we now faced with the problem that we a stabilisation for the whole european continent must achieve that is the core the the enlargement and the the enlargement
therefore is the enlargement not only but a strategic issue not only a economic but also a moral matter the is a issue the closely linked is with what the gentlemen member just said with the to the solve the conflicts
i am here however not has to on that subject to speak but to to respond the my much friend the mr brok and the mrs lalumière i thank they both for their excellent reports
by this reports and the the arising motions to we the available on a number very ambitious guidelines for our future work
i am grateful that they on the general the external action the the european union in high extent support the policy the that area is developed by the council the commission and since are office something more than a year ago my mr javier solana
i am the the i agree with the thrust the this resolutions and reports
the would not sense are to evening in to to the all points the in this reports and motions the the item be the this is further also not the at to us entire foreign policy on the whole world under the look to take
in place of like i only a few comments make on a number important elements in the two reports on the  and the common foreign and security
the ministers have in their speeches already out the the important developments in the last weeks with the to a increasing the the european contribution the the own safety the europe
i will here not repeat what they already have said and also and that i i already very often clear made are the military aspects not matter for the european commission
the are not i repeat not affairs for the european commission
the only knowledge the i perhaps in this discussion can input is in my capacity if former commanderinchief the the  in hong hong
this is rightly a issue for the member
the is very clear a subject where the ministers responsible are for the decisionmaking
the is not matter for the european commissioners
i think some comments on the up the this force in the country that i i best know extremely odd
there the they that the nato this the undermined but the nato has already very clear to know given that they the plans the the european ministers supports
there the also they that the united states objection would have
in a the the english headlines the last sunday was usa draw the back from nato if eu notion the own become while the government the the united states precisely a large favour the that initiative is
time if representatives the the american government stress how they the european plans support published there again someone in the media in my country to to tell that they not really understand what for their the best is
any time if this happening the again someone otherwise going waved usually someone from a previous government or from a community period in our transatlantic relations the tells that the things changed are and that this development certainly harmful consequences will have for the relationship between europe and the united states
clear is in any case the next the first would the relationship between the european union and the united states only really worse if we the current proposals not would out if we our intends not successful in the practice to
the second is there still a other issue where not misunderstanding on must there
no that that the united states the plan are to their strategic agreements with europe the to build
what people the however still more achieve is that in the american public opinion the resistance will grow and that is understandable to the lives the americans to risk because the consequences the the bloody small european tragedies
the the runup to the bombing the yugoslavia during the kosovo was i in the united states i i this the discussions the   live and all elsewhere followed
the thrust the all discussions was exactly line with the picture that i you just talking
as i already i said is the clear that our relations with the united states very adverse affected will be if we not more for ourselves do
in the recent history the bosnia have we a situation given which a number the our soldiers often in unacceptable situations  not only the military but also the moral area
the recent events in kosovo emphasise how important the is that europe more are own triptych is triptych
that try we now also to do and honest said think i the both rather if  that there suggested the that the our intention is to a european army to create or that we the americans europe from want into
i am the at agree with what my gentlemen friend the mr brok said has in are general conclusions on the common foreign and security
we have many achieved since the decision in in maastricht to a step to to in the direction the a political cooperation to a common foreign policy
there must however also still many done to a sound cfsp to develop
there is need the a further strengthening the the cohesion and effectiveness in the external activities the the european union the basis the a  approach
the experience the the last few year have demonstrated that for the external action the the european union more need is than a linking the good proposals the technical cooperation
we will three  must into to a coherent whole the community policy the cfsp with including the the  and the national actions by the member
the is necessary that we the external area not only a sense and understanding partnership create between the institutions the the union including the european parliament but also a very intensive coordination with the member
we are for the challenge to ensure to ensure that the the group the  and donor the development the world also are political presence late see
we are in the to a fundamental contribution to make and this must we not for shrink
this has for the community to result that we our external support must reform that we our internal procedures must improve and that we a framework must create which we the whole range the community instruments can mobilise the support the the agreed external objectives we are not the find to new instruments
we have also not new instruments need
we want only but the powers which we already under the treaty have more exercise the parliament has same wish expressed and this am i course very welcome that
in are speech pointed minister védrine the the priority the we the the reform the us external action have given and the the more and rebuilt implementation the our programmes
i i this subject already a number times in the parliament discussed and i like this today not again to many time the to
we have however the progress made and that is mainly to thank the the leading role the the french presidency the this area has played
we have particularly efficient worked to to ensure that the programmes the we to out also can count the the assent the the european taxpayers and that the beneficiaries in countries on the whole world the necessary aid as quickly possible to because we first the projects with the highest priority will support
the is i not noted that the gentlemen member in are report stated to common strategies to develop for africa latin america and the western balkans
what the western balkans the am i the not with him agree that we a common strategy must develop we have namely already on a properly good strategy for the western balkans
that was also back in the report that javier solana and i earlier this year the the council have presented
the this at are we for the challenge to the to continue the the the strategy and to ensure that the strategy also effect has we must the western balkans a perspective offer the a reinforced link with the european family so the countries in the region encouraged be to the economic and political changes and reforms by to to the necessary are for their stability and prosperity the longer term
i like the gentlemen member mrs lalumière thank for the explanatory the its report on prevention the commission affects the this area preparations in consultation with the high representative for the european council in nice
the commission is intends to the next spring the this report to respond with a communication on the way which prevention on the whole acrosstheboard integrated would can be in the programming the the area the external support
the september has the commission a decision on crisis adopted the for the the create the a community mechanism for the coordination the civil  in emergency
this decision is now the the council and i hope the i that the soon adopted will be
with the regulation on the up the a rapid  the for the end the this year adopted would must be the the commission the possibility to the basis the one line and one legal with a broad range the instruments quickly to can respond the a crisis because a number actions parallel carried can be
i like in that the still only one thing repeat we have the on a rapid 
that is what the commission like would want
the commission is further not involved the the up the the rapid become
i i the again the the not always whole balanced and objective media in my own country the quite what effort seem to have with that distinction
we are favour the a administrative measure a measure which the sometimes what slow commission more can respond in crisis
even for the required procedures the we within the commission apply have we not need the a force the any to our objectives to achieve
where we the need the have is the support the the parliament so this proposals as quickly possible adopted be
just as the minister will i briefly respond the the comments the the gentlemen member the mr brok on afghanistan
we are just as concerned if the minister on the recent increase the the fighting in the northeast the afghanistan we make us also ensure on the crisis humanitarian circumstances for the population the of the result are
thousands people are from their homes fled to the ceasefire to but under the common position the the european union on afghanistan the january the this year has the union the under other to objective the to a sustainable peace in afghanistan to achieve
this the support given the the central role the the united nations to by means the its special envoy the mr  the parties in the conflict such further to other to to that there in that country a government with a broad support can be up
the european union has also other attempts encouraged to the peace in afghanistan to achieve as the the the  and the initiatives the the former king and the the organisation the the islamic conference
same remains the european union there the countries the the quiet in the conflict the insist to their military and paramilitary staff and their intelligence from afghanistan back to draw and to all other military support the the involved parties the the conflict to end
with the to the aid the humanitarian area has the commission the last year especially by the bureau for humanitarian aid echo a number specific interventions carried to the need in that country if result the the disastrous drought to relieve and aid to offer the the population the fled is if result the the fighting in the northeast the the country in that the are financial resources the available the the for the the food and for 
to now to is the this year to a total amount the million euro the sent and appropriations financial support
also have member also still individual contribute provided
to finally can also i emphasise what already by others is said
we have extremely many achieved in a remarkable short time
there are people the find that the european union sometimes the  there or the the union blame that they not in the is to initiatives to develop to vision to show to the further to develop to to can respond the the problems in the modern world this people would perhaps agree must look to the progress the the last months in a very short period is made with the to the create the a cfsp with a own integrity and with very considerable new opportunities
the is a remarkable contribution
i hope that we in the commission in the will are to a contribution to make the the sensible discussion on prevention
our other large contribution will must are that we let see that we the already the us  tasks also many more can out than in the past the case is been
you thank commissioner patten
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
mr the president the mr brok has very good clear made what our group take the the progress the are made the defence and how they think on the way the we still to to have the this area
mrs lalumière like i here only say that the group its excellent report tomorrow will support
i like i in my speech concentrate the the situation in afghanistan
in june am i itself in that area been and i i when not only the misery circumstances given which the refugees situation but also knowledge made with the fanaticism the the grounds which i i can speak
since the fall the  in september the to the first resolution the us parliament and to the debate the today is the situation with the day worse become in the particularly in humanitarian respect
by the  the  is the only  to the  and the  off this are not only the troops the commander massoud  but this is the also a large part the the driven and  population
as we earlier already said have is a military solution in this area without more excluded and i i just than also with interest knowledge taken the the statements the the presidency the the council the the willingness has expressed all possible pressure from to exercise the the neighbouring with particularly pakistan to a end to make the the interventions in this area and to seek to a political solution
but i say the still but agree we must us especially up the the humanitarian on the the matter because the situation the how longer how even
in the  the the  and in the north the the country that from tajikistan still still very difficult reached is are the the this at more than families the everything say are and which the half even not side over the head has
the half that like say families
currently is the this to degrees under zero and the only food that this families the last month received have is a europe meal
there must than also with large urgency a humanitarian  the the the be
i believe fact that therefore already asked is
there must a  to in  and i i must we also consider in other times and the other places have we the also done a airlift the to to
the is a issue the life or death for this people
president i will my contribution concentrate the the report the mrs lalumière
behalf the whole group like i my appreciation express for the excellent report the  lalumière our very gentlemen mr
my group supports its drafting and we are grateful for the balanced text which the right points be the
we to because a new approach the the common foreign and security which the civil component the are least equal is the the military
the rapid force seems with drive to the to to which our congratulate
the member have commitments done the right do the earlier expressed ambitions
now is the that the the also a effective efficient european unity to forging the under clear leadership will are
that will the real test for the european union be in my view
there the a new dimension the the common foreign and security added
that makes the question to a good parliamentary control godsend
parts the council and the commission the proposals in the report topic
we make still two other comments
the described developments are a new incentive for the european arms and the can they use
but we want  prevent and want therefore the  improve and we will also a amendment in the sense support
my group recognises that there discussion will the on the various aspects but looking in the first body to new resources through restructuring
we the a any increase the the defence not from but that will the the examined must be also in line with other priorities the example social and economic area
us like in the report course very the emphasis the the civil component the the common foreign and security
the impression the  raised that the future the the cfsp the or is with the up the a autonomous military capacity
is that rightly
according the press in any  not
the rapid become is intended for the implementation the tasks
we must the importance of however not subjects
i am the although not agree with the cynics the say that europe there a unusable plaything the the the is however where that in many situations the rapid become not immediately employed will are
we see its if a instrument that addition other used can be or better said if possible arguing other instruments
prevention has the prefer over military crisis
the eu is better less than example the nato for such 
we wish strengthening the the capacity
we are sometimes sceptical on the efforts the the european union the matter
there is a type  the the the military instrument
the that point seem results easier to to
the the second part the the decisions the helsinki the in our view often lip proven
the a such criticism the than often responded with a reference to the headline goals for requests or the rapid  the now by the commission the concert the the
we support this steps but there must more done to the civil aspects the the european security to strengthen
we want scenarios and a coherent planning
when have we what instruments need
the secret the the european union is its civil basis that want we clear in the foreign policy the the union to expression the see
mr the president mr the presidentinoffice the take often long for there visible results are if issues the european level be dealt
 citizens complain agreed that the european bureaucratic reject very slowly come
within the european security is the development however astonishing quickly has since there in december in helsinki decided is that there a common european peacemaking must to
the is a good matter that the there is
we must ourselves and the world let see that europe the force and the like has to tragedies as the the balkans in the future to prevent
course must the eu more responsibility take in the direct vicinity the the union what the prevention crisis missions etc
the group the fully behind the brok
we support in large lines also the report
we are however the opinion that the important to not  structures with the nato to develop not often enough stressed can be
the seems therefore somewhat unnecessary to already to detailed to regulate how example a european  organised must be
the is the important to the transatlantic link and the permanent involvement the the united states the europe to retain
the eu must not own fixed  to the to
as said is the development quickly
in the one after the other country is the last week indicated how soldiers aircraft adds etc the countries can make for the operational make the the peacemaking
if the the debate in a number member follows the the clear that the development for many citizens somewhat confusion is
commissioner patten were report from the the debate in britain
in a another country that i after the the heart is the a reasonable subscribing discussion held
in sweden the a somewhat  debate held on the neutrality a understanding which the most know that the a serving is the the cold war that today the day not more the application is
therefore have we in the european parliament a more to greater responsibility to this debate to to and the in development having defence and security critical to into and to discuss
that means that there for us parliamentarians structures must to so we information on the decisions can to can debate participate and responsibility can demands
also the citizens must so possible access to information and documents to
that is a important condition for the political to confidence to win
the socalled  the last summer was in the parliament been criticised
the the in that activities the the area the the foreign and security undertakings are the control
that is course unacceptable
therefore have we the court asked to this decision to into
same ideas on so possible transparency were to expression in the cashman that we two weeks ago in strasbourg with a large majority have adopted
i hope therefore the a broad support for the amendments the the liberal groups on this issues on transparency and control the the citizens
the conclude like i the large concern the my group to expression to on the still worst situation in afghanistan i like the commission and the council call their effort best to do and their efforts for a peaceful solution to increase and the civil to support with particularly now the winter for the door the
president mr richard commissioner i like i in my contribution to to two important parts the the report the mrs lalumière
the first part is the part on prevention and management
i am welcome that that part such important part part the its report because the based is the the analysis the i say the honest by the greens already earlier and more is made with particularly that the force the the european union the is in the prevent the conflicts and that the only in last body unfortunately back will must can the the military resources
a good example of think i the pact for the balkans
the is what i the a example the how the the must in the european union how with many resources example the the area the democracy example in the support the free media example the the area the education and demonstrated the that a  political help and worked the the these the
what i the hope and in the sense can i mr wiersma willing is that the words the in the report are on prevention not only lip are but also actually in the practice be into in specific objectives where money and political like in invested the otherwise are we still many further the house namely that we the fine promise and the bad do
the second part where i the back like to is the military part
this are two criticisms the my group the to our satisfaction in the report the mrs lalumière are view
the first is the role the the european parliament also already by several colleagues mentioned
the remains completely unclear in the current proposals what the role would must are
what i the would the must are that the european parliament in the future the the up the the needed strategic concept directly involved the and also in the future if the far is the the decision on the commitment the the european force
the that point i i a very specific question the the mr richard
in the dutch press crop still again reports the that in the agreement the  malo what are country with england closed has beginning this year that this a secret protocol the is which both countries france and england say and everything promise that the european parliament never control will to on any part the the security
i like the mr richard like to are response this questions and him questions what according him the the role the the european parliament would must are if that secret protocol there not is
second point the criticism also that is included in the report the mrs lalumière is the lack the any strategic concept
to the very simple to say where when and how would in the future the european force must action
i is that completely unclear
i was than also deviated dismayed honest said previous week when the mr solana the the question or there the a strategic concept is support yes said yes we have a strategic concept we have only still but the troops need
i like the mr richard the that point questions or he the agree is with the mr solana
is there a strategic concept
and if that there is can he i than demonstrate where that the because than would i that like read
the finally a point the criticism that unfortunately not in the report the mrs lalumière is included is the financial aspect
i think that the message the the european parliament clearly and ready must are we support this development but this should the that savings the the the current disposal armies so the possible the to to invest in new resources the also we need find
mr the president mr the president the the council mr the vicepresident the the commission a other member the my group the mr modrow will will the floor to on the 
i will i the my on concentrate the what in the brok the cornerstone the the common foreign and security mentioned the the enforcement the peace and freedom and prevention
i will i to to one example a extremely topical example that very good clear makes what there in us policy must change the east
what this subject the regrets the mr brok rightly i quote the persistent inability the the union a constructive role to play and the this point the the french presidency not the discussion
i am just back the a visit the israel and the palestinian areas where i the last week a delegation the my group led i
i can you say that the expectations the the palestinians the regard the europe thereof are
with the european flag the the car has the all access even to the most miserable camps
we should this people not disappoint
but what expect they exactly the us
fact is the to three affairs three affairs the within us scope are provided we and with we mean i the union and all national governments a small little political courage can people
the first what the the us expect is that we insist the the send the international observers the protection the the population
i repeat only what mrs robinson already has informed the the high commissioner for the human the the un not more but also not less
what we example given have in the hospital the gaza is downright 
this must really a end to
if you still doubt than can i you economic a interview to read that the november on is published in the rural israeli newspaper  the the freudian what less orders the israeli  have been for the support the palestinians the over are than year
that interview makes also clear why the balance the the two months accept  as  is deaths for the the part palestinians and almost injured which many for the life disabled are
in the second place would we the courage must have the israeli government to questions a end to make the the military violence as that expressions is there because not few hope the peace
by that clear to make should we us not hostile but responsible and act we in the  important the israel and all countries the the mediterranean
course must we all forms the violence towards israeli citizens strict to condemn as the appalling attack the a bus
that have we the ground also immediately done
but as israel continues with actions if the bomb the gaza and the first the electricity  to the population more failed the to present and the out the many bombing the the also by us eye villages around  is there little hope that the cycle the violence broken can be
in the third place the finally would we must call to the reopen the the peace the basis the same principles if the which we stand in all other region programmes the the world namely respect the the international right the conventions the geneva and the resolutions the the united nations
that like in this case say that there a end must to the the occupation also the the occupation the jerusalem that the settlements  must be and that israel the devoted must recognise
the persistent violations the this fundamental rights while there however already seven year negotiated the and the the arising bitterness are the basis the this uprising
the problems must therefore tackled be to ensure to ensure that the peace sustainable restore can be
moreover that from the opinion and many israelis give the also to that a absolute majority the the israeli population irrespective the political prefer the idea accept the a complete peace with the palestinians which also the  the the settlements part part
a movement the mothers the soldiers in israel says the as we have our children from lebanon  late they than not be the life let for the settlements
therefore mr the president must europe i i to decisions now to action on to to
does europe that the the way the i just i indicated than to we not only meet the the expectations the the palestinian people but promote we also the to to a fair peace in israel itself and present we us the the world if a dignified and respectable partner
than only than there there a opportunity that europe are helplessness in the east and the mediterranean will know to overcome
mr the president like concentrate i i the amendment the the brok the institution the a international tribunal for the  the saddam hussein
the so information on the nature the the current iraqi regime there the not
the   still daily the
nevertheless remains the republic the the fear as saddam  already years ago very is typified by many western politician their underestimated also here within the european parliament
this important assessment can however disastrous consequences have because for saddam hussein is the gulf to own say still long not last
hence also his not indeed to a arsenal the extremely  destruction the to to
who would him this today fact the can against the
he refused already long time 
and resolving between the cruelty iraqi dictator a course arab attack the the the israel yes more still a from jihad a holy war
what is cure more for the hand than a gather  the the potential 
how look the council and the european commission here currently fact against the
the fear seems military that the a european cfsp the regard the this crucial risk for the peace not there is
the consequences the a sloppy  against baghdad are in each case not to out
with a parliament appeal the the need the the iraqi people what there the saddam really the the finance the to relieve the the bullies the the manage components the hands international more free
which
to death and dragon to good in own country both outside
short the is more than time that the un a international tribunal election to all crimes the saddam republic the the fear precise to into and to before
a initiative this would the cfsp the the european union certainly credible make
hence our thanks support the amendment the the brok
mr the president this extremely detailed and informative reports on the progress the the common foreign and security let unfortunately clear see what the weak points the the union the this area are
we have us not the our best on let see the relief and uncoordinated attempts to a intermediary role to play in the conflict in the east illustrate this
i believe that we if europeans for the peace in the east a special responsibility have the we unfortunately not can up and where we appear not against are meet
the unilateral accusations the we also here have must some the condemnation the the one or the the other party in the conflict and the divided between the eu the the vote the the united nations the october a the the rapporteurs has this very rightly criticised have the opportunities the the eu to here a constructive and responsible role to play still further limited
not the different interpretations the the causes the the conflict by the different eu and politicians forms the problem perhaps will the elected that now last recognise
the is only the the the support the a peace and the confidence the the involved parties
all member the the union will both a palestinian the the can survive if the legitimate need the safety the israel must recognise otherwise will the never to a common attitude the regard the the peace to and will europe the the united states all credibility if mediator lose
the conflict in the east would therefore a type  for the efficiency the the european  can be
if we there if europeans not in succeed to independent the the united states a responsible role the us to take than can we that count that the also in other means not confidence in us will have if mediator
mr the president the is not to deny that there the last months considerable progress are made the the area the the common foreign and security and that many the the progress the the high representative to thank are
as the french minister the defence already said is there also the regard the the defence progress made
the council has in record  up and the member have specific commitments done with the to their contribute the the up the a rapid force the mr richard has personally the work the the parliament followed both in the commission foreign affairs if in the plenary sitting
i like the contribute the the french presidency the the progress the the area the the common foreign and security and with the to the defence strong stress i i that with particularly because there in the previous debate on the european council the nice in the general what question were the the the progress the during this presidency are made
the french presidency will not much be assessed the the successes the already with the to the common foreign and security and the defence are success but especially the the results the the european council the nice the results are the essential important for the promote the the european europe
the mr patten said afternoon that he not the whole foreign policy the the european union the encompasses wanted let through and i will that also not do i like i the three points concentrate the additional attention deserve
in the first place is there to the the the  the the german minister the foreign affairs the the  the speech the president chirac in berlin and the the the british prime in prague discussion the also the articles the the italian prime and the swedish minister the foreign affairs the recently in the press are published apply in the discussion
already this tolerance to more the emphasis the the intergovernmental than the the community aspect the the cfsp
the mr  the ideologue the what now the third way is has said that the political influence the the commission total is and that the both must be order to other institutions that like say to the council
we find the action the the commission and the interinstitutional balance however the fundamental important mr the president the the council
in the second place know i in unlike to the previous speaker not or the possible and desirable is that the european union more the the conflict and the recent escalation the the violence in the east does than we now already do especially now the united states the in a transitional are i take the that the st president the the united states soon will be appropriate
i think that this for the european union a good at is to its efforts to double and clear its face to let see in this conflict that the as close us happening
my last comment has the the latin america
i question i the and i will the question to course time also the the mr patten to or the negotiating which the european union and the commission currently with chile and the mercosur in discussion are not must be review the guidelines are namely adopted with the view the the summit the seattle the the a failure is 
the is the question or the not discriminatory is the conclusion the this agreements the a new continue to let depend i think the the and think that this discriminatory condition the the now proposal circumstances must be adapted
mr the president i like finally say that we the interinstitutional balance very important find and that the commission the role must can play the its s the internal force the the european union the still document forms favour must correspond with the way which the union the to outside to presenting
mr the president mr the minister mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen we deal today two extremely important reports and a important resolution on the terrible unacceptable situation in afghanistan
despite like i the especially have on the report because the comes the the progress the the european security and defence certainly has made and there a balanced and democratic framework for outlines
balanced because the report very clear the that we in the first place a analysis the the watered in and the europe need have in the second place prevention and in the third place civil crisis
only if that all nothing why can we our resort take to military crisis
this will in the practice not always after other can done but already this ingredients are essential for a balanced security and defence in europe
i like here however especially stress that the report also a democratic framework outlines
mr the minister i like you thank for the fact that you to our commission you has and that you today here you
your personal commitment can the democratic legitimacy the the european security and defence however not replace the defence and the issue the the defence are a national matter
the support that and the decisionmaking must the the level the the member and in the national parliaments place
but also is there the european level the the security the european parliament is if budgetary the the european level responsible for the security
we have need the cooperation between the national and the european level and we have democratic support need
mr the minister i know that you here sceptical the the you has now again no said the a previous opportunity in paris has you already agree no said but from the the question to what party we properly this parliament will the this continue working and the will try this for other to to
rest i to say the you the european defence also a  dimension
mr the president i will my intervention concentrate the the report the mrs lalumière that to my opinion good and clear is up
the the the summit in helsinki taken decision on the up the a rapid european force the in the member the different ways interpreted
in finland and sweden clearly the the crisis which in the countries especially the traditional personnel the intended
the report the mrs lalumière reflect the idea the several  that the  already free quickly a full army the that in the is war to to
that army must under other the available to on heavy    and  for long 
on is the get nothing told
to my opinion must the military identity the europe be built within the framework the the nato which the european union the to crisis limited
i can the development the the european union to a military alliance and a military power not accept
now the development the the european military dimension the the is the is the sensible to to to that the union also the that point internal fast
the nato can a defence within the union forms the if strong european pillar the the nato fact
the the way can the other member the the european union the to the traditional personnel to
i can certain details in the report the mrs lalumière not accept the the final vote will i against the report vote
mr the president best mr programmes the european union has its comprises far not can up to the responsibility the the to take for the peace and especially for sustainable stability in the world
and that while they not real competitors would have if they the existing instruments and especially the existing potential for the civil prevention would improve and coherent would working
the  activity the after the tragedy the kosovo is however at the wrong on from
the concentration the a fully has crisis has the common foreign and security totally distortions
and that while however not only country the responsibility the the would take to are soldiers without political plan and with insecure end to a region from to send
we have not political plan and in reality there there also not common foreign and security
the national interests to still always the dominated with particularly the the area the the foreign policy
of have we recently still a example given in den hague
this the also eclipse in the conflict in the east
the is absurd to the european foreign policy to separate the the institutions the the most instruments for the implementation that under their management have been
this sense arrived not the i but the commissioner patten and he refers the the negotiated the are it
the is already just absurd to the financial resources mainly to concentrate the the military equipment
when the european foreign policy the in the first place as if instrument the support the the european arms than the the are politics wrong
the can are credibility only restore when the civil approach the highest principle the and when the with the existing instruments a effective policy the and this sufficient financial resources the available the
the neglect the the broad instruments for the civil prevention will the longer term a mistake will i can not pleased take with the statements the the council that we now once certain decisions have taken and that the therefore the on from must to
clear is the nor because same that that this decisions also only but in the has approach for
civil prevention with the emphasis the the floor prevention can not only a tack the the military intervention are
they can only effect effects if we us from the the traumatised the kosovo and his and when we return to a active policy and time use make the the existing resources and when we crises and the risk the escalation can refute
that means that actions the prevent the flows to continual region programmes the highest objective the the council must are that there a honest trade must to that there aid must to for sustainable development and especially that the democratic forces in the civil society must be supported
also the support the regional cooperation is a sense means
the problem the the eu is that they the interest the the public opinion not hot has can make for such actions although they many more and more are
mr the president a german conservative member the mr brok and a french democrat have their forces adopt and with the presentation the this two other supplementary reports and motions a would i say  axle to the the the a trying even the another the challenge the to to in the glorification the the  militaristic
this resolutions plus the interventions the the ministers the foreign affairs and defence and the the the mr patten let there not few doubt on there that the the plan is the european union still more to kowtows and still  to make
in both motions the  support expressed the the achieve the a terrible heaping with if at the rapid become the or man man says us the mr richard and with support from the air the sea and with the commitment even the 
the official with  cynicism adopted objective is the european union the possibility to offer to without previous permission the the united nations and with only a call by the secretarygeneral military to can intervene the the territory the third countries and this crises to prevent or to manage the a threat can are for the values and the interests the the european union
in the two resolutions be the criminal objectives the the notorious cfsp explained and the proposed in all member the the european union  that like say  in to to the course blindly the their given recommend will follow
than will the says the with still more success interventions can out as the criminal bombing in yugoslavia and the still still continuing occupation the kosovo and can also the european union this the initiative take in consultation with the nato or if supplement this
i must here there also the point that according the mr brok the objective the the cfsp is the massive attack the the on the the superpower the head to offer
probably is him unfortunately for the humanity would i say still not the reconfirmed has that there not superpower more there
the truth is there but one as in the time for is also now again for our rapporteurs and for the leaders the the european union the people the enemy the people that refuses the head to the for the new imperialist item the people that the opposition
that is the enemy where the cfsp against is at
you understand probably the that we against the two motions vote we give you also the a economies that we us with heart and soul will turn the the fight against the policy that
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president i like the with particularly have on the report the mrs lalumière where i the the possible respect for i because i the a report think that very practical doing on affairs on our safety and also the safety the others to us across
but i would you first something want say on a number statements the my colleagues earlier were
they speak very agreement and gesture on the order the efforts namely first preventive action so possible peaceful resources and than only military resources
if you that should than say you yes that is course where but the call suggests in fact that the european union and the european member in a another the in the past many to quickly to the arms have matter
the history from us that the unfortunately often many to late was and that if the something earlier was has hundreds lives had can be spared
therefore i think that the to the as to to fact not precisely is
however support i the i the efforts to the preventive action to do the regard the the prevent the war and what for violence than also but we must the matter course not order
i am the opinion mr the president that the as is that the public opinion if you the  also think that we here in the european parliament are are with foreign political and safety and that this also the both the our  is what not the case is
the fact is that the council the fifteen ministers on decision and that the all free slow process and that the european parliament this the debt the the
i am than also extremely welcome that we however progress make
there is also the action the the french minister the defence in us central what however a historic event is been
the content the are speech was something where we us all the have can about
we have can see that there course progress is
also the efforts the the mr patten the us also very popular just as the mr solana welcome we the i to because there last what happening
i think the also a extremely practical comment in the report the mrs lalumière where they says good coordination between member by mr solana more initiative from the commission by commissioner patten
the as still this two let merge to one 
i i used also the agree said the are least a   but the merger is still many better in the framework the the european commission
i think the a extremely good perspective what mrs lalumière outlines
the such way can we there perhaps to to that already our resources also the a more way be used both the for preventive actions if for military actions as need in the framework the petersberg and the action after military action as example now in kosovo also need is
this have we need the officers but also people the the administration behaviour can the the example the function the mayor somewhere can accept
that are all officials which i think that the in the portfolio the the mr patten extremely good the the item can to and are rapid reaction facility
that is a extremely important element because the european commission this many control on has and we if parliament therefore many control
therefore i am the inclined to that a very been emphasis to give
mr the president than is course still the budget how that divided must be
there are good comments in the report and i think that we there with mrs lalumière the prefer the must give to that through the budget to finance than the the immediately also honest divided and is there also also control the
what the the control must the european parliament course still more the tasks the the western union and are assembly accept
i think that the good is
i think also that the time a cautious realistic assessment is that what the the practical commitment the troops the national parliaments however very long and perhaps the always a large competence will the and that therefore a forum necessary is which we the national parliaments from this under also can meet
not a supervisory but a forum and i welcome that the i to
mr the president this report is a cheque for the eu to itself for military interventions ready to prepare
i think that unacceptable
when the the additional regard that the warsaw divided would the has the  under my leadership beginning a new military doctrine approved with if objectives not weapons a  between the countries and a gradual disarmament
nonviolence was us principle
by the end the the confrontation between the two power is the nato unnecessary become
but in place the that they the dissolved the they the a defence in a  and behaves alliance changed and they extends its moves still further to the east from
the justification for the creation the a  the today seem the the arguments for the existence the the nato
the is not in the first place to the put the means but to the military ashore the the access to markets materials and established interests
i am ensure that the eu the the the area the the foreign and security further  for the enforcement the the peace and the the the united states level but this are other liege for need
the first the in fight with the law pursued war against yugoslavia and the results see the new tensions in the south the serbia show the that military violence not again a political means must be
the second the nato must step for step be dissolved and not to the east be extended
the third there must a  corridor the the baltic to the black sea be up as olaf  ever proposed
the fourth the osce must be strengthened and the basis the its  principles be equipped with adequate resources for the prevention and the end the conflicts there must not  in the life be established
the fifth the united nations must urgent be asked to a summit for the peace to organise which lessons be drawn from the wars the the twentieth century to for the peoples the this earth the perspective the a peaceful st century to open
europe would the example can give but the up the a force is this certainly a wrong signal
i must say that there many things in the brok are the we can support with particularly the important that the adopted the the the enlargement the the european union
we see however also still few problems with particularly with the to the nature the the common european security and defence
i concerned this comment despite the massive amount  the us the last days remarkable enough on this subject have achieved
if the proposed european capabilities indeed intended would are to the nato to strengthen or the opportunities the the alliance to increase would we this little problems that have
that is however not the case
the union is determined to a autonomous force the to up in the framework the a greater police integration in europe
the mr richard says that he not with the nato like compete but he like the with america compete the the area the the security
addition few other wish the the mr brok also for to the objectives the the european union the military area to up the the instability regions in asia the afghanistan to the the chinese sea
he mentioned under other kashmir and that think i alarming
in the report the proposed to the military operations the the eu to finance from the community budget also those the not the the operations participate would this that must pay
there is a proposal to russia to questions to air on long distances from to to yesterday made the russians for to together with the european union activities the the area the the intelligence to take
there are here apparently certain people the would russia if strategic partner would want than america
mrs lalumière and the mr brok would like see that the defence the the eu under leadership the the a vicepresident the the commission the the  the the secretarygeneral the the council would must accept
according this plan would the commission in fact the security determine
this are absurd proposals
the commission must the the its civil external significant concentrate the military issues must the intergovernmental basis the the member reserved are
late the nato first decide how they the a crisis would respond before if necessary the europeans a responsibility for a certain task the the take if they this least a greater capacity develop that is four year ago also as in the nato agreed
let we not just do if this also the thrust is the the current proposals
i can you not say how welcome i am with the discovery that the mr brok fact always already a dangerous revolutionary is been
i i to to mrs lalumière to congratulate with its report
we have the last twelve months or concerning clear enormous progress made the the area the the european notable but there are a number things the we not from the view should lose
in the first place must the enforcement the the consistency the the external policy the the european union a central role play
we must ensure ensure that the first second and third pillars together the common objective will achieve
each another mechanism is namely doomed to to failure
in the second place is the attention the last weeks inevitably at been the the military dimension we must however not forget that the need for a civil prevention also remains there
in the third place am i although welcome with the rapid become but we must the clarity create from a european perspective because we but one opportunity to to this good to do
the must not issue are the for the half part and for the other half not all involved member must the there clearly to to force to the the rapid become a success to make
therefore must we also not try to the rapid become with other tasks the to encumber than which this intended is
the nato is course the instrument for the collective defence the europe and the the west
the task the the rapid become is enforcement the the peace and implementation the the tasks
to the tasks from to can to must we on the necessary capabilities to have
the this at have we the that level a considerably deficit and end will the member the planned expenditure this within their defence must reconsider the expenditure differences moreover considerably the country to country
end would i like want that there a greater convergence the defence the
this is also a better coordination need
there must not there are the doubling not within the nato but also not within the member the the eu
we must the basis the a good coordination a better cooperation achieve
we must also ensure for a better european policy for the order the  so there a more industry the the more where for us money is
mr the president i like three things under the attention to the first contains the report a very programme on the way which the eu within future time a military power can be
that is incomprehensible if you involved that europe not enemies has and not threatened the by a military power
the second the report is mainly on aggressive military actions outside the territory the the eu
the power eu must all the world can intervene where the interests or standards and values the the eu be threatened
the this way the the eu also the this area a equivalent the the united states
i am that convinced that the european citizens preconceived the this policy would are if they that the the informed would are
the third in the very comprehensive report the with not floor reference on the nonaligned countries or on nonallied the the
what the closest in the near is is a scott wording in paragraph the the justification on neutral countries
the nonaligned countries must clear protest against such wordings and against the report in are whole
mr the president i like the mr brok congratulate with are paneuropean offensive in both are speech if are report
i voice in with are reasoning on the enlargement
he the the that the negotiations with twelve new member the  instrument are has to the mediterranean and central and eastern to stabilise
we the us there now that are to the all possible ways the conditions for peace and freedom in europe to increase
in the brok the also the function the high representative for the common foreign and security discussed
the the long term is the current situation i i unsustainable
there the evening a exciting debate held
i welcome the unanimity and  to in the way which we in the parliament the this at the report on the security and defence in the union discuss
to credible on to to is the i i the important that the members the the council in brussels and the eu same say if in their own country
in my country sweden demand the minister the foreign affairs a does for 
the debate this is with particularly on in what sweden if eu still still neutral is
the is astonishing but the happening
i think the further very important that the ambitions the the eu now the the day the by specific resources must be followed
otherwise is the opportunity large that the the commitment statement remains
to finally like i say that the important is that the political leaders the the union the current strong ambition clear make so the citizens this important and farreaching plans support
mr the president today deal we two important political reports both to because in fact on the cfsp
this policy will in are history still very what ups and ups know but end will this a essential contribution be made the the published desired political europe
also those the question to the the usefulness the example the decision to up the the socalled army will aware that this decision a very important political component contains and a important impact will have the the cohesion the the european union
peaceful consultations must us dogma are in what case than also if we the cfsp attractive want the must we this foundations the the member
than should we not allow that someone the excluded or criminally than must we ensure ensure that of a strong incentive based to the political cohesion in the european union
contradictions and compromises will course need are
the european parliament must the however they the the line between one the to the the governments to compromises and  and hand the realistic approach the the utopia the the european unification
there do the here also technological issues issues the the area the the research and such for which a thereprovided strategy need is i think the with particularly the the industry the information the  and the space
same must europe to to strengthening the are democratic institutions and improvement the are economic and social cohesion are military ability to action if a men power and are technological head
early or late must the day singlehandedly which europe are own   are own  are own   has
i am welcome with the opportunity to something to can say on the military and certainly also the civil facility with particularly with the view the the next summit in nice
i like the also like my appreciation down see for the first minister the defence the the european parliament has than
that was indeed a historic event
a the the most things the here evening stressed are was the fact that commissioner patten earlier this evening up that we on a military facility talk and not on a european army
i think that we that not often enough can stress
even in some the our own documents the together with reports distributed are the for the us debate here evening is there the example a rapid become and not the a rapid 
i i would many concern these can be if we us clear aware are the that distinction
very unfortunately would i against my mr the orden and also against other colleagues want say my colleagues the the other on the the large  the irish sea have namely so to offer the this area the tradition the experience and the practice
perhaps that we after the elections a balanced debate will have
they have as many to offer
i am disappointed with the position that they on adopt
more will i there not on say
i am however very proud the the irish agreement and the irish contribution
we are a small country that the traditionally neutral right but i am welcome that we now also the the table are and do what we can given the mandate the the irish people
there is not people in europe that philosophical neutral is
some countries are the military neutral and that is what otherwise
ireland is never philosophical neutral been
we have a very clear opinion on atrocities and the not respect the the human in some parts the the world and that let we also quickly and clear see
we have a very clear opinion on our contribution in the ensure the and the maintain the the peace and i hope that we also always in the will are to this a contribution to make
we will never philosophical neutral are the term must also not confused be with military neutrality
thank you the mrs doyle
the first visit the a minister the defence the us parliament is such historic event that we the but programmes night planned have so the shocked for our members not to large would are
mr the president late i start with the two rapporteurs and with particularly my mr  lalumière to congratulate with the reports the here the discussion before
just as the parliament here today does have also the media the last weeks the vicissitudes the the relevant aspects the the european foreign and security
this input i course the the up the a rapid force and the transfer the the powers the the weu the the european union
the must the say that the public debate on this issues more depth has been
despite the differences prevails i i the aware that europe a historic at place which the are role within the international system must defining
also from the recent results the the eurobarometer that that the european citizens an important attach the the common foreign and security
although everyone the agreed agree is that prevention and property the result the other disasters our priority concerns must are will the european union only really credible be as they on the necessary competence has to the humanitarian actions also from military view to support
the progress the we the this level have made must us however to accuracy should
we have need the more clarity and exactitude in all phases the with the construction the the common military  to make have the the  to the  also the responsibility the each the the countries s must better be defined
also must that be ensure that this process democratic process
us i is the european parliament in cooperation with the national parliaments the most appropriate body to this task where to take
i would like the position the the minister this know
mr the president in this debate on all  which everyone are own issue favour take i the floor on afghanistan in the first place to my satisfaction from to speak that the commission foreign affairs my amendment has approved and that the in the text which we tomorrow vote is included
in that amendment is clear to the that the tolerate for  in afghanistan a entire failure is become millions dollars are the the taliban promised and given to the  to put from to eradicate
in place of have they the money provisions and the drugs more than doubled
that is the debt the the maturity  and therefore sorry the i that there a italian the the head the this programme this bureau the but the is also the debt the the irresponsible taliban therefore be they in the resolution rightly condemned
however question i i the or the not possible was the criticism what need what line to formulate and perhaps also pakistan with sanctions to risk because that country supports the taliban more than all other without their support would the regime collapse
why supports pakistan the taliban
to different reasons not in the last place in the hope that the the when they very afghanistan have conquer the kashmir will landfill and the  tensions this again will up
i think that the important is this vicious circle to break we can only but hope that this resolution this will contribute
mr the president gentlemen colleagues i thank mrs lalumière for its very expert report
i like two affairs to the to the civil crisis the the union is not developed while the conflicts social economic theoretical ecological and ethnic the nature are
against already the conflicts is a preventive civil crisis better than a military
my fear is that the still more and more use is make the rapid armies
the european flag the not  by trenches but by social equality and that is a ideological difference
i i for that we a centre for civil crisis up that just as effective and quickly is if planned
as act we in the right order and achieve we our philosophy the the right way
my second fear is that countries the that not want the nato in be through
also this is perhaps a solution russia the the crisis involve
the is to expect that russia often the the a or other way the future crises involved will are
we know also that president putin not very negative the  the what to my opinion means that cooperation possible is since we know to what type crises the is is that to my opinion a another stabilising part the the whole process
the promotes in this issue the mutual understanding between the european peoples
i am very welcome that the ministers the defence and the foreign affairs the the eu previous week decided have to a rapid become the any the to up
i am with particularly welcome that the irish government this initiative deserve supports and committed has that irish any the the become will participate
just as my gentlemen  mr mrs doyle am i i that aware that here not there is the the up the a european army before there in my own country protests against irish participation to sound and that will certainly done like i that point that the participation fully voluntary is and per case examined will be
that said having like i like respond the the comments the a other mr the mr the orden
i think this recent initiative a important first step to the shortcomings in the  the the eu way to work the shortcomings are the such at way the the light has in bosniaherzegovina and also in kosovo
i am the opinion that the lessons the we from this recent events drawn have us in the future good the only will to if we under view see that a european defence based the the necessary capabilities essential is to my idea is that just such essential part the the european integration if the currency
this experience offers us the possibility despite the fear the the mr the orden to us own policy the every way to develop that we our  the not unnecessary against us in the hand present and that we also not stress and tensions within the nato itself cause
the policy the the eu must always based are the a  which to the an to the opportunities the the nato with particularly terms planning and intelligence and terms military parts joint to use in place the the structures the the nato to copy this is with particularly the important because we same common objectives achieve
to my opinion will this experience the european union good the only to the the development the us own defence i hope the i that that policy there would used than later also actually will to
mr the president in the brok on the common foreign and security the in paragraph the next message to the the the european parliament stressed that the for the democratic legitimacy the russia also given the political union between russia and belarus necessary is that the president and the government the russia the clear and strong way the emphasis to the the large need the democratic reforms in belarus with particularly in the light the the report that the october in  is tabled by the parliamentary troika the the european union the council the europe and the osce
i i this amendment formulated that by a large majority in the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence the supported
like russia the the long term join to a political union with a undemocratic 
i like also four people with particularly mention the in the years more are disappeared in belarus and a politician the under unclear circumstances is died
the is to the next people   former minister the home affairs and vicepresident the the e highest  the   vicepresident the the e highest  the belarus and president the a judicial research to president  the mr  friend the vicepresident  and same with him disappeared    the the russian television the the july commission under suspicious circumstances is disappeared the the airport the  and the finally   leader the the civil party and former mayor the  the in august suddenly and under unclear circumstances is died
against the mr patten the mr solana and the way swedish presidency like i the next say into strong and joint the against the antidemocratic  the belarus
mr the president i like you first thank for your concern on the length the this sitting but i can you tell that i year parliamentary experience i and the hand am for such unforeseen circumstances
the the comments the made are on afghanistan like i only still a briefly floor add and the that the council determined is the food the the place the destination to let arrive for far the  that allow
then will i few comments make to the the the excellent debate that here just held is on the reports the the mr brok and mrs lalumière i must my comments course to to a small number parts
i think that the reports in large lines are approved this is course a encouraged for the governments to by to to with their work and think i a support for the summit the nice
i would the first want have on the place the the  within the total political and operational resources the the european union
many speakers have said military resources must only in last body be used within the opportunities which the european union has
i can this principle that also the governments principles course only but emphasise
but what means that in last body
in last body means that all other resources fail have and that is for
in europe have we that half and two year ago in kosovo seen
political and diplomatic efforts or economic sanctions have the wish the the violence in the heart the europe can prevent a unacceptable work in the face the the european values
military force is therefore a last means
but if we want that this force the unacceptable from must he reliable and credible are
i think also that the combination the the different resources a unique feature the the european union is the opportunities offers the work that us to wait the if this political the believe and  is the develop the a real european culture the prevention and 
experience the we have gained and still still taste in the particularly in the balkans show the that the europeans if the to  is in the are expertise and a commendable and do procedure to develop this thanks our experience with a history the rich is the conflicts and us understanding the the subtle and sometimes hard confrontations the population
what the the doubling like i emphasise that the human resources and the military resources the the countries voluntary the the common force make same are if the the most the the nato the available to
there is not there the doubling the 
the is to same troops with same  and availability this applies course not for the countries the not member are the the nato
the countries the member are the the nato need their see however not to double to both the mr if the actions the the european union to can participate
the issue the the concept the concept is introduced in
the is to the tasks
on have the european governments a sound agreement closed and the have we on directives the the to my opinion proven have and the therefore be supported by the public opinion in europe
any missions will course subject are the agreed decisionmaking by the governments as different speakers have said emphasise we in our statements that there not european army there what change that there therefore also not supranational authority is the countries to participation the any military operations can force
europe is therefore not new observes up in unlike to what i believe i a bad informed movement i hear say
we will to work to the basis the national decisions the in cooperation between the governments be taken this decisions be controlled by the national parliaments with respect the the tasks and the principles the the charter the the united nations that makes also part from the our statements
one the the developments the the european security and defence i i is currently is that there a supplementary capacity the the a specific support the the role the the united nations what means that conflicts be resolved and conflict parties be separate
this answered i also the comment the a speaker made has namely that there in  a agreement between britain and france would are closed to the rights the the european parliament to to
this now is not the case
the agreement the in  is closed and the the certainly a agreement between the fifteen countries the the in that a european  if we least want that this practical and effective is only the intergovernmental basis can there
let we not forget that we fifty year long hesitated and fail have in us to the european union a minimum the capacity to give to more than a history observer to are the crises the by to with violence
today the day is intergovernmental action the only possibility
this with already our democratic countries because they the right retain end itself to decide on the working the their peacemaking
by this choice for intergovernmental actions will the parliamentary control therefore indeed mainly the national level place
i i you there moreover the that the council the in are positions never has expressed for a financial obligation the the european union to military actions to finance this will the council also in the future not do
means this now that there not dialogue on defence and safety possible is between the council if representative the the national governments and the european parliament
the seems i that this debate where we all fortunately that are a first proof the the opposite is
i believe that we the way are to a positive dialogue
why
because if we the decisions the we taken have consistent out the responsibility credibility and influence the the european union on crisis gradually will grow
we will not infinitum the the marginalised more are
than will the a indepth political debate develop in our public opinion in our parliaments and also here on what there really the the stake the the crisis through a range the resources which the commitment the troops only but a part is
the depth the the principles and mind in the reports the the mr brok and mrs lalumière give now already the how comprehensive the discussions will are and are there a foreshadow the
we will still ways must think to to reinforced contacts with the national parliaments to to what now however within scenario is and a point is where we think i all fortunately that can are is that the fifteen countries the this union forms countries the already a political reality have created the a positive influence has the the power in the world conscious the roads have found to joint the to act when violence our values doing
that do they the basis the our common values
i think that this good news is
thank you the mr the minister
i i a resolution accordance article member the the rules received to this debate to the
the joint debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
reform the the commission
mr the president gentlemen members gentlemen colleagues the resignation the the commission in march has demonstrated that its structures and way the work urgent must be reformed
the commitment the the reforms which they now working must for everything the restoration the the confidence the the public opinion are
the need the reforms the outside doubt the commission must this a exemplary administration be under the about the the political
only under this condition can the credibility the the construction the the european union restore be
after the reports the the independent experts has the commission the they the the mr kinnock in a paper a reform the its function presented
officially the us parliament consulted to a simple opinion to give but commissioner kinnock has us confirmed how important us position is for the followup the the work the the commission a followup where we the inseparable the involved will be
given the extent the the task were there four committees the involved and is there a new procedure set with four parallel reports
i like the my appreciation express for the work that is done together with my colleagues the the group the the european party the gentlemen pomés ruiz harbour and 
we have therefore elected for a method to without doubling the whole subject to deal
we have us the this method taken and that has the us extended consultation taken
the could we the subject common approach with conservation the the  the any commission and with if objective a real cohesion between our reports
however like i like stress that the for the group very important is that this reform with respect the the treaties the a very pragmatic way the carried
the cohesion the all parts the the reform must ensure ensure that the way which the european europe political managed the for the european citizens clear visible and transparent is
the clearly themselves that the modernise the a structure the as complicated is if the commission the the different participants and in the particularly the the staff  patience and confidence asking
therefore want we not  approach but is the for us the essential important that the whole staff actually involved the the this unity
the reform the although the the summit designed but they must clear are and the the unions and the whole staff be explained so the whole staff also actually involved is the this whole process
we are determined again shipping to to in the european official apparatus and this must we certain principles in eight take for the european official apparatus one only interinstitutional statute retain that any official equal treatment guarantees and really lead to mobility training and training
the hiring must the as develop that equal opportunities for all inhabitants the the community always guaranteed are
the opinion the the committee on the reform concentrate the the this points with respect the our powers
if background remind we there still the that parallel the any legislative all  taken must be within the framework the the annual procedures and the interinstitutional 
the parliament has a special responsibility to the citizens
and if one the the arms the the budgetary must the ensure the the properly use the the public resources
the important is also especially that we there in the future still  the to will see that the approved budget also really by the commission the spent and not the miserly because the not the ability is the few never by to to what us parliament the democratic way decision
the package the measures that in the paper the proposed must there to lead that the commission the all fronts broadcast and more work
we will its support which we there closely the to will see that this procedures as quickly possible lead to a performanceorientated management to  the account the with the  relationship but also with our decisions and with the fact that the decentralisation and delegate the the powers essential is under condition however that the decisionmaking and the provision function assured are
the communication the the european commission must for the different institutions a common message content
specific means this that the the crucial important is new procedures to find to the budget according approval from to to
the not out the the budget the large gap between the budget one and the into the obligations and allotted hand is downright business
we must urgent hoc ad procedures think to the management the the commission again credible to make
this must we the procedures review and achievable objectives the the us in the to within short time the behind behind way to work the gap to close between implementation and payments which a large part the the budget credibility the contracts interim the to suspend if there not cohesion more is between commitments financial obligations and budgetary and subsidies and obligations more from to pay
the credibility the the commission and therefore the the european union the the the stake and therefore must the method the the financial management without be reformed
the medium term is the the essential important to the beginning the any year in good consultation between the budgetary and the commission the legion to brian
as can we prevent that we again in the usual large problems the november or december up are and that we again in a situation up which we the political expectations the the parliament not can up or account can the with a real renewal the the function the the commission
a annual assessment the the development the the method and the the charges the this reform requires consultation the the beginning the any year
this measure will time costs but is inevitably and essential for the success the the reform
there will not only for a  approach must be elected also must there a new nomenklatura be developed the a transparent management possible makes
here are we large those the
we will that ensure that all technical measures carried can be with respect the all rights the the breaking the the parliament
our commission has with pleased noted that the conclusions the the voted on  in the note the changes are adopted
what the comitology the let the member other but already to often their national interests for the interests the the community to consultation the the member process the decisionmaking and working 
the would therefore good are if we the reform opportunity to their intervention to to only for the policies where not expenditure that involved are
i will the not long on the policy have because the mr harbour that will deal
the clearly themselves that the human the the commission not is for the new tasks the its are entrusted late are the tasks the there still the will to the reform where the note the changes the mentions and the only the will the resources certainly not solve
by on thursday in the  the note the changes the main to accept has the council nevertheless proven that he if other branch the the budgetary the reform the our commission supports
what the audit financial management and control the most points of are in the report the the mr pomés ruiz
since november is the position the the commission know on the amendment the the financial rules
we have us already expressed on the reform the the provisional provisional by the report van the to take
however point we there again the that a independent financial control absolutely necessary is
also is the completely illogical that only the council the financial rules can change and we repeat than also us request to codecision the this point
the reform the the commission is a act the the the the important is for the future the our institutions
the method which the conference the presidents has elected and the some somewhat arbitrary alleged has time taken
but this  which we the four reports joint have can as has led to a wider spell vision the the opinion the the parliament has enriched
this report is on the first steps the the reform the the commission a act the very important is for a really modern management the the union
there will still many other reports follow and i for i enriched if i am by this few weeks the consultation would like see that this method in the followup the maintained
i like like in the particularly the three other rapporteurs thank i i our cooperation and the clarify the their positions really appreciated
the differences the there been are were not much the political nature but rather a expression the the cultural differences between the fifteen
they are a expression the the strong different views on the management the the public service the always in the different institutions the the european union life also in our groups
with this reform act also the problems the we on us across to clear for the lot but we know that we here through must how difficult the also is
we have the management the the union modernisation so the transparent the and the better the our citizens way hope are the citizens there the this way still more the convinced that their future is in a still more increasingly european union
and mr the president the does i particularly many pleased to evening last with emphasis the last this report the the parliament to can present
i know still good that the first meeting with the vicepresident the mr kinnock in december a year ago place when the parliament said that i asked would must be to this task the i to take
the has therefore eleven months took before there now last progress is made
i i the period however the if very a perceived
i join i therefore certainly the the what what my mr programmes already have said namely that the team the rapporteurs very good has worked
the was very pleasant to as together to work i am the opinion that there by the involvement the our four committees more depth and content is given the the procedure the must lead to the crucial reform within the commission the for the future the the european union the as large important is
my report address the with particularly the the strategy for 
i stress the term strategy because the commission legal affairs and internal market there still the least two year work the will have we hope course less to all reforms the the regulations the from the  resulting the a sound research to issues
we have there therefore many attention the spent to a strategic framework to create and ensure to ensure that the a good framework is
we are there on the complete given satisfied on but we are also again not complacent i like the a few aspects like which i think that the crucial are for the commission
i will the also say how we can help to the absolutely essential reforms by to to
we have there in our commission very many important the adopted to this subject not isolated to approach but to the precisely in a wider perspective to places we have a very successful public hearing taken which people from the private and public sector are invited to the to give how the environment organisation and departments to us across the the change is
because the new reforms must the commission because the the changes respond because the best people staff must be the a market the very competitive is
the interesting the this discussions was the observation that the ratio and  in the private and public sector still more to other grows all to us across be large organisations still open
they use information the whole new ways they take still more distance the the traditional vertical organisation and both between organisations if by organisations across the still more information shared
this is the crucial lesson the the commission must learn and apply the the fulfil the the reform
given the short time the i here evening is whether can i not the already our specific recommendations like i like i therefore to to that what i the central element the the reform think
we must within the commission to a  to which the any official clear objectives be given in combination with the right resources to the objectives to achieve
this hear also the as important financial resources the as both mrs mr if the mr pomés ruiz have stressed also must officials also the competence to to the resources for the intended objectives the to use
officials must also know the the hand the what objectives their performance assessed be also must they terms salary and promotion rewarded be the basis the the extent which the specific objectives are achieved
this is the central the our proposals
those the within the organisation  can that the structured way and the basis the a better detects do
they should there from to that they the other european institutions into that they the national governments be from or in the private sector to to work
this must the standard to are the a part must forms the the  the the commission
they should there during the career also from to that they with external people to make to the the the commission work the basis the a  contract specialists or young people the three to five year work the the commission if part the their detects see
we must in the framework the a structured detects for the fixed staff the the commission therefore also this external people encourage
in the future will a modern organisation actually the that picture must meet
the strategy true but to everything good to let has must the fulfil also you
for the manage the a organisation is the not enough to on all necessary rules and rules to have there play namely many more essential elements a role as the institution the the staff their dedication the and support for the plans and their willingness to to change
already this aspects are crucial and the is absolutely essential that everyone trade or not this without
leadership from the summit is crucial
vicepresident kinnock is extremely enthusiastic in everything what he does
he has also this procedure with very many enthusiasm led but the process must from the matter level be led
i was very pleased that all four the committees recently the opportunity had to with president prodi to speak
he has us assured that the reforms are full support have
the reforms must from the summit as quickly possible to below  so the european union the strong commission the the they need has to its objectives in the next twenty year to achieve
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues from the the scope the the paper the commissioner kinnock affects the content not directly the the institutional problem
the is the the first stage in a many wider by president prodi  discussion on the governance the the union
a another document on this subject is the the commission in preparation
to the discussion now but right to open has our commission constitutional affairs the than also wonder just if the three other competent committees how effective the policy the the commission now is
is the commission sufficient equipped to the tasks from to to and also the political role to role the its by the treaties are allocated
in a europe that will thirty members counts with a extremely council and a parliament with members the twenty languages speak will the role the the european commission what the the determine and defend the the common european important indeed  are than ever
our commission constitutional affairs remember than also still agree the the fact that they importance the a strong independent effective transparent and political responsible executive commission
order this its to guarantee to we the emphasis the five points
point one the spirit the good governance must the not to to the outright the the commission
also its task the author the legislative must it inspired be example by a internal procedure the respect the the subsidiarity the to to and a  the to the the the  the the procedures to to large delays the the drafting the the texts to avoid
a another important point the commission is the only body that in the is the total road the preparation and implementation the the decisions the europe the to coordinate
this where they that unless see we the clear the the results in the particularly in the second and third pillar
we ask than also the member the commission the role to to confidence in the preparation and implementation the the meetings the the european council and all formations the the council the ministers this is possible without the institutions formally to change
other must the management the the implementation the the european policies and the the the by way appropriations not task are the the commission itself
in the paper the indicated that the the at approximately the half the the officials the the commission the are the with outright
that is to little if we there from would to that the commission itself the outright must out
but that is many to many if we there from to that the commission the must mean the the core the the outright as the us the case is
decentralisation must rule are the favour the the national authorities or external offices
what the the offices must the  on the administration by the three institutions if opportunity the opportunity to a common doctrine the to to for the shipboard
the up the independent offices is still than rightly if specific scientific or technical knowledge requires is or if decentralised policy the prefer seems to have
that was example the case the the european centre for drugs and drug
that will will the case are the the safety the us food and the the aviation but the under condition that we a way the the political responsibility the the commission avoid and that ensure that they the legal opportunities has to responsibility the to to the the parliament and the the council on the way which the offices their task exercise
finally must we us also urgent are the with the external representation the the union
we have this fact afternoon already on about in the framework the the debate on the common foreign policy
as the comments the commissioner patten have demonstrated are we us also here again the the border the good governance and the justify the the institutional reform in already its parts
the commission constitutional affairs the for a general study the to to on the external representation the the union both the third countries if the the international negotiations and in the international organisations and that there research the done to the up the a common diplomatic service
the is the discussion on the governance opened
we will this in the spring continue basis the the conclusions the nice and the basis the the new proposals the the commission
mr the president gentlemen commissioners gentlemen colleagues in the first place want we with particularly mrs mr thank because they the the up the its report constantly to consensus has sought
the committee has effort with  budgeting because the low transparency the the expenditure and because we the powers the the parliament if budgetary want enlargement
as mrs mr the know have we precisely the  with the council completed the who nut the we the have must crack was a clear and precise competences the the respective  the our institutions
the committee take that the parliament are control on the allocation the administrative appropriations not must lose
we find the the not reassurances idea that category the the financial perspectives disappears if  budgeting the introduced
we are not against such consequences but we find that the  the the parliament intact must continue
there would than also already soon interinstitutional problems the if the commission the reform would use to the parliament even the control on this administrative expenditure mugged to make
if the control and the decisionmaking the the parliament the regard the the under the current category areas expenditure however act the left will the parliamentary treatment the the reform the the commission without large surprises has
my group request the commission with urge its effort best to do to the period for the dismantling the the taos to to
we want the commission than also questions or they the guarantee can give that this period really briefly will take
finally must i the delicate issue regarding the proposal for early retirement address
we want on this and another issues first took to before we the budget final approve
my group is not against the idea the early retirement a compulsory nature to give
we think however that the existing proposal as vague is that the possibly more evil than good does we have already what reassuring signals from official circles take
we give the commission however like the opportunity the content the its proposal as many possible to clarifying
we hope during the next trialogue the many points good news to know under other the this point we hope also that the reserve in the category for new posts will be withdrawn
that will doubt thousand are for the good like the this parliament to this reform together with the commission from to to
mr the president first like i all four the rapporteurs thank for their good work
the improve the the european administration is a the the most reforms the the current parliament must changes
the objective the the reform the the commission must are the reduce the the bureaucracy the increase the the effectiveness and the state the financial irregularities
that requires a simplification the the working the transfer the powers to a lower level and the clarifying the the decisionmaking
the key to the reform is the increase and emphasise the the individual responsibility
the directors the the institutions must both legal if financial responsibility for the decisions to
the emphasise the the individual responsibility requires under other a rapid revision the the regulations
reform requires a the activities based budget
the directors the units and institutions must a certain manoeuvre in the financial management have
the most attention must take to the reached results and not to the working
only as can the available resources more be allocated
the institutions and their directors must clear the possibility have to the best possible management
the to the responsibility requires that the that renounce that the financing ex controlled the
if there more than one  is bears no clear responsibility
the reform the the financial management is especially need the improvement the the european transactions
the the pay the the european accounts must the same practice commissions if in the world outside the european union
the current late the three months is to long to still but to silent the the fact that many payments more than a year the the let wait
that is scandalous if the involved that the european union itself a supporter is the the modernisation the the business
my group supports the i the reform the the financial management
mr the president also my group the greens and regionalists support the reforms the the commission as described in the paper and we favour for a rapid transposition that
today during the debate on nice have we the again heard the eu the for large challenges the enlargement to plus x countries will the european institutions the the test to
same has the regard the the european institutions the the population a reached achieved one by a lack the confidence hand under pressure the increasing problems as the crisis the climate and the bse to the most topical problems but just to mention
the institutions must urgent be reformed to the confidence to restore and us better in the to to to act
we must legitimacy build by our efficiency to increase by  budgeting a culture the responsibility more transparency a administration that closer the the citizens the and decentralisation
this objectives the the commission the has the can we only but support
we fear however that the the a number points the courage there
late i if example the transparency mention
here has the commission the its appointment large promises done
the reality see there unfortunately otherwise from this that from the framework with the parliament and from the rules on the access to information
the this area see we that there still behind is and we hope the more courage to transparency the the commission
also the the area the the disciplinary are there commitments done but still always are there not clear rules and is there not clarify on the application the this rules further is the issue the the  still always not final clarify
we hope the a early statement
the regard the the whistleblowers would i i want with the what the mr the van already has said
also the this point had we the the on the the commission hoped the more courage to openness and more courage to with this issue to to to the whistleblowers have there because also to contributed that to reforms was have
the the area the the implementation the the budget must the commission but also the parliament agreed give how we in the future the problem the the  tackle further must we ensure ensure that the the implementation the new programme programmes also last the issue the the  the tackled so we not always as such large gap have between what we show and what we achieve
with the to the staff had we the group the free european alliance like given that the parliament the commission what more meet was has
we are the opinion that the recruitment the staff even very  shortcomings because with the view the the tasks in the framework the the enlargement to the east will certainly still more staff must be attracted
but as said there the this level unfortunately the support the the parliament
than must the parliament also the hand in own house to
the model find we already with already good and we hope that the commission a long breath and still more courage the the transposition will have
mr the president despite the support the the rapporteurs for the work the the commission remains still still the point that the the recommendations the the committee the independent experts not broad coherent response is has which the policy central the and not only a improve management the the institution
we take there note the that the commission has committed in stages a new  in to to but we want like know when that process completed will are
i like there only the point that the the current  according the experts a large part the the subsidies in fact calls contracts are the commission refuses they if such to deal because transparency the subsidies still less guaranteed is than the contracts
i like not consider the the  but the remains incomprehensible why the procedures secret are
what us the is the only possible reform the proposal the the socialist group in the three amendments the the report that report have we during the previous partsession discussed
to finally like i the comitology mention
the committee the experts had written that the committees the representatives from the member in the practice the vehicle for the national interests the the implementation the community policy risk to be that is sometimes as far that in the committees the winner the the community expenditure the divided
the commission like the this point not see not hear and if they clearly than is the 
according us is there a clear unlike between the  ambitions on the reform the the commission and the results
mr the president in are letter the the romans calls the apostle paul are  the the to let reform by renewal the their think
this reform is need to god sincerely to must and can not by rules be single
already is the reform the the commission not to compare with what paul order this biblical principle contains a important lesson for the commission rules can not genuine approach enforceable
commissioner kinnock trying with a change and improvement the the rules the responsibility the the officials the the commission to strengthen
how good the intention the the rules also is the is end to the implementation the this rules
the new rules must therefore where be the feasibility
the reform is the express to a amendment the attitude and behaviour the the commission and its officials
the amended preference would the must express in public the administration
the that area lacks the still still the the reform
the proposed  for financial irregularities undermining not only the openness but also the work the olaf
with a limited budget must the commission choices make in its tasks
we must choose between deepening or enlargement the the union
the next years are in the sign the the enlargement
the is therefore astonishing that the rapporteurs mr and pomés ruiz this fully cannot and the reform only see if means to european political europe
i believe that the reform the the commission in the light the the enlargement must to are and the this must up
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the reform the the commission would a next step are the way to new european institutions new in the sense that the old institutions adapted are because the problems in the past and to the the the long detailed and often complex report the the independent experts
just if the all other changes the consolidated situations must we course precise and exactly to work to
who the responsibility for legislation has can and must the not let lead by emotions and must not proposals in  adopt the not representative are the what source they also from are
experts are if such technicians but the legislator can or site or the are turn expert are he must listen opinion questions  and than a own initiative present otherwise can he better not political companies and the legislation the experts leave
let we not forget that a part the the reform that last year september was adopted already by the court the justice is rejected the reform adopt was quite unwise also already was they line with the proposal the the experts
the commission fundamental institution in the current model the the union the with its whole structure the policy the the european union from as that by the parliament and the council the the
the parliament must the succeed the commission to reform without the to let influence the replaces parts must efficient and transparent are and the staff must the aware be the itself who they are what they do and for who they work
according i there there the the world not important organisation than the eu fifteen countries soon twenty or more a very continent
the the commission and the parliament must  officials work the the of aware are and adequate paid be operational but with all guarantees and privileges the the their function hear responsible but not exposed the humiliation
if the officials recognition to for their high level and hard work will that a positive impact have the the institutions if whole
as not than pockets we again way and to who know the problems from the past again back same problems the the the were for this reform
mr the president i like like start with the express the my appreciation for the mr harbour and the work that he in are report has into
just if the mr the van i i with particularly admiration for are way the work and for the way which he prepared is has to right to do the the ideas and positions the other groups
i like also like the commission and its staff thank for their support and aid
the  is fact only the broad framework the beef
there must therefore still many done the parliament can still not the are laurels to rest
we have already heard that the commission earlier today a number documents has presented on individual aspects the the report
i i understand that the parliament this not officially in are considerations will involve
that is not good matter
what there namely with the staffing within the commission happening will end always a struggle have the the parliament that must we not forget
i would like in want to the a few the the approximately amendments the the 
as you perhaps already had expect support we the amendments to and with as tabled by the group the the european social
we will amendment however withdraw and to a vote in parts questions on the last part the amendment we are namely the opinion that the current system within the ecb the not whether for this situation
we want questions to the amendments and if additions to as since the more would are to in paragraph the involvement the the staff the the up the  and the emphasis the the human  the the  to delete
the seems that if amendment a addition later is we are there although not against but the must not if replace for the current paragraph must
we support the amendments and as tabled by the group the the european party
we are against the other amendments because the or nothing add the the report or only to  lead
i would like still just quickly a few comments make the the term change
change is never easy
many people have effort with change because they afraid are for the unknown
if someone the itself has work within a organisation where was reduced without any consultation with the existing staff like i here say that i the staff the the commission funds
if someone the itself has work within a other organisation where also a reductions has place which i unnecessary am become like i here say that i more than magnets am the the staff the the commission the way which they should work and how the commissioner with them together
the is not easy to you jobs say to are
i wanted that i itself also the opportunity been had the training for a other jobs within the organisation
mr the president i like start with the congratulate the the mr harbour
i remind i what he said on the long  the are work and i would the commission than also with urge want questions or they the timetable not if at want as
there is a time there been the a vacuum and i think that the commission the more would must achieve that the  about important is for us here in this parliament and still important for the european citizens
i would now like your attention want questions for what the mr  in are explanatory divided has the on the institutional role the the commission and with particularly on the 
i am the not often agree with my gentlemen mr the mr the dam the together with i session has in the delegation for estonia
he said however two things the i endorse namely the first that there a amended preference need is and the second that the enlargement a essential factor is for the success the the commission in the future
the mr  the with the to the enlargement that the the commission expect the that they with a broad strategy is the account the with the interests and the political agenda the the union and not only but with a believe regarding the jurisdiction the the respective candidates
when i earlier member the this parliament was was jacques delors president and working he together with commissioner leon and this with commissioner cockfields
this people were not wait to they ideas presented were the the council
they because itself the programme for the internal market and worked the closely together with the parliament
they to their shoulders under the programme and they belonging the also
there was there the a large extent the about the and harmony between the institutions
i would commissioner kinnock simply the message want give although i that convinced am that he the not really need has to the not only to concentrate the management and technical fulfil but with particularly the emphasis to to the the staff the the believe in the own activities and the the conviction that the parliament with the commission like work we must a objective have
that objective is enlargement and that is very difficult to achieve
we questions the commission to the if driving force to act if that happening can they the our support count
mr the president any administration must regular be review adapted and modernisation
our group supports therefore the in the paper included proposals the commissioner kinnock has developed
this proposals be in the report the the mr harbour positive assessed and we support the report the the mr harbour that by the commission legal affairs and internal market is approved
despite is the socialist group the opinion that the community administrative now already properly effective working
we must not forget that the crisis within the commission not by a or other shortcoming in the administration is the but by political problems the little with the function the the administration to make had the would than also unfair are the crisis within the commission the a bad force the the official apparatus to to write
we must think that the administration the the community the certain principles based the in the public administration the the european mainland general accepted are example the principle that officials a career follow and a sustainable the have
the principles are introduced after a period which holders their stock  by jobs to distribute and by things winner to make or to tension
the system the a stable them nothing other the guarantee that political changes not influence would have the the public administration
in a country if spain where we political movers times have seen was the apparatchiks least offer for stability
therefore recognise we although that the administration must be modernisation but is the our main concern that this fundamental principles the the community administration guaranteed continue the community administrative there currently from very occasionally officials the the often large personal sacrifices make to to brussels to move and therefore a appropriate pay for their efforts received
we to that from that the commission specific proposals will continue do we think that we the opportunity will to to us on from to speak and the commission meantime the the further development the its administrative tasks to help
we think however also that two fundamental principles must be respected in the first place must the by officials acquired rights be respect
in the second place must also the principle the the security and stability the their the be respected officials must also the right have the the a trade the to the and their position career and even their professional reputation to defend
with this recital want we the commission and the mr kinnock encourage their relatively continue to to
mr the president gentlemen commissioners gentlemen colleagues we who rightly high expectations the regard the this reform
the is unfortunately that they the the is the by the resignation the the commission in march the result the fraudulent practices and bad management
the citizens have their confidence in the european institutions lost and the will difficult are to that back to win
the is clear that the commission effort has to its programmes from to to
the arrears payments have the 
everyone know where the problem  the commission was inundated with new tasks the procedures were increasingly more and names still more time in up and the structures methods and formal aspects were not adapted the the new circumstances
the result is us all know the has the the commissioners and their respective services very what dedication and ability taken
the commission must urgent the use the the existing human resources optimise and new staff appointed
that only enough however not to a better implementation the the actions and the available resources to guarantee
there is also need the a indepth reform the the structures and working and the distribution the the powers under the parliament the council and the commission must clear be defined
the first two institutions must the policy up priorities the and financial resources kind while the commission the the necessary conditions must meet to the good financial management the the community programmes to guarantee
what the last aspect the is the the essential important that the executive competence the the commission the strengthened
to must the comitology be reformed i will the explain if the commission the budget under article the the treaty under own responsibility effect the the effective management the this institution the links the by certain actions the the member the through committees the management and regulatory committees their own national interests try to defend
therefore is also the  urgent the change to
in the conviction that this reform a where success will be congratulate i the four rapporteurs with particularly mrs  mr whose work i the close i followed
mr the president the resignation the the commission in the spring the was in fact the  the a many more else problem the the european commission not clear defined systems the budget in a lack the political responsibility fragmented priorities and not results
the paper the commissioner kinnock is a answer the this problems but is same many further because the reform are based the principles the a modern european public service
in a such service hear our citizens central to are and citizens expect the their on simply results and adequate action when their interests in the affected are
affairs if bse oil greenhouse have a expressed european component
the commission has here therefore a important task to role
results for the citizens can only be success when the commission in the is quickly to act transparent to act both under other the this public service responsibility the to to
this must therefore the objective the the reforms within the commission are
we have all can see how the culture the fear the decisionmaking within the commission than i i the also on the services and the officials reasonable has paralysed total has paralysed must i the say
as is the area the the external relations exemplary for the large problems which the commission unfortunately still still question
many thousands  wait already more than a year the a assessment
letters and ask to information on the the the affairs be not or concerned dealt
this type situation have the confidence the the involved citizens and organisations been the
in this light deserves the by commissioner kinnock proposed change to effectiveness and sent management and budget all support
the commission can the the the its core up and its efficiency strong increase
same can the package the reform the culture the fear break so the official organisation again confidence the in its own can because this are very many good people
the european parliament can then the commission those the the by its achieved results which the political priorities as down by parliament and council but time also actually the focus the services the the citizens the most  forms
the is essential that the credibility the the european public service in the view the the public quickly the layoffs
this can not be achieved by a to large focus the the floor internal in the reforms
the public must also the feeling have that the commission actually accessible and transparent is
the recently presented paper the the european administration contains to many good encourage but the other areas must still many be won
i think the the public the documents for citizens where we the still not satisfied on are
now must we the chapter on fraud bureaucracy and the fall the the commission final the
let we a new book open on a modern european public service the are constitutional role to properly favour ready is for next enlargement and to finally the services the the european public if its new mission advance 
commissioner kinnock and president prodi to the the socialist group the full support that means also that we the full continue ensure the the results and the criteria the in the paper as beautiful are defined
mr the president gentlemen commissioners gentlemen colleagues i will the very briefly the and like first already the rapporteurs thank
the is a good and hope matter that they the basis the consensus have work
as we have noticed is this debate not much on the principles the objectives or the desirability the the reform but on procedures the pace and the timetable and possible shortcomings or undesirable consequences the this reform
the is however a necessary reform since this not the usual selfcritical the basis is the the a given at within any administration the exercised when the already few decades there but a genuine political crisis
there the us however not political reform with administrative consequences to wait but a administrative reform with political consequences
we are therefore for a challenge which politicians the but rarely the see we must if political responsible the best way find to the governability the the institutions to assure and same the citizens a good administration to offer
a successful reform is a shared success we to all many the the stake to this leap forward to can make
the seems i therefore not only appropriate but even necessary that we all opportunities the the interinstitutional consultation use
that consultation must to to lead that the main legislation on the community finance through the codecision process
also must there in the framework the the financial perspectives  on the budget be closed
finally must the consultation to lead that we the reform joint to hand and control
gentlemen colleagues i think that the citizens the  important find than the stake they are earlier interested in the objectives and the consequences the the reform than in the way which the the carried
the citizens will the ask how transparent we to work to or we in our decisionmaking account with them the or we a coherent labour have agreed and how effective we end work the the basis will they us assess
and i i agree consideration on a the the very justified comments the the mr the van earlier was and tried a statement to find why the parliament and also i the pleased had to to a extended debate on external relations earlier today to should listen
i would the mr the van that want point that there a simple statement is for the difference in duration between the two debates and their place the the agenda
for the european parliament forms the external relations a live interesting matter given my lifelong personal interest the that level am i the the fully agree
that seems i a good statement for the european parliament is the reform a important issue which the parliament if budgetary and legislative body decisive influence can exercise
this declared why in the political for external relations if first subject the the agenda two at the allocated while the reform only the the second place is and this only one at the the spent
how more influence you the a subject you how later in the evening the the the item the the
mr the president i am you very grateful for the opportunity in this debate to should respond the the excellent work that by the four rapporteurs the the parliament the four musketeers is done with the to the paper on the reform the the commission
the is because my task to a topical picture to give the the last developments in the implementation the our strategy to a modernisation to the to to and preparations to take for the supplementary improvements the we in the framework the our strategy eight months ago have explained
the does i also many pleased to to see that my gentlemen mr michaele schreyer the the us has our they will course like the the parts the the reports the specific the the with its 
i would like want start with the parliament that to parts that in the sitting the the college the commissioners morning which the mr the van already referred a proposal is adopted for the into the a interinstitutional agreement the up the a committee for good in the public administration a and another as explained in action the the action from the paper
the college has decided to a provisional strategy the must lead to a decentralisation and simplification the the decisionmaking something that end will lead to a considerable improvement the the productivity within the commission and to a reduction the the bureaucracy the the areas which everyone as rightly comment has
the college the commissioners has today also agreement achieved on important proposals in the with the reform the the policy
the documents on this policy to on disciplinary whistleblowing and equal treatment
they will the formal basis forms the the legal down consultation between the commission its staff and the  that course in the next months will place
our proposals the regard the the disciplinary up the the a number necessary changes as a improvement and restructuring the the  the disciplinary a such research must moreover the by a  to be carried
this proposals mean that the disciplinary to a permanent and more professional body must funds the the chaired by a qualified expert the outside the commission that there better provisions must to the apply the justified  the officials including officials the criminal persecuted be for a national judge that the essential coordination between the commission and olaf must be consolidated without the the as necessary independence the olaf the to really that the list the possible sanctions further developed must be so this better is between the proven offences the the regulations
already this proposals are that at to the commission and the other european institutions also the parliament in the to to the professionalism the  and the reasonable progress the disciplinary to improve without that this the expense is the the  and the rights the the suspicious
in the document on the whistleblowing the proposed a system to introduce that with the the best existing practices in the member
proposed the to the notification from the existing regulation to into in the text the the regulations
the proposal describes the rights the whistleblowers have the protection the their career if they real irregularities the responsible way report
the contains guarantee against the loose or  report the abuses
the emphasis the the the the responsibility the those the any the possible irregularities have received to immediately vigorously and effective the to act
there be also many the clear procedures described for various alternatives for the report the irregularities within and outside the institution where the on official working
addition the right to abuses to report the olaf and the are or its several within the institution has a official also the right to suspicions and proof for to to the the presidents the the council and this parliament the the commission the the court or the the ombudsman
the create the external  is the most and most progressive change i am that convinced that the change in the benefit the the institutions and their staff the the european union and course also the the public important will work
to finally be in us document on equal opportunities specific put described to to ensure that there the the market there is the equal opportunities so effective can be responded the the were inequalities in the treatment the women ethnic minorities and disabled in the past the must course the merit the workers not ignored be
in this documents have we again following sought the the best practices in the member
to time to save and right to do the the  within the commission hope i that the parliament i allow to the  details from the very so and constructive report the mrs mr behalf the committee and the issues the the area the the financial management the in the just productive report the the mr pomés ruiz are highlighted on to let the my gentlemen mr commissioner schreyer
if there more time available was would i course like the the opportunity use have made to the the the item set issues to discuss but i am there certainly the that the opportunity the still the for will do
i like i the this at however to to a the the issues the by the mr pomés ruiz is touched moreover also by other gentlemen members namely the question why the commission not has responded the the proposal that in a number reports the the commission control is done to a separate chamber for the budgetary in the life to to or if part the the court or within the court the justice
i believe that the mr the van in the during the the debate again the this issue has out
the is a good question there are in principle two reasons to proposals the to point which the commission the to such external institutions would can use
in the first place has the committee the independent experts wants to my opinion rightly that a such institution a internal body would must are that is certainly not in the last place because the treaties in the with the control the the financial implications and the legitimacy the the disciplinary decisions the the commission a very specific role has allocated the the other two institutions
there would a untenable  place and the would the constitutional if the were in manages must improvement if the court or the court the justice directly involved would be the the internal decisionmaking the the commission
also would such changes only place can find if also the treaties accordingly would be adapted
in the second place would the split the a disciplinary matter in the financial aspects and the other  practical given lead to the undesirable fact that the disciplinary considerably the extended if the matter the different institutions presented must be
i hope that this parliament also the opinion is that this reasons legitimate are as the document on disciplinary morning fact already has demonstrated
in the most member and in all international organisations is the institution itself responsible for the the responsibility to the its staff
we are clear the opinion that this also in all institutions the the european union the case must continue
if we now look to the parts from the reports the the gentlemen  and harbour on management and staff must i with large sorry the that the time i not allow to now the attention the the issues to to the the reports certainly deserve
i i however to here the to see that i with both reports very welcome am
i thank the mr harbour for the very positive and reasonable way which he and are commission the complex aspects the the modernisation the the policy within the commission and the other european institutions have viewed
the report has us additional very sensible subjective presented for further discussions the many relevant areas also are in the by the mr harbour organised public hearing on the policy practices and knowledge from the private and public sector to the has the very enlightening were
i would also my thank want express for the constructive knowledge and comments the by the mr  to the are the on the constitutional framework which the the current reform happening
he asking rightly attention for the broad whole and the that the very valuable would are been if the achieve paper on management ex was has by proposals for a administrative reform
ideal given has he course right
i know however that he and other gentlemen members the also achieve that the political priority and urgency the necessarily the the agenda is given to has led that delays in the reform not possible and acceptable would are been
i am there however the convinced that the analysis and the principles the next year in the commission on management divided be the us on direct information will provide than is namely also the at time to the stage the to the and to start with the fully implementation the the reform and the modernisation the for the subsequent two years are for
i like all gentlemen members thank for the large considered efforts the they in the last months have made the the area the the reform
i thank them also for the quality the the other contribute the they in the during the the debate evening have made i am course very pleased that i with right can say that the hope the i last year i expressed that the commission and the parliament closely would work the the reform absolutely not demand hope is has
also this thank i this parliament as for the congratulates patience evening
thank you the mr kinnock
i am that convinced that the parliament you still the a opportunity will give here further the in to to unless this reform tomorrow the the first vote 
we will therefore in the future the still the pleased tastes you here to hear speak
i give the floor the mrs schreyer to the report the the commission the to conclude
mr the president gentlemen members the reform the the commission is a fundamental reform
that that from the paper and i believe that this also clear that from the reports the the parliament
the both the the reform is the improvement the the financial management
the is not to adjustments the details contrary especially the this area is the to extensive and substantial changes
the best news is that important parts the the reform already are into
this are not only the paper but are already reality become
other parts situation still in the stage and again other must also by the parliament and the council supported and into be
i like like the important points the the reports the mrs mr and the mr pomés ruiz the specific the budgetary the up the the budget and the implementation the the budget deal
both issue programmes be dealt in the new 
this new  is the core the the reform
the most objectives that are simplification a greater transparency and the strengthening the the  specific means this less derogations less incomprehensible special regulations and a greater efficiency and efficiency the the budgetary
new is that regulations as the for the contractors the tasks and financial assistance the the budget be increased
the regulations for the daily  be more and they be better can we hope and that is us objective that this the number irregularities in the future will reduce
mrs mr your report is in the many points the the new  but you the also demonstrated the your concern that information for the parliament lost would can to by the budgeting budgeting activitybased
i believe that i this concern can refute
the suited the budgeting budgeting activitybased is because that from the budget clear that how money for what policy the available the both for operational if for the necessary administration
we want say what the costs the a the policy are and you has right that that still not same is if a  but the the the a conclusion overview the the resources the for a policy available are and that is a liking for the budget the the european union
the result of is that the area the the budget as the to still to was the area in a part for administrative expenditure and a part for operational the abolished this means not that the costs for administration and staff not more recognisable are and not more individual be increased
this be course the a specific line increased but they be together the the relevant policy so they not more anonymously disappear in the general budget for the administration the the commission
this  approach has to objective the resources better in agreement to to with the political priorities
the is a instrument to the costs better to can windows and visible to make the is a husbanded to the management better accordance the priorities to can send
the was also a important wish the the parliament to the political priorities better visible to make
again us objective is transparency and i believe that we this objective achieve
late i you briefly say mr   the categories the the financial perspectives continue there
this forms a instrument for the financial planning and this the we the the
further i i with large pleased the mrs mr that you a  you i doubt there not the that you not only with knowledge the affairs but also with advanced the the debate in the parliament on the new  will participate
i like like the a point where the mr pomés ruiz in are report strong the emphasis the the namely the issue the the payment
you has right that you this as strong stressed
last year could only two third the the payments within the term the days be met and i part your criticism that that unacceptable is
now is the case that the number financial transactions strong is has but that is not excuse
the must also for the commission course are that payments within the term be met and that has the commission the the objective the
a number the the steps to this to achieve like i here mention
under other be the regulations in the contracts with the to the mission simplified and the commission will more use make the the instrument the the aid compensation
the is for the commission than also but economic responsible when the contracts the costs x be replace by the costs y by and that than often the  the minimum sums be gathered and controlled
here is the instrument the the aid compensation also economic extremely useful
further is the the important that the the commission clear the down when a account most
this will we a central register schemes which the  accounts be included and we will a claim the payment the interest the to late payment in the budget and in the contracts set
this is course always a extremely close and hard financial instrument
with the to the  like i briefly mention that the commission this a legal will present
moreover is the commission in its note the amendment length in the the issue the the bat programmes the offices for technical assistance i am welcome that the ideas the the commission and the the parliament strong part on how we here in the future that must deal
the administrative reform must the work the the commission improve
this have we good staff need and we have sufficient staff need
therefore like the commission for next year more staff attract for the directorategeneral budget i am very pleased on the decisions the previous week in the framework the the conciliation are taken
with the current reform preparing the commission the for the a better procedures the its current but also the new future tasks in the framework the the enlargement
we will us course all make to the reforms as quickly possible to to to
sometimes the the criticism expressed that all affairs still not are implemented but the forget sometimes that we in a democratic system life and that there fortunately but  apply
the reform must also by the staff the the commission be supported
the reform must be accepted and supported also by the other institutions not in the last place by the elected representatives
i like the parliament the i thank for are both critical if  support
obviously are we still the time with the reform started because the is still not five for twelve
thank you the mrs the commissioner
the joint debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
relations 
the the item is the report a the mrs sauquillo pérez del arco behalf the commission development on the effectiveness the the relations between the eu and the developing and the consequences the the reform the the commission for this relations ini
mr the president gentlemen colleagues first like i like the quality stress the the report the mrs  on the reform the the commission and the impact of the the effectiveness the the relations the the european union with the developing
one the the large merit the this report is that the clear to the going that the european union and its member without more a adult development must to because that only is in agreement with the culture and the view the us continent
i like like first just briefly the figures repeat to what embarrassed than also with the current actions to avoid
we can not often enough repeat that the european union with its member more than the half the the  the developing the and the in unlike to a common prejudice the the european union still greater obligations the the what the the european aid in apart sense
the share the the union in the global aid was thirty year ago and is now
the total aid the countries outside the union is increased the billion euro in therefore ten year ago to billion date the today
that is course not but is not reason to a  possible the our  development
that the not way that we account must the with a reality where we not choice can
this objective i the the development that a number the the member the addition the european policy
to my opinion can we therefore on the whole acrosstheboard a improvement achieve by a pragmatic procedure the must there from a as good possible harmonisation the the actions the the member and the the the community
i think that they other the will make
that is moreover also the trend the the important statement on the regional policy the the council and the commission the november on
this the a labour between the commission and the member introduced from the view the the benefits the each the both has
to my opinion must we careful for two pitfalls the both just dangerous are one a gradual renationalisation the the development hand a  to to the european commission the monopoly the the development to give
nevertheless is the reform the the european commission in the good direction because they both proposals does to its own action more to make and a greater responsibility up the the beneficiaries the the development
that brings us course the the problem the the human the speakers have the there already on had the to now to not is
i will here not longer the on are
the conclude mr the president like i you like with emphasis point the three amendments the i i tabled behalf the group namely the amendments and which the philosophy is the the european union a active and not passive player to make in the development a player the the being to the allocated financial resources better the to use
the group will for the report the mrs sauquillo vote we hope that the changes the in the report be proposed in eight be taken
president a the the five people in the world has not access to social basic
europe is economic a power and therefore is the very rightly that we in following the the debate on the paper now also discuss
the is a very good initiative the mrs sauquillo to also the part foreign relations to involve the the internal training and the also the the agenda to to
we are with large problems
the commissioner has the also in are documents noted large behind lack the objectives a culture the fear in the services for expenditure and same many to low level the projects many lost time and little effective spending
we want to to more responsibility
we want to to  control
we want to more responsibility for the public service we want to deconcentration
we want to a european development that integrated is the the parliament
we want to clear objectives
the parliament has that everything for if the is to are role in the  for
this to we still the back because that is the itself a good framework
we have large hesitation the the whole technical form which now the reforms report be
for us is the important that we a clear political distribution have a parliament with clear objectives a commission the clear know what they like a commissioner i support the mrs sauquillo the full the  responsibility has for very the world if the is to development and the also the full responsibility the within the commission and this than also human spa the the because without this human spa is the course completely impossible to this policy from to to
than would i briefly want summarise let we a end make the the culture the fear also the the officials
let we the confidence build between us parliament the services and the commissioner so europe something can present in a world the poverty where we with a other message to
 was know if the chant the not words but action
late the commissioner also that logo to the his make
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i i fully behind the report the mrs sauquillo to its commitment and to the contribution the the commission development the the reform
if the reform will lead to a greater involvement the the european parliament as in the explanatory the hoped must there policy be developed that not only but on funds and  is but that specific aid offers the the developing
aid offer means not only money out but also others distance to aid to the difficult moments or when they there the own force not it
poverty and lack are not only the result the economic behind and development but also often the aggression and exploitation the weakest by  the selfseeking cannot the weakest and quality
before we decide on support the projects must we try all causes the the current exploitation way to take by from to seek who there benefit has the the exploitation and the abuse the peoples the in welloff circumstances situation and this responsible to prosecute
the replaces commission must before they subsidy much a research up to the causes the have contributed the the the the the situation which the poor peoples the are
there the often talk on the debt the the debt the the developing
the expression suggests that the to a act the  or generosity is but almost is the perhaps not more than a act the justice
the commission must there also the ensure that that the international level happening
the the way will the living improve and will the gap reduce between the poor the still poorer be and the increasing the of benefit and still increasing be
mr the president i am today returned from mozambique where the european union responsible is been for  humanitarian aid after the dam the reconstruction where we the financial resources already for granted have have however again delay behind because waited the the signatures from brussels
greater emphasis the programming to to controls ex postal and streamlined   yes
evening late if we a clear even hard position in must take and if my much mr mrs sauquillo pérez del arco its resort has sought to a report to there certainly the to are that the parliament the aware is the are accountability must the commission good listen if the european parliament no says
in the first place will the dismantling the the dg development a  the the external support that not reform
we want one only directorate for development that the responsibility has for policy and implementation for trade and development for asia africa and latin america the commission other like the other policies look to and the a hybrid solution for which the programming separately will place
in the second place demands we that there a end is the the increasing cuts the the external aid the developing the favour the countries in the border the the eu this is with particularly the last years happened
in the  the may the not few time the floor poverty same applies for the resolution the the council general affairs the october
we must ensure ensure that the eu the the the the promises during the  that development the highest priority has that means that we the guarantee must give that a the percentage the the external support to the least developed countries in the world is
to finally must we us aware achieve that the proposal the the mr patten to the responsibility for development under to to the a council the administration existing from commissioners under leadership the the mr nielson only a  divert is this is borrowing from a  and is fundamental incompatible with the collegiate structure the the commission itself
because the mr nielson as loyalty is the relation the the collegiate responsibility will he the proposal evening doubt defend
i hope than also that the other commissioners to our message will listen namely that we on a very effective commissioner for development have
let we him therefore also the political responsibility give for the implementation the are task
mr the president the last annual the the world contains figures the as  are that they for developed countries both a scandal if a challenge are
from that report that that the poverty and the underdevelopment precisely increase and that very many people still always not their inalienable right the a dignified life can exercise
also there the fear that the problems the poor countries by the globalisation the the economy will increase which the gap the them the the rich countries and still cause the
this facts can only mean that we the fight against the poverty and the underdevelopment with more involvement and a greater effectiveness must to
to ensure to ensure that the solidarity the the european union as many possible will and we the poverty and the causes of fully can eradicate must we the action the the union and the guidance the its development reconsider order the effectiveness the our efforts to increase
the excellent report the mrs sauquillo which i its like congratulate and the the laid proposals to than also exactly the the good at they point the way the the european union must follow to the challenges the the st century the the area the the development the head to offer
there the proposed the delegations more powers to give the staff for development from to extend and the allocation the the financial resources with the objectives the the community development in agreement to to other proposals concern the simplification the the administrative procedures and course the additional nature and the cohesion between the community and the national development
let we hope that the commission and the council for this proposals open and that we together the final eradication the the poverty more closer can to to as the the creation the a fairer world the to to
the european commission has the the preparation the its reform failed those to consult the the in the parliament with development deal
therefore has the commission development decided the own initiative the report for to to that we now deal
we defend the the statement that the to the a development order the world fairer balanced and stable to make not  is but precisely to the priorities the the european union must properly also find we that our efforts to that objective to achieve if a essential part the our own political agenda must be as
we draw in the report the mrs sauquillo also the attention the few by the commission proposed reforms the we wrong find
as would according the proposed  the development by a service be formulated while a other service for the implementation responsible is
our commission is the with the rapporteur agree that the commissioner the settingup the development both must formulate if must out he must this however the coordinate with other policies the the external relations concern
we find the still more that the commission in its proposal the territorial distribution use
we find the not reasonable that the  the almost only with the acp concerns while the relations with asia latin america and the mediterranean which development however a important role plays in hands continue the those the the external relations maintain
and mr the president this debate take the the good at place because the commission in fact important and new steps has taken with the to the reform the the external relations
the commission has today decided a new bureau the to up that responsible is for the european cooperation from the identification the the activities to the the implementation that
the process the the implementation the the decision the the commission the may on the reform the the external relations process good
the the reform play three important elements a role the improvement the the  the out the the management the the programming and the transfer the powers the the delegations
what the programmes for each country the has the commission a  adopted that for the papers for each country will apply
this is recently discussed during the council the ministers the development and all member were here positive the
we have now on a harmonised framework for the up the papers for each country and for programmes in all developing
this is the country itself central to are in the process also have we now a basis for a reinforced cooperation with member and other donors the the that country involved are
this is the instrument that we already many years inject miss in the discussion on the question how we a better coordination can achieve
the two most elements the the improvement the the effects the our cooperation in the future are a clear protection the poverty if part the the thorough revision the the framework and a emphasis the a limited number sectors
under presidency the the dg development is the want group for the improvement the the quality with are work started
this group will ensure ensure that the papers developed be within the agreed framework and the agreed methodology i i there all confidence in that this group for more quality and consistency in our so will ensure
the activities the the group serve the from on the whole world and will a large improvement that with the to the consistency the the policy that we support
if last and that is certainly not the least important point will i together with my incoming for external relations very soon legislative the the college submit to the rules to change with the to the legal for all instruments and lines the the area the the external relations
this to the committees the possibility to their activities the strategies to concentrate in place the the individual projects
what the out the the management the the programming the is there today within the commission formally agreement achieved on the up the the new bureau
the bureau will responsible are for the management the all steps the the programming
from beginning next year will officials the the dg development and the dg foreign relations staff be to the new bureau the staffing the the bureau will then gradually further extended be with agents the  while the dismantling the the offices for technical assistance parallel this place will find
also the this level are the developments thanks the support and the understanding the the budgetary very making has
to finally is there a programme up to powers on to to the the 
within three year will approximately delegations and officials see that their working considerably are improve
addition comprehensive financial powers to they also the available on better computer and 
also the the financing the this important reform the the european external relations has the cooperation the the budgetary a essential role played
in will the financial powers example decentralised and divided are on delegations the fifteen other delegations will there a  the the  place and there will forty additional  be allocated the the external services
the  in was the first step the way to a more implementation the eight programmes
the was clear that this reform only not effect would effects this is now everyone the on agree despite has the reform actually the the basis the for a number changes the we now the the changes are
the is essential that we the procedures simplify if we things in a more pace want out
the is also necessary that we ensure ensure that our programmes in the future easy managed can be by our delegations and that the programmes also more be for our partners
would the namely with different giveaway possible are to on transparency to talk
would we otherwise the a  can expect that he the morocco to mauritania or the botswana to south consequent if the procedures for each programme and the relevant financial nuclearrelated all different would are and time again again  must be
the is therefore without more necessary to simplifications the to to
in the resolution be the unclear and divided responsibilities within the whole the the  and the this runs complicated the are in rightly regarded if areas
also has the  not solution the for the continuing bad harmonisation between the eight extensive administrative structures
in the resolution the the one area a reform done that further is than what today by the commission is adopted
the proposal is namely not only from the a out the the programming but the the whole  including the programming which the dgs development and foreign relations responsible continue
the that point can i only but say that the reform a dynamic process is
through the group for the improvement the the quality will a deliberate and better controlled transfer the the  the the bureau possible be
to this flexible to let has to we the this issue properly many attention
i would the parliament there also the want remind that the decision also a  contains
we will the force the this new system must evaluate and where need steps must take to more and thoroughly reforms by to to
the commission is the very good aware the the important the the support the the parliament for the reform the its policy and working
i am than also very welcome with the support proposals in the report the mrs sauquillo and for the very positive contribute during the debate the evening
i give you the insurance that i my best will do to the parliament the the informed to the the the put also support i the request the the commission to regular the this parliament report from to to on the reform the the external services
i like you sincerely thank for your contribution mr the commissioner

mrs the president gentlemen members mrs the commissioner i importance there particularly many important the today in the european parliament present to are the this debate on the first package measures the the area the the sea you deals today because three important reports the the first crucial stage mean the a subject that by the recent events unfortunately very topical become is
the european union has kilometres  the to the  the world one
the important the this  for the shipping is clearly but this brings same a large responsibility with the that
since the accident with the erika in december last year is within our european institutions hard work the a solution
the first package measures the this area that in march is proposed by the commission is dealt by the parliament and by the council
the next days the a second package expect
the european council the biarritz has the into on this issue the also the the summit the nice still a important role will play
the any disaster make our european citizens the evil on the insecurity the sea and the risk programmes the they are if result the the decades ships the pollutants or dangerous substances transport and daily the our coastlines see
i am the opinion that we understanding must have for their emotions and their anger
course want we here something the do
how would we can allow that the transport that the as crucial important is for trade and movement the development the expense the the safety the human and environment
how would we can allow that ships which the number and the important still growing and the in increasing extent are how our coastal  without to all time the strict legislation the the area the safety  and social affairs after to life as that the the transport on country and by the air the happening
we can not longer allow that the to to the lowest prices within the  to standard the become
also can and should we not longer allow that certain states cheap sometimes for but a few dollar very old and rusty ships under their flag let see that shipowners sometimes information and  crew in service have that classification the sometimes not as closely take with the quality the ships and with their crew to not clients to lose and that  sometimes especially the costs want express
according some with particularly in france must strict national measures be taken to the french coastlines to protect some to even for to french  the to up
the erika and the   were however not french ships
the shipowner or the register the this ships were not french the erika and the   to both in international waters when they shipwreck members
although any the individual are responsibility must to take must decisions the this area in wider the with particularly the european level be taken
the is for the european parliamentarians not only a role play i know your drive the this area they are even the crucial important for a farreaching and rapid introduction the community law and legislation
the european citizens are the here very the the aware witness the current concerns on meal and the mad
in the followup will they us this corner
they will the international bodies the responsibility to and the them demands that they efficient function
because when the tomorrow the the european coastlines again a accident or shipwreck happens will our negligence what the the legislation rightly the the denounce be the
i would you gentlemen members mrs the president want say that only already the treatment the the proposals the today subject that the european parliament a efficient institution is the quickly and adequate know in to play the the concern the our citizens
i am than also pleased that thanks initiatives the the european parliament the commission and the council soon considerable progress will be made in the to to a greater safety the the european seas
the basis the the proposals the we in february on have tabled has the european commission namely the its turn with large drive proposals tabled
today deals you in first reading this three proposals
i i should the that the parliament and are rapporteurs determined are in their to to strict and effective proposals the to take to the safety the sea to guarantee
also i i should the that we in the framework the improvement the the safety the sea same objectives achieve and this even the same way want achieve
same i i together with the rapporteurs noted that the texts on the classification and the state technical perhaps still further must be developed
we can us ask or we the partsession the the parliament the december not must opportunity to also the remaining problems the to solve
the would the presidency the the council with the member discussions can to to the basis the your proposals to a agreement the the council to to and the text necessary with a qualified majority the vote in first reading the to take
we would can to to a as broad possible consensus on the way which classification responsibility must make on more rules for the against the vessels the see under the flag the a country that top the black list the on the introduction the black weigh and on the introduction the inspections for ships the the the risk forms
this text for the improvement the the safety the sea and the abolition the hulled ships only already the reason to satisfaction with the work that the parliament has done
the on the this text if you this as your rapporteur probably will advise will adopt can between now and over a third and between now and two third the the hulled  be banned
this is a considerably number and this would the possible must be to the dangerous ships the the our coastlines see the short term to replace and our safety to increase
mrs the president gentlemen members gentlemen rapporteurs now does the the opportunity for to the safety the the transport to improve
we know all that this measures which you today is debate not enough are
the state and government have out the the urgent need to a second package measures the to to with the to the monitoring the and the transparency the the transport the up the a european bureau and the responsibility the all people and operators the the deal with the transport and with dangerous or polluting products
france has in this framework also again out the the need to in community the the training and the conditions the seafarers to improve i am i that aware that a number the you this concerned is
from this everything may will that the determination the the community institutions to my view crucial is
i am that convinced that this determination very large is and here in the european parliament in brussels already results start the to throw the result must are that only safe and sound ships with trained crew with normal conditions and normal conditions should see that all the the deal with the transport the last aware be the their responsibility and that the legislation for the transport last the strengthened which account the taken with the right the the sea bordering countries the and their to to protection the their environment
mrs the president i think that no remind doubt that the commission just as the french presidency the safety the sea and the protection the the environment extremely important issues take
since the disaster with the erika as such eleven months back are this issues top the agenda the the commission
recently a few weeks back is there still a other tanker cannot the chemicals transported for the coast the france shipwreck that was the  
again were we reminded the the disastrous consequences the a such accident can have
the population the europe is not prepared to accidents with oil and other by shipping or industry caused disasters still longer to accept
the citizens has the right to to expect that ships safe are and that they their cargo the a for the environment acceptable way transport without that the the life and the means the the people the neighbouring coastal be threatened
i i the consequences the the disaster with the erika with own view given when i a visit were the the place the the accident the costs many time many work and course also many money to everything the to overcome
the shipwreck the the erika has disastrous consequences had
the will clear are that because their geographical location the always same areas are the the risk programmes the  on sea must to while the benefits the such transport the the all member the the european union the good to
we take this matter than also very seriously the commission has an quickly and consistent action that that the from the fact that they in a year time six different legislative on very different issues has dealt
all proposals are the core the the directives for the shipping i like you remind remind that addition the three proposals the here today dealt be the erika  next week the table is
that has mr  also already said in this package the measures the proposed a european bureau for safety in the shipping to forms a new european system for real compensation for victims the reign the to to and a new  for the unsustainability the established to to
this rapid and specific approach the led to the two  and six legislative has this issue a enormous impetus given
i think that we with right can say that the member and the international  only after the disaster with the erika fully are aware the the determination the the european institutions to the safety the sea to improve
they see now in that the determination not will stall even already lead such measures to friction between the eu and the international  and already are they the odds footing with the economic interests the the 
now there proposals the the commission the table are must we not wait to the next disaster the leeway but must we optimum the this new impetus to benefit
to really the to to the the safety the sea must the three institutions but in the particularly the parliament and the council the proposals adopt
legislation only is however not sufficient
the member must there also for ensure that they on the right resources have to the laws from to to the think i especially the the recruiting the inspectors for the out the superficial
if we us here not for make will our legislation not the results have the the citizens that expect
behalf the commission can i you assure that the our intention is to both next year if the year this us fully in to to for the safer make the our ships and the cleaner make the our seas
we want this objective achieve for all 
i like end with mr  president the the council to thank for are encouraging comment
the european institutions are decisive to a real change in the maritime safety bring to to we hope and expect that the december the council are contribution will make the this joint determination by common positions with the to all three the texts the to take
the commission is not the plan to costs what costs a compromise to accept
the excellent quality the their work that they within a very briefly time have done witness the their insight in the important the the first erika also wanted i the parliament thank for the on the general good cooperation between the parliament and the commission on the issue the the safety the sea
mrs the president on few days armed we the disaster with the tanker the erika now is the again a year ago that the this disaster episodes
we know all but already to good that there since many other tragic accidents the sea are happened
but we know also that the erika not the the beginning was the the series disastrous accidents because long this are there many other ships sank the this accidents lost ships not only their cargo example oil often also were there fatal victims
the parliament can here learn from draw we must conclude that on the whole world the maritime legislation in bad the state
now is the at time to something the the situation to do within the context like i than also the commission congratulate with its attempt a end to make the a number the the principle to ensure to ensure that there not still agree a erika place
my group  also the french presidency and with particularly the minister he is namely determined ensure to ensure that we really the the disaster with the erika learn so a such disaster not still agree place
if the minister and the french presidency not as decisive were been were the special committee the the imo and we the not with other agree become that hulled oil world the short term gradually must to be abolished
i like the presidency than also in the particularly with the achievement congratulate i hope that the plenary sitting the the imo here very soon its approval the will attach
the is not the lack the maritime legislation that world the the problem is but a certain unwillingness the the countries on the whole world to to to see the the compliance the the maritime legislation
i am afraid that the state the the by unwillingness the the member the the european union and the other countries to the inspection the adequate way from to to
therefore are we welcome with the amendment the the directive because we there the for can ensure that the directive on state good the observed
i i is the proposal the the commission however not far enough
the proposal is not strong enough
according my group would there with this proposal if the would be carried again a such disaster if the with the erika can place
that is the reason why we morning not in can vote with the proposal the the commission but four proposals to the to the according us the current proposal considerably strengthen the basis the our proposals can the parliament the agree with the final proposal the the commission
first are we the agreed agree that the compulsory inspections the the most dangerous ships must be extended
on are we the all agree but we must still a method see to find which this priority can be carried within the three institutions must we still the agreement see to achieve
i think that the institutions the soon with other agree will be but we must ensure ensure that us decision also really the observed
the second repeat i morning again our demand that all ships must be less with a  a type the black pandora the must the all ships to therefore not a few or only the new ships and also not only on or year or when the imo this last agree that agrees
we want black weigh the all ships and the as quickly possible
my group the therefore a whole clear and fundamental demand and is the this point not to compromises prepared
the third support we the position and we know that many the the this point with us agree are that a dangerous ship not simply were must to be and then again to sea back must times
if a ship within a period the to months three time the were must the never more see therefore if the three time dispose is chose you look
we must ships the not quality a clear signal give that they within the european waters or within the european ports not longer be tolerated
finally have we still a clear message the the to the ships the see under socalled cheap flags the  therefore the the the black list are
to properly countries as lebanon liberia syria azerbaijan and albania which we all deeply in us heart know that the the part the their fleet not acceptable is
presidentinoffice s perhaps the s cent the their ships there serious shortcomings
we can not allow that this negligent  our seas 
if parliament must we clear make that we their on few years the access to our waters will refuse
again i hope that there between the three institutions a compromise can be achieved to our joint objectives safe to to
we must dangerous ships eradicate
we must us environment protect and end the sea a safer place make
mrs the president mr the minister mr the commissioner i believe not that i need from to to how important the issue the the safety in the shipping is that have we the last year directly had two time in france with the erika and the   and a time in my country greece with the shipwreck the the samina a even human tragedy with deaths
the last act the this tragedy episodes the yesterday when the director the the instance what the samina part suicide killed
what is the position the the parliament the regard the this issue
i like remind remind that the parliament the from the the from the day which the erika an has the the measures we have the commission asked us proposals to do
the proposals have we also dealt but because there few misunderstandings are must i clarify that we the with the french presidency agree are on the timetable therefore to we today also this debate briefly for the second meeting the the council in the hope that possibly already during the first reading decisions can be taken
there is now a agreement on my report and i believe that we with the first reading of this matter can  and a beginning can make with the from the shipping take the hulled oil
the the other reports do the as you know still problems for
as the mr watts already dragging has the there all appear the that the position the the european parliament in many respects many more will are than that the the council i i understanding for and am also welcome with the attempt the the minister to also this two reports as quickly possible in about and about to to
therefore voice i in principle also in with are proposal to the relevant issues as possible still in december to discuss i fear however mr the minister from the discussions the today to must conclude that you what late you has with your proposal
the different sides in the parliament was namely the doubt expressed or we this technical the time the to we have still one week for the debate that in fact the the the the must start and must than in december vote
i can you however the assure that the parliament the available the the the council we will on our reports vote and this than pass to the council so this a common position can be the
we will then this reports as quickly possible again the the agenda places they will for us a priority are and for the next spring provided also the council quickly doing and the bilateral negotiations with success can be concluded can than everything in about and about are i believe fact the that the bilateral discussions successful will are because the both sides is this the good like available
than come i now back the my report the report on the from the shipping take the oil the from the shipping take the hulled tanker is doubt a important step forward
this is fact already many years ago with the  by the imo a beginning that made the is however good that this from the shipping take the tanker now the up although this speeding course not magic is
that have we with the   given that was a young hull tanker
there must also other substantial measures be taken example for the classification and the control
we must the all fronts the fight draw
therefore has the french presidency there good the done the to the international maritime organisation the imo to use and this the to insist the a solution this is namely a international problem and for international problems are international solutions need
also the initiative the position the the commission was important this functioning if a type sword the damocles and was a means to pressure from to exercise the the imo in the direction the a rapid solution
the group the the imo is indeed to a principle has now must only still few issues be clarification but the most is clarify
what direction to we now in fact from in my report
the the large oil watching i the timetable the the imo the the international maritime organisation
the the second category the  tanker watching i when there differentiated positions are in the imo the common european approach
i believe that we end a balance have achieved
one protect we the environment and ensure we for safety in the shipping but hand are we not the the competition in the shipping and the international prime the the market
the the small tanker have we a  welcome between the tonnes the the imo if limit the and the tonnes the the commission if limit the
we want a compromise between the do and the requirements in the with the prime the certain areas the europe and the with particularly the regions
mrs the president i i have we today a very important step forward the the parliament has a clear and clear position welcome the regard the the proposals the the commission
we are now the available the the council and hope again that this issue as soon possible can be break we are all both in the council in the commission if here in the parliament very sensitive for this extremely important issue
mrs the president mr the president the the council gentlemen colleagues the shipwreck the the erika the december the last year and also the recently accident with the   have clear made that there restrictions suffers the the force the the inspection and  with particularly for what the the control the the construction and the followup the the  the the ships the the authorising the the  under their responsibility are the
the is here however more than elsewhere the task the the public institutions to the the wish the the citizens meet to to they must initiatives up the the conservation the the environment guarantee and guarantees offer for a optimum safety the sea
the international level there there enormous differences between the classification with particularly the the area the the competence the the inspectors the development the the  and the the the inspections however technical requirements to the change to to has the commission a proposal to amendment the directive ec tabled that the all vessels the application is with including the ships the oil transport and that the legislation contains the the member and the by them mitigated classification taken are to respect
the mentioned proposal is examined in the commission regional policy transport and tourism with respect the the opinions the the committees environment and industry this
there is also consultation committed with the involved sectors and there are many discussions held with the french presidency order a for everyone acceptable text the to to the without can be approved by the two legislative institutions the council and the european parliament
the result of is this report the the parliament to amendment the the directive that the various points improvements by the sent mainly the the a strengthening the the classification if valuable means and instrument to safety the sea to guarantee
point is that nothing in this directive must be interpreted if exception the the absolute and  duty the the  to concern to to for the maintenance and the exploitation the  ships
then the the the a harmonisation the the requirements which the classification must meet the responsibility for the allocation and in necessary case the suspension and withdrawn the the european recognition the left the the commission the the the times by a committee
this must account be taken with the highest and the number accidents and disasters the the by each the the involved classification  ships
there the worked for a quality the the  to preventive reasons order accidents the sea to prevent
one the called that the classification on a own system the internal controls have to the quality the their services in already their base to measure also the responsibility and the control the their regional offices and their staff must the clear rules be subject
hand the the that the inspections only should be carried by specialised inspectors the only to this end are appointed there must not contract be concluded with inspectors the the any way relations maintain with the shipowner and this last must in not case links have with the register the the ship
also the an to more transparency with particularly for what the the information on the outcome the the inspections the the ships the  and restrictions and the changes adjournments or  the classes
this data must the available the the european and national authorities and the alerted to be the and they must for the public accessible are
also the the transfer the a ship to a other classes change the register on the the the correct compliance the all still  conditions and the application the all still not  recommendations
also must the commission and the member periodic control and monitoring exercise the the implementation the the directive by the the european level recognised organisations
to finally the the the commission called that they strict rules and measures for the maintenance the the ships establish and the responsibility the each the the involved parties defines
in this respect had the first proposals the the commission and the by the parliament tabled amendments to objective the system for financial liability the the classification and  specific in to complement
the commission has however already a second package measures for safety the sea announced which a system for financial liability the all the the accidents involved parties the developed shipowners charterers classification etc
therefore has the i i not sense that we here now under the different groups a debate on the financial liability the the classification open that only a part the the problem its completely rearguard is and the final approval the the text only but delays the seems i better that we this issue in the framework the the second package discuss
let we now progress make so we in first reading to a achieve with the french presidency can to if there during the next council the ministers the december a agreement with the european parliament before can the first package because still this year final be approved
pollution the the sea or by accidents or deliberate caused is a the the the threats the the marine environment in western
this region is a the the most industrialised areas the world where chemical radioactive and  substances in the rule in the marine environment be into and by freighter transported
also see there almost no the world so ships if in this region and are also a number  the  the world
there are many tragic examples the  the per accident is caused by oil and ships the other dangerous evoke 
as we just have heard were two the the most recent disasters the shipwreck the a italian  in the channel and the disaster with the in malta identified tanker the erika the for the coast the brittany in the tide they and this serious damage  the the environment
to the the day the today has there the still not serious accident with a murmansk with a cargo the radioactive substances occurred what however more congratulate than wisdom is
the does the the marine environment used if remotest via the many industrial waste
although the discharges the industrial and radioactive waste from different sources no continues the the directly discharge the dangerous substances without idea the the future now published if unacceptable as
we are still with the legacy the the years which dangerous substances simply were dumped sometimes be we there still by so with all very serious consequences the this
we can from a lesson learn namely that when we something wants the fact the still not way is because there not that if way there
in this report the the that there a cooperation the the area the by accidents caused pollution the the sea must be created
there there also need to the definition the by accidents caused pollution the the sea to broaden so the understanding also pollution by means the operational historic radioactive and other dangerous substances includes
also already the there rightly many attention spent the the consequences the accidents the sea the are the operational oil and the discharges the hydrocarbons the radioactive and other dangerous substances the reason to large concern are because they largely go continue
what the the environment does the there not to or a substance by a accident or by discharges in the marine environment rightly is has the environment is how than also the suffer
although the direct discharge the industrial waste including also military discharges the unacceptability weapons a practice is where the member the are other continue such discharges a fundamental threat for grounds and in some cases even a threat for the human safety
not only the life the fishermen the threatened but also the health and the welfare the the citizens the the coast visits or the the coast live
because the marine environment crossborder the nature is what means that pollution in a the area large consequences can have for a greater region must there with the to pollution the the sea by accidents a community structure to be up
the is extremely important that information the exchange on hydrocarbons radioactive substances and other dangerous substances the on sea transported be or in the sea into be or the in sea dumped are because this the does usual was this exchange is namely a condition for the preparation and the coordination the measures the need are to the consequences the pollution for the environment and the health the the human to relieve
quickly action is is to effect to can effects
how longer the take before the a accident the action more to greater the damage the the environment
as is the therefore also to late to arguing the accident still agree the information over water to to
knowledge the the type and the extent the potential problems if result the pollution is also a condition for the right preparation if the is is techniques staff and equipment the the right locations to to also must there clarity there on the risk programmes for the citizens and the environment
the citizens must if there reason for concern there a realistic assessment to the the risk programmes the is important that the citizens confidence has in the authorities
he must there therefore certainly the can are that he by the authorities sufficient the the informed the taken
also has the citizens the right to to know what preparations there are affected what substances a threat forms and what the consequences can are
therefore must there information be published so the citizens know how he the information  and other affairs can to
during the conciliation reached the delegation the the european parliament a compromise with the council that close the the original amendments on all important issues is
in the definition the pollution the the sea by accidents is a reference to  weapons included
also is there a definition the the understanding dangerous substances in agreement with the directive water added so also radioactive substances the can be included unfortunately be radioactive substances not explicitly mentioned
the cooperation includes the exchange the information on  weapons and on the locations where weapons is dumped
the principle the polluter pays is recognised and the member must the account the with the view the the ensured
the  be involved the the cooperation the local level
the the conciliation have we the most things achieved the we wanted achieve perhaps are not already our wish fulfilled but however are we satisfied with the result
mrs the president mr the presidentinoffice mrs the commissioner the up the this first package directives on the safety the sea is without only doubt a the the most action the us parliament in the current year has the
that france is affected by different accidents in the particularly recently by the shipwreck the the erika and then the   for the brittany coast is the responsibility the the whole european union the from learn has can draw
the union has form the its responsibility by proposals for strict rules in to must order repeat the heavy accidents to prevent
i like than also my thank express the minister  the behalf the french presidency with are large dedication and pure this issues the efficient way has dealt
the must the there however aware the to give that this proposals the as the commission industry external trade research and energy stressed largely meet to the the the the relevant areas highlighted legal demands only effective are when they by the member correctly be applied and by the commission be controlled
i put therefore the points to the the i essential seem for the achieve the the progress the with the adoption the this directives and the regulation possible the made
first must the action the the member actually be into in a integrated action the european level
we must the ensure for sufficient and good trained staff that irrespective their country the origin can work and use can make the a standardised instruments
to my wanted conviction must this the term lead to the up the a special force the european 
my expectations the the second package proposals and the up the a european agency for the safety the sea are thereof
the this level must this necessary european coordination the any way to the to
meantime must ships the terms characteristics to the most risky properly be unsafe therefore must we demands that the supervisory transparent action by the basis the a high cleaning inspections measures to take against ships the irrespective their age and their construction in bad the situation
also must they the passage by the exclusive economic area the mile deny the ships the not are less with a   the meets the the standards the the imo and the the a possibly  clarification must provide
we should not forget that as mrs mckenna proposed the pollution the sea largely is back to to the practices the exploiting if operational be defined that like say the sea the tanks and other forms the deliberate discharges itself criminal many more must be in
i am i that aware how gentlemen minister  importance the the database equasis and now also the galileo the we must up
also must there hard action be taken against the cheap  example the  in france and against ships the during the months before the the adoption the this directives the flag have held the a the the does in the table the states which ships more than average are the and ended this table is published in the annual the the memorandum the paris under the it black list
further must be in against complex financial theory with 
i thank in this the the mr watts for are indeed proposals the this area
i thank the rapporteurs and our americaneuropean that they this proposals in recital want take
to my opinion can this proposals a considerable progress mean the essential is for the effectiveness the the resolutions which we to vote so they not dead letter continue the the european territory and in the european waters
the think i not only the the atlantic atlantic but also the the mediterranean sea which the consequences the disasters as we the have seen the agree irreversible would can are
mr the president the proposal to amendment the directive has the the the selection the ships the must be monitored and the the points which must be monitored
the is without more positive to mention that the directive the amended in the sense that they more must be applied that the legislation with particularly what the the selection the to inspect ships must be harmonised and that the scope the the different forms the inspection must be mandate
also would the european union for itself the opportunities must create to ensure concern to to that the current legislation by the member the applied
belgium denmark portugal france ireland and netherlands do that namely not although they compulsory are to the the ships to inspect
in italy and portugal are the existing directives even still still not into in national legislation although they since from
the member must sufficient resources to aside for the controls order the existing legislation the international agreements and the by the parliament amended directive the the right way to can apply
this the specific in that there more inspectors must be appointed and that the powers and the scope the the controls must be mandate with particularly the regard the the compliance the the social legislation and the legislation the the area the the conditions and the conditions the the crews and the personally of
since the the accidents is back to to the human act must the inspections the the crews their conditions and conditions and their level hand part from to make the 
noncompliance the this rules would the must are to the on ship the to the and sanctions to take
the proposals the the commission are moreover somewhat careful they have namely the the a ceiling the only twenty ships
the positions the the french presidency the us know are and the the proposals the the commission example what the the amendment the the  the the ships still further would weaken with the objective the controls with the half back to to are course unacceptable
i am the at with the rapporteur agree that ships the irrespective their age a large risk forms and ships the since more than three year under cheap flag see from our ports must be unsafe
the is also the important that we further to by this ships the see in community waters to ban
objective the this everything is the international legislation the the area the the shipping to strengthen
also am i the opinion that this legislation more would must are the regard the cheap  with particularly the regard the cheap  the under the flag the the member see this you here however present you gentlemen minister is in the case the france to think the the cheap  the the islands  wallis and 
i will this report and the changes the the commission support but i call the members the to also the amendments the the commission environment the the area the the social legislation to support
mr the president mrs the vicepresident the the commission mr the presidentinoffice president the the council first like i the four rapporteurs the i thank
the three reports the the transport are with respectively unanimity the vote and majority majority in the commission approved
we have this reports this indepth dealt and are end to common conclusions has
therefore is the important that we us the this position the
mr the presidentinoffice president the the council the credit you to honour that you the the last at still asked you the vote on the two directives from to to to a agreement to achieve
however is that all what ambiguous mr the president
if parliament to we although the accusation to hear that we the matter have delayed although the president the the parliament the discussion and the vote deliberate the december has moved to this sitting but to now to have we still not few written statement the the council been the on which we discussions would can to on a compromise
i i appreciation for your considerations but we can only negotiate on things the in the council were investigated
therefore can we nothing change we have in the different committees carefully work and the is impossible to next tuesday with our mr programmes on compromises to negotiate in eleven languages because the is the to extremely difficult issues
therefore request i you urgent after the vote afternoon the directive respective the regulation on to take in the version the the parliament
the to we the closest the the objective that we common achieve namely the increase the the maritime safety
the you this therefore on
this where according you adoption not possible is can you in december a common position make
the you ensure that in the council nothing the postponed
we are prepared from january on compromises to negotiate for the second reading the we hope very quickly beginning next year will can conclude
i like there still agree the point that the urgency which you now reduce not there is
the the state example want we in unlike to the council the rules the certainly strengthen
also if that us in december not would succeed would we nevertheless a long step forward to mr the presidentinoffice president perhaps can you the other countries and your own administration far to that they their obligations on the state from the old directive fulfil
if you something do you for more safety the sea must you new inspectors working and strict control out the on the the current legislation that would already a large success are
on the issue the the liability the classification a very complicated issue must we still agree in all upon talk
we have in the commission carefully work and with large majority respectively unanimity us position approved that result must we if parliament against the session also ratify
if you in december just so concord can achieve are we significant progress
mr the president mr the president the the council the is gratifying that we today the package on  in first reading can deal and adopt
as just already was said is however the fact that the countries the the european union in the past affairs if  but a hot heart have  less gratifying
we know namely but already to good that the state in the past not the a state sword was for  we know also that not all classification their control the serious way and accordance the  have done
contrary usually are they this very poorly and casual that handled know is also that hulled oil driving  are
the tragedy is however that we that everything knew and the before the erika an the parliament has this time again the out
without this disaster and without the pressure the the public opinion would we now probably not far are been but therefore is the however a good matter that we today last a beginning the can make
i like the two rapporteurs the i thank and briefly something say on few specific issues
you you said mr the presidentinoffice president that you agrees with the by the mr watts to the take demand the the parliament on state
therefore request i you ensure to ensure that this as soon possible in the council in about and about is
than the the a law and can we agree start
i i must we on the liability the classification if council and parliament together certainly still agree good give from the what today the decided
we to agreement with a international regulation for hull tanker provided in april also a  follows
in the commission are we the agree on a linking between both affairs
if this not possible is must there european legislation to
we hope however that in april a  the the
for this hull tanker have we many new safe and good ships need
i like like that this ships under fair competition the european shipyards be built
the commission has recently a report tabled which that that korea very unfair dumping  the the area the the shipyards
therefore request i you kind mrs the commissioner and also your mr monti in to vote with the for our shipyards necessary support perhaps can that still for christmas done
there there uncertainty under the european shipyards
help you a here so the commission here a clear signal the
we build one the new credibility and therefore should we this hand not revealing by wrong act the the commission
president mr the president the the council mrs the commissioner we have good reports for us are
we must a clear signal give the unsafe  the  also from the eu the the  use the forwarding the than cheaper price can to the classification the their task not good do
safety has a price
we must that fact agree dare say
i would bit want like the the report the the mr watts
if a  in failed remains than must the conditional more responsibility to
that is a very good principle we must that continue continue
a black pandora a black list already the things this are we the fully that agree but i like however a few points under your attention to
who more control bears the risk that the in are ports with wrecks case remains with environmental in the port also sometimes with human tragedies the crews the the their fate be left we must however also ensure that we this attention for have and that we ensure ensure that the port not against the by the measures the good intended are
mrs the commissioner we have a directive for ending or live 
would we also not cannot must have ending or live  because this are perhaps however also a few environmental the we agree good must look
a second point we must invest in people and in crews
therefore will we a number amendments the my mr vachetta support
also in inspectors because the is need if there to little are that this good  the the leave are if i that as must say
we must to finally also realistic continue on our restrictions if regulator
we have rules they be not applied
there are already a number colleagues the that said have
if we look to the  san that was a sails ship
the is built in the speaking under italian flag
the is the over three year three time controlled
therefore colleagues the are not only the rules the for safety ensure
there is more need everyone the in the sector working bears a heavy responsibility
who the responsibility not the the the must from our waters and from our ports continue
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen presidents the january i i you this heavy the the erika originating  let see that the a beach is found
this  the symbol for the many work that we still must oppose to the seas to particularly and the transport safer to make
the erika and the   are the last names the linked are with a series disasters the a attack commit the different systems in the first place the the ecosystem with are maritime wealth and are flora and fauna the for always be the or destroyed
than is there the attack the the social system with the awareness seafarers from the third world this modern  the in farreaching extent be exploited
then is there with the   the attack the the economic system which the  liberal  all  and safety and the the whole standards has elejido itself the under is the are own excesses and clear makes that a community  that the name dignified is to  finished there
who the there today the day still in for the integrity and the benefit circumstances including the transport place
what bodies would there today the day claim the can make that they this maritime movement that rightly the exactly if  control and the links to
no
this  and this  the with their few mandatory and their thirty year the bad weather the broad issuing choose are there the proof the
the the  ships the the planet  meet there  not the the safety and transport there sail dangerous substances
the traditional mercury the the  change in oil or 
faced with this disastrous and cacophony situation which the transport state is europe the challenge made and will the european union eleven months after the disaster with the erika can may that still never earlier a procedure as quickly is developed
the is a political signal that we in own hand have
the is the us to this erika  the to take and the is the the council to this last amendments good to approve
our group the positive the this up procedures the the agenda but has the the  for a better protection the the marine environment not from the view lost
in the revisions the the directives on the  and the  would item the affairs must be the what the the classification and would a considerable increase the the number inspectors in the member must be down however the condition that this member this the resources available to
same wait we however impatient the the second package erika ii that provides in the up the a agency for the safety the sea and a european coastguards
already regret we the delay the the implementation the the obligation on double inspection for  and the withdraw by the council the the proposal on the for  current diagnostics neutral for  applied already according this ships sails or sails are we support this proposal
the clause in this report provides because in implementation according was the the american agenda if the  in april failed
we us there not the risk programmes to take but we us there nor the our responsibility to take
with the package erika i the the basis the for a genuine european policy for safety the sea course in pending the the package erika ii
mr the president mrs the commissioner mr the presidentinoffice the disasters the the the last months have occurred have the lack legislation the shortcomings in the systems and the gaps in the human and financial resources the the light the
the proposals for european directives the the initiative the the french government and the european council to the are has mean without more a large progress
the proposals be supported by the reports the the parliament which we morning debate
the  provides in tightening the the measures against risky ships or   however not in abolition the this cheap 
the  on the classification provides in harmonisation the the law and legislation in the development the sanctions including abolition the the academics and in increase the the claims the accidents
although the hatzidakis provides in a ban the hulled ships with commit the same date if which the american rules the force be contains this report same proposals for a number exceptions the against the objectives contrary this applies with particularly for the proposal for the extended the the term which hulled ships must disappear
my group supports the  and larrea and will for this reports vote
the vote on the hatzidakis is linked the the vote on the amendments the the rapporteur
the two directives and the regulation the we deal forms a improvement what the the safety the sea the is the large important that this quickly in force act
given the extent the the problem continue they however some
as many involved stress is the insecurity the sea the result the deregulation and the see under cheap flags
because the lacks competition the in the first place an to quickly transport against as low possible costs what the expense is the the safety the environment and the crews
we must the that the liberal idea counter the the a high extent the safety the sea
i like there again the point that in the before european decisions although this a step in the good direction mean the liberal ideology not the the denounce the the
the by my group tabled amendments the the  with the to the social rules are than also rejected however the time again the emphasis the the the important the the human factor
there must with urgency measures be taken to a end to make the the social dumping and to change to to in the working the the crews what the their status salary training and conditions
to to to to a effective control must the number maritime inspectors strong be extended also must the qualifications the this inspectors be improve
this must financial resources be budget there must many more measures be taken to the classification more to make
cheap  must be banned
we know now what the consequences are when this ships the rules not failure
the the indeed time that the european union the is working for a real reform the the maritime system
this requires a strong political like and the financial resources to still more controls possible to make
in the framework the the second package proposals seems the i the important to the promotion the a sustainable development the the transport still agree seriously in recital to take this are still more security and  need
mr the president a year ago were three region programmes in france affected by a the the worst disasters from the european maritime history the shipwreck the the tanker erika
a few weeks ago is the west the france affected by a new disaster the shipwreck the the   and today only feels the european parliament the established to the from to speak on a greater safety the sea
i am from from a  the any day the heavy price pays for the shipwreck the the erika and for the enormous and permanent damage the by this disaster is caused the the flora and fauna the the  brittany and charente
the consequences for the economy are dramatically the tourist season the the year was disastrous
also the fishermen the slaughter the bivalve and fish and the from are very been affected
the people the this region programmes had a greater drive the the community institutions certainly the price the
i am however pleased that the most ask the by the members from the french  are formulated are included in the proposals the the commission a ban the hulled  intensification the the  and assessment the the classification
the is other unacceptable that the parliament the original proposal the the commission for a ban the hulled  has weakened
mrs the palacio has there a few days ago in  still the out that the united states the are managed to within a year any rigorous rules the the area the safety the sea by to to
why must the european union there according the agenda the the parliament than as long on do to by means the the amendments the the rapporteur the hulled  to remove
also already is the double mandatory not only this is a important measure the considerable technical improvements require
the seems i dangerous to the american and the european agenda the other from to link
in this case have we good can look to what waters and what ports the dangerous ships the way were
us parliament would there good the do to the the proactive united states not the impression to give the a  europe that the advance the way the the least resistance favour
how can we the a new accident justify that the european parliament a as slow agenda has adopted only because must be waited until the imo the global level a compromise has achieved and that while the countries the place offer the cheap  the a important voice have but itself not the to the most working properly where the is to improvement the the safety
how can we under this french presidency the our citizens explain that the european parliament is back the the necessary policy the financial incentives and financial  which the the parliament measures were proposed to the transition to double inspection to up
us parliament would the most strict legislation which by the commission proposals are tabled without and fully must support in place the weaken
the parliament would precisely further must to
this first package means only a first step
there must how than also a system be up which the individual responsibilities within the whole transport be defined to a end to make the the current certain
we hope that the second package measures which we proposals will received in this need provides
what technical measures there end also will be taken a the the main causes the the insecurity in the channel and the north the the atlantic atlantic remains least as there nothing against the taken the exponential growth the the shipping what issue with the enormous extent the the ports the the north
is the now really reasonable that the area which the port the rotterdam are clients him the broadening to aged
would reduction the the shipping in this area by means the the again active the the infrastructures the the ports the the atlantic atlantic and the mediterranean sea not a the the most effective safety are
this is the thrust the the two amendments the the reports the the gentlemen watts and hatzidakis the i behalf my group i tabled
the the the member and the commission substance to give
because when there nothing the taken against the  the the channel and the north will this inevitably to polluted routes the a continuing threat forms for the safety the our seafarers the  the our coastal and the quality the our maritime resources
the is because not the intention that the french coastlines the from the the european shipping be where now agree  and than again heavy oil or  directly
mr the president safety is in various forms the transport serious in affected
compared with the more than people the annual the the asphalt die are the victims the accidents less in figure but each kind counts and also is the accidents the sea still more the creation in risk
flora and fauna with particularly the birds are victims the oil and other pollution
the is sad that there first a tanker for the french coast had shipwreck with disastrous consequences before the now present package measures is up a set measures which we very satisfied are as with the several reports
i shall i to the  on the state
very rightly the the rapporteur that that the the the service the a tanker more says than the age
also part i are incentive to obligation the the  dates 
are regime for ships the repeatedly are were than the a flag to the three year the a black list are is very sensible on
the i i the question how cent the the ships would today be refused the basis the this criteria
the extent or the status the such  example a candidate must lead to erosion the the measures
say on the responsibilities the the conditional should the tasks the the alerted not overshadowed continue
the refusal the the involved port to the erika to let  has probably the extent the the disaster serious increase
the would the presidentinoffice president the the council imitation also in own country item the affairs to to
mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen minister i i there good note the taken that you recognises that us parliament a effective institution is
this efficiency was the day after the shipwreck the the erika
the the i still clear for the spirit we were the a day in december in strasbourg in sitting when we the this disaster heard
i dialogue immediately the extent that and was i there the from the the the aware that us a serious disaster to wait was the the our french coastlines still long are encourage would fail
we were deeply at and demanded that the commission immediately with proposals would to this are in march the us tabled
since have the new disasters occurred a few in greece and later the disaster with the  
we are the was that our seas and oceans change in a valid
in the third reading the the  the a number principles mentioned on by accidents caused and deliberate pollution the familiar sea the tanks according what the polluter pays
despite continue the problems poignant also already be there steps in the good direction taken
is the not as that we since march time have lost
where is the political like has
the council must the by everyone achieve strict measures to take the the area the  classification the responsibility the shipowners and  and the finally the the  the the the scandalous way have behave
in brittany the still always waited the compensation
the this at are there a number proposals the us tabled and must there still a number to
the cohesion danger here find to are especially this there a number existing directives in the affected are example the directive on the water
this whole procedure must be rationalised there must a directive be up which the affairs the international level be simplified
gentlemen minister in pending of must we the technological research the the area the pollution the sea up
the is the large important that the this the is technical area the exchange the knowhow and the cooperation the encouraged and supported order our natural maritime wealth safe to can to
the can we only but hope that we with all how measures this pollution the sea can prevent and our maritime wealth can protect
mr the president i like here briefly the  the the socialist group on a the the proposals explain and discuss the is to the proposal to amendment the the directive on the 
others have the also already said there had farreaching measures in the with the competent organisations and the checks be adopted to the tough the the ships to guarantee
the current situation is downright unacceptable
although the proposed text in this respect interesting and valuable improvements by are the new initiatives us i inadequate
the public opinion calls although the us that we quickly action as the presidentinoffice president the the council rightly has stressed but this almost must not the expense the the content the the text to
i hope that not only member the the by you chaired council the established feels to us the swinging to regulation we wish that the text minimum guarantees offers and we are that convinced that everyone this understanding for will can people
there are two points which we carefully the opinion differences one the issue the the liability and the extent and  the the compensation the in very the european union enough and identical must are subsidiarity is here from den because and hand the dubious independence the the classification
this independence must how than also be guaranteed especially this today the day many shipowners and  itself part of the the organisations for 
that is unacceptable
short on the whole taken seems the text us inadequate
that basis that the council the are position will continue consider we the sense the document good to approve in the hope that the in second reading in positive sense will be amended we want however also not against from respect for the rapporteur the mr ortuondo and the excellent work that he has done what under more that from the compromise the years heading for the second reading
balance the proposals are interesting but inadequate
mr the president since the  the the tanker erika is there under political pressure a package measures has to the safety the ships the sea to improve
the question remains course will the measures in the practice to lead that plimsoll ships from the shipping be taken
i am there still not as certainly the
i must namely unfortunately see that we with this measures in the margin fiddling in place the the real causes to combat
mrs peijs and i have a  carried and i would like the the commissioner want hear can you i tell what there happened is with the ships the honduras from the register has achieved
are the really from the shipping taken
and where are they than
a second question is the where that ships within minutes through internet can be registered in cambodia
the third think i that the classification serious must be tackled
they can now too their own the to
i i a  try in to build by the limited liability to increase which the is to relatively small sums but often is there at nothing to to
but i i i the opposed against unlimited liability because this  working and the is counterproductive
how the the with the state
mrs the commissioner the current rules be already not good observed late are the new
there the simply to little money by the member free made
the is many now and little paidup
there must i i more commitment to the the council to more resources the available to to and better sanctions the to force
also the tackle the  or writ
i i a very together
i will vote for the line the the rapporteur to ships to against the three year frf with a ship see that the the black list the signals to this flagships that plimsoll controls not by the unacceptable can in europe
we want they not in our ports and not in our waters
measures short are binding to the safety to the desired level to to
that is bad for the people that is bad for the sea for the environment and for the image the the sector
the would more the hands those must we
i support than also the initiatives for a european maritime platform
mr the president i would first the rapporteurs want thank for the good work the they done have
the is extremely and extremely need to with the view the environment with the view the safety with the view the fishing with the view the tourism to ensure that there not then happening what there now happened is
the was in first body to the erika but the same at was there somewhere otherwise in the waters the turkey a tanker to the soil
the  san was sails but did chemicals the a certain form
there are greek ships as but without that there a storms in the near was mr  sank
short the is not always storms in the channel what the would must are to possibly the plants the the shipping there as i heard i
the is end to eight to ten thousand ships the  are
with other words we have the on a very has problem
age the ships plays a role but not the the
maintenance plays a very important role
this have we the now on and crew
the human on the the whole issue is the large important
i concentrate i just the two dossiers state and decommissioning the hulled 
everyone has the agreed and that think i completely rightly that the current the necessary is for the state still not achieved is
some countries must but agree very good in own house look what they this must do
there must resources in the countries this available the be people must trained be etc
with particularly also the president the the current transport has in are country in the next period also if is he not president more still a whole hope work to out
short not only look to the technical on the the story with particularly also to the  and not only laws make because what i the must the control even still the being to course time but first must we that other but do
but the enforcement is again the most
with the to the hulled ships a few short comments
i am not fortunately with the fact that the ships the to tonnes that the from are the the whole
i am also not satisfied on the fact that the financial incentives from the whole dossier achieved are
i think that the proposal not good developed was but that we in the next period the this type affairs the certainly financial  or  must intrusion in this type affairs
the third think i if we talk on this type dossiers that clear the that the relationship between the the one on our  and the the other on the fact that we still still fossil fuels use not link has
i that we new ships make phased the the one new ships sails create than have we then a comprehensive fleet while we fact to other forms the  to must
mr the president what we here today the the denounce to follows continue from the fact that the shipping per definition and since eaten a globalised sector is that should we not forget
in the shipping to we the dynamism the anarchy and the dangers against the as characterise are for very the globalised economy
there is however not policy for the shipping
the work the international organisations as the imo enough not to this sector to regulate nor help the technology with its black weigh etc us here many further
we will course for the proposals the the mr programmes vote because this are important steps forward
there is however absolutely need the a good organised and integrated policy mr the president a policy which we can action and regulate the the this suitable scale but in any case the european scale therefore have we mrs the commissioner our hope located the your second and third package measures in the direction with measures for inspection  coastguards ports plants and also with fines for those the the the full sea the the necessary mean
you know because that this fines always still leading are than correctly work through the use the the facilities such measures must however the european level be taken and in very the union be applied
to finally have we mr the president amendments tabled on the social situation and the employment
this are us motivated not only by feelings the social and political solidarity but also by 
all accidents the we in greece have had are to due the supposedly human failure the cherie  people the three days long behind other without only adjournment had work that is namely find behind what here as hypocritical mistakes the mentioned
mr the president gentlemen minister mrs the commissioner gentlemen members the is not coincidence that the number disasters the sea increasing
our political duty forward not only that we with urgency measures take but also that we the existing law and legislation apply
we can there not longer that enough against the population the by such ecological and economic disasters the affected to say that we the problems the the item have the agreed give and they the next time will prevent
if we credible want are must we with urgency action take in place the us to lose in  discussions
the time the the ordinary compromises which some also predict that they difficult be are is over
the is now the highest time that there rigorous measures be taken and that everything in the work the the to this the international level in to to and the the outdated international conduct for the sea to review
the is unnecessary that to point that the safety the sea under the international right regards precisely because pollution never massacre the the borders the the territorial waters the a the country and usually its origin take in international waters
we must therefore not longer information give since that not effective is but strict measures take the a area where this the most arrive namely the financial interests
given the urgent situation which the environment state must our political measures strictly are
we must a end make the this hypocritical situation to must the financial links between the shipowners and the classification the the denounce be the and must the on parties shipowners  insurance and maritime bodies be involved the the seek to a adequate solution
the reports the we today deal must the the give to a genuine policy the the area the safety the sea that however in not case limited must continue to community level
we have on the political and economic resources to our decisions the to to and the implementation that the to force
to finally like i that point that the americans not the us have waited when they to the the the shipwreck the the exxon exxon in already in the more makes act endorse while the shipwreck the the amoco amoco in france already in place
we must now last the political courage have to our ambitions the ecological area where to make
mr the president ladies and gentlemen we to the one  after the other first bse and a ban the meal and now is since yesterday the the  in germany a ban the meal
yesterday heard we also from the commission this was was the three commissioners the fact better would must know that the commission not prepared is the support the the european shipbuilding to extended to after december
what want we ourselves in the european union fact still more spirit
i understand there nothing more the and the  smile in their 
the environment and the transport have however sensible and encouraging action when they they the than if response the a accident the first erika need
we have that package quickly been and we have the quickly dealt this deserves the parliament applause
a second package the already the started
you mr the minister the sorry i that to must say says becoming we would possibly and refers than to cheap flags as  etc
why does you that however not now immediately in place the tomorrow
you said we have the possibility the safety to improve
makes you than the this possibility use now and not tomorrow
the parliament demand that already as long
the is not the parliament that the the brakes the
you has said that the delay our debt is this can i only but say that this the people sand in the view their is to the attention the itself the are own failure the to lead
therefore to we not agreement with postponement the vote
we must the right signal give
the flags depend any already  i like fact not quickly result to what price than also i like a optimum result as quickly possible
conciliation is here a possible and unfortunately also necessary way
the is however a way and i hope that a any this are best notifications will supplement
we know now each attitude and therefore must we today also vote
what the classification the must i the this opportunity use make that is also my task to again that to point that the readmitted to the seems in the liability you
that understand everyone
apart the the environmental is here the personally fate and the existence the many companies in the affected
the commission like the open again under the look take in the second erika that is good
i am that convinced that when the to accidents the sea is the extremely important is the liability the very the chain the involved for view to the and the matter if one whole to see
the is regrettable that the now unilaterally clearly on the liability the classification
the impression is least the
classification are only the first link in the chain the maritime companies the liability the other involved the however not against the light taken
here must therefore still the a and another be outpaced
we have a fully picture need the the responsibility and therefore the the liability the all involved
mr the president this proposals are motivated by the exceptional and dramatic events the the repeatedly have occurred to the the two accidents the the in less than a year have occurred namely the shipwreck the the erika and the   asking the public to urgent measures the european level
this means that our responsibility the this area greater is than the what another area than also and that we i i the hand in own house must to
with a up procedure which our four rapporteurs hatzidakis mckenna watts and ortuondo larrea responsible are has the parliament result given the the wish the the public
we peasant one and same objective after which i think that the the large important is the drafting during the partsession the december the a proposal and the achieve the consensus between the council and the parliament
this is because what the citizens the us expect if the themselves again a accident arise than will we this strict the be judged
today is has that two the the proposals can lead to disagreement with the council and that the achieve directives and regulations evening not can be public
myself regret that we because our  or perhaps because us lack the selfrestraint now not the ten days the available have the we as hard need have i regret the also that we the hand not tackle the the council us goes and which we in december on ten days to exactly to are the result would make which we in this parliament all to
personally regret i this and i think that this strict will be assessed
i am the opinion that the position the the parliament the regard the the most the this proposals precisely is since the with exception the the  very demanding is
mr the president i would than also like see that there a common position the welcome the regard the affairs which we the today probably not agree can be namely the responsibilities the the classification the criteria for the against the ships the black weigh and the systematic inspections
the french presidency has a decisive the given the unfortunately only on two or three months to result will lead
we take all risk programmes with including the the risk the a settlement
that think i regrettable
mr the president also i like the rapporteurs thank for their successful reports
the have they attention paid the essential aspects to the safety the sea to improve
there must however still many done to the safety the sea really to improve
what the state the is the the important the rules still further the to more and the control more to make
the accept the classification and the control this must also be improve and especially risky ships must be subject the comprehensive controls
i like still emphasise that decisions the within the european union be taken to the safety the sea to improve not enough are
example the issues the responsibility must world be resolved
that applies also for the demands on hull implementation
regional legislation is the not there must global treaties in the framework the the international maritime organisation imo be closed
example for finland is the the essential important that russia the the agreements involved the
the  and risky ships must the ensure ensure that they really be  and that they not under other flag again in the shipping be the
mr the president i voice for all technical measures the a improvement content the the safety the sea although i the shortcomings that regret
the real problem is however the political like to farreaching measures to take and to to apply the regard the all parties the the community and the environment in risk to to profits to make
the is the not only to the shipowners but also and especially to the ways this are large multinationals companies as is has the the shipwreck the the erika and the  
this farreaching measures would not only the must have the  the dangerous ships but also the the adopted the this ships and their cargo
also would this large companies financial responsible must be the for the damage the the already their goods are caused
the  the total and shell respectively the  the the erika and the   had immediately must be  until the damage the what nature than also the under their responsibility was the fully was compensation
justice know not instead for  the not  or fine can pay and is even far their funding goods in up to take
the inaction the the large companies the the that this more power have than the elected bodies
mr the president to to start like i both the commission if the three rapporteurs thank for their important work on this issue
the disaster with the tanker erika in the autumn the has ensure taken that many people have responded and that is a good matter
but the was still better been if we the to the had  in place the later had responded
than had the disaster perhaps prevent can be
the provisions where we today a decision on must take contain many positive points
that applies for both the more demands for the construction the oil better rules for the state if the strengthen the the rules for the classification the here also a result the will are
but there continue for i still many questions on
what has the example for sense to ships from the ports the the eu to against if we they not from our coast against
according realistic estimates can we most to ships per year against
is that sufficient
the last large disaster which oil was into a few weeks ago was with a sails ship
that means that a compulsory introduction the this type ship nor a safe solution is
a second matter the i like raise are the deliberate oil
the transport the oil in the baltic is since doubled and will on few years  are
any day find there average two new discharges place
recently  a ship that under a cheap maltese flag speaking oil in the swedish waters the  
then speaking the ship the port the tallinn in estonia in
now is the the question who there can action
according the regard has sweden not the right to the to act since the ship the not more in swedish waters is
estonia can nor action take because the ship this not damage has caused
malta like the are on probably nothing do because the country many deserves the this type ships the under maltese flag see
the this way is again a  who
with the proposals the we to far have tabled be this problems in the future not resolved
i am therefore the opinion that there the this area still very many must done
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the there not doubt that safety the ships and therefore safety the people and environmental very serious issues are
this have we strict modern rules need the the compliance which closely must be ensure by reliable inspectors and good  public
our proposals task not access to ports for ships the our seas in large risk to registration the all events the the during a journey arise so after a possibly accident exactly the  can be consecutively gradual introduction the the obligation to hull ships and improvement the the rules and standards for classification and inspection
the is course a cold up such strict conditions and restrictions in to to that accidents theoretical least hardly still can prevent
this will however cancels are if not account the taken with other important factors the the this issue a role play
the must the shipping not  if a enemy but if a for improvement mooring friend
let we measures take for the safety but let we there the for ensure that this the shipping and the trade as less possible pain send in any case must we any measure out the more evil than good does
with other words we should not subjects
i am there fact the convinced that we all the prefer give the moderate but  rules over strict but  rules
let we not forget that five member and so the i not wrong understand must i the mention that greece the not under this five is by the commission be accused the noncompliance the the previous  directive
i i can we a balance achieve if we take the the proposals the the commission and the imo and the the before reports the rapporteurs of deserve fact our genuine congratulate
the you is course that we with already our regulations never each accident as that with the greek raise samina can prevent what do we if a master decision are ship the to let are the a good in card take and running rock
president today talk we on maritime safety the the hand the three reports which i the rapporteurs the i congratulate
the commissioner is immediately after the erika started with a extended package legislation but the truth area to say that the legislation except than the liability fact at not as bad was
problem was and is compliance the legislation control and sanctions the 
today discuss we the safety the ships and  the state and the classification
unfortunately act the time to reduction
first the 
the is not as important that they maximum unlimited responsible would are
the most can that however not pay
important is that they the important and  failure simple closed be negotiation lift the matter end story
that will they a document  make
that seems also better than sanctions the not in to recover are
than 
i am there personally for that ships the see under a cheap flag the the black list not in the european  and the territorial waters the the union be permitted
i see the practical difficulties of however the
but is the not poignant that the  the the erika the maria programmes still more than a year secondarily has  before the were was and to the scrapped sent
why was the maria programmes not by its  from the shipping taken
what has the  fact done
different in my view completely irresponsible states offer a registration the the only minutes in up the through internet a in all respects virtual matter without only inspection
cambodia mrs sanders said the already
cambodia  with a such possibility in the  what does the commissioner with ships the the the way are registered
to we wait to the are were
once twice to the oil the the  is
the is clear that a bona society its ships not in cambodia 
second example honduras
ships were even in  view to bad for words
my question the the commissioner is follow we such ships with a  and 
because the question rice however what  has this nonmobile wrecks covering accepted
where are they across
i think that we without a such  not more credible can operate
the same the  must not the the european union stop
some the our member make itself a culprits the their registers
also for this countries where the systems the paper good seem but in the practice nothing proposals must a strict stand in the practice apply
if the not good applies for them same if for other hypotheses  their ships not in our ports
mr the president mrs the commissioner mr the minister gentlemen mr programmes during this debate are already several times the disaster with the erika and other serious accidents the there has each the us can the list make
in us recent and less recent past have the regulated disasters occurred that is terrible but the would normal are if not of by the human caused was
we must us therefore a important political and cultural point achieve the is time that the  disappears and rule for prevention
the tabled reports to in the direction
the is significant that the commission the through the commissioner wallström morning has reiterated that a modern policy for safety the sea priority has a another important point is the statement the the council this statement compulsory us this issue for end december final the to the
this is a good beginning but there must still more done
the commissioner has morning already few plans announced and i mention there still four harmonisation the legislation and organisation the the countries training the the population and recognition the the rights the lecturers the up the the european bureau for the shipping with the full involvement the not only the member but also the local and regional bodies the traceability and the the arising principle the compensation the economic damage both the environmental
gentlemen mr programmes let we ensure that the slogan the polluter pays not only but a slogan remains
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes mr the minister mrs the commissioner transport the sea is doubt a the the transport the the environment the least damage cause
that that because the international measures to the safety to improve and pollution by accidents back to insist certainly any success have had
despite do the still still serious accidents for as recently with the erika and that concerned us that is a sign that there urgent new measures must be affected to the safety the sea to improve and to prevent that the still more accidents arise with serious consequences for our coastlines seas the fisheries and the tourism both the economic area if for the environment
what the this three new proposals for the safety the sea can i not otherwise than the rapporteurs congratulate they have in very short time let see that us parliament determined is new measures to take to the safety the sea to increase the controls and the  to improve and such accidents not longer to tolerate
to my opinion is the our duty there more the to to see that the existing directives be observed and new measures to take to ships the not the the demands meet the wrecks the the sea to against
apart the this package measures must the european union also the global level active be they must in international the agreements make for the improvement the the safety the sea
if last like i stress that there a system need is to information from to exchange between the member on the safety in areas where many oil  so there persistent monitoring the taken and there in any risk quickly can be responded
mrs the president i would any comment want give behalf the socialists the the industry
the is a good matter that the commission to action is have and the first the to a political solution has given
the parliament calls that in the involved sector effective and coherent measures the implement be the
we know that the accidents the despite the available technology increasingly  be especially to due are the the crazy competition which the shipbuilding the victims is become the result of is drop and a absurd economic management the the outdated fleets that still but the best to expression is in the drastic cuts the the area the maintenance and crew
the cause the the accidents is not only in the age the the ship or are category but also in the incompetence the the shipowners and the other operators the everything in the work to to the costs to express
there is here already about on the this however methods the the use the under cheap flag nonmobile ships to the permissiveness the the alerted and the complicity the the classification
to a end to make the the insecurity the sea must the guilty the adequate way be punished this are costs linked the the involved world must parts so the european sector not again the suffer the
we to agree agreement that  be the for compensation in the with personally injury death or material damage and that the member this thresholds to own free can forces we accept however not that the ability the the classification the measured the their extent or more still the the number inspectors that they in service have
we base us would the the results the their  therefore must a the the risks adapted system the civil liability be applied
now would i the still just want have on portugal there is here already to referred
portugal supports the amendment the directive but opposition the against the abolition the the classification in smaller countries
the assessment the the activities the the classification must the common criteria based number accidents incidents  and pollution by  recognised ships
the highest will not fall as there not international coordination the guaranteed the politicians and the entrepreneurs must the hands in other we and a compromise drafting that the operational logic carefully revitalise
mrs the president recently was europe affected by a number successive accidents with especially oil the many caused costcutting
this disasters have enormous damage caused the the marine environment and the the means the the people the the coastal
our electorate questions us now what the european parliament does to such disasters to prevent
i like mrs wallström and mrs the palacio like thank for the action the they have taken the the area the maritime safety
both the the proposals the erika i if the the proposals the erika ii have they very certainly quickly action and work the a better law and legislation on the safety the sea
by the gradual abolition the hulled oil will the safety the the  increase
my mr programmes in the commission regional policy transport and tourism have said that the the gradual abolition country community deadlines must be applied
i like my mr programmes thank for their typically approach and like everyone urgent ask to already in a agreement to achieve
but what we not must forget is that we with double or even  inspection not absolutely can guarantee that there not accidents more place
the is the as that new technologies and improvements the the draft the a vessel a important contribution can make the the prevent the accidents
i think that the decision that the commission yesterday took to the already earlier the timetable on regulations for  the to the a good decision was
just if my good friend mrs langenhagen am i very concerned on the situation in korea i was therefore also welcome to hear that the european commission this issue before next year may in treatment the
mrs the president the sinking the the erika was to due the the age the the ship and the the fact that the a hulled tanker was
further was the ship in maltese hands while the crew the indian nationality had the sank   was other a relatively new sails ship with a italian owner and a community crew
we can there therefore not i from be and our peoples understand there already at not resumed more the
i think that our reports the a specific point some there the to little on the seafarers or on the human factor in the general about
more than the the accidents is to due the a human mistake but such mistakes be not for nothing made
there is a social cause the the basis course plays the composition the the crew a role
the conditional would this composition must control and inspectors would monitoring must the the the situation which the ship state and the the social circumstances which the seafarers the board the are
in action the that the conditional under more compulsory is better measures to take to the interests the the seafarers to defend what the their health safety working and rights i question i the or this treaty the good the applied
the seems i appropriate to the memorandum the paris to change order to can for in a systematic and effective improvement the the inspections and social circumstances the board the the ships
i am the opinion that the safety the sea only actually can be improve if there more account the taken with the seafarers
mrs the president the is the highest time that there decisions be taken and carried still not year after the disaster with the erika is because now again the   
the is than also not surprising that our citizens the ask how there the again a such disaster has can place
some members questions the the why there not earlier measures are affected i understand that but we should not forget that the parliament the commission and the council perhaps more than ever demonstrated have given the their like to quickly action to take
not only the european union can now effective measures take with the to the waters the a directly important for its represent but also the imo will the next months action take to such measures the global level by to to
in february on have we a memorandum issued to the european union the imo and the 
this initiative was from the france and is to the has to the the the shipwreck the the erika the commission has already in march proposals tabled
already during the first meeting the the ministers the transport under french presidency is there demonstrated given the the common like to action to take also the parliament shows the now 
as is the debate in the plenary sitting on this issue to the been and has the parliament proposed to a debate to to on three particularly important issues to the then on this issues from to speak
this everything shows the that we time not in the routine the the past will continue to
after the suppose the the amoco amoco is there the last year although action taken but the affected measures were not enough to the this unsafe situation the sea the head to can offer
i like therefore the work stress the the this level are done i can i find in the opinion the the rapporteurs and like say that i their reports can support
i am that convinced that we together with you that like say with the european parliament the by the commission proposed texts must improve this applies in the particularly for the issue the the black weigh and the against the ships
also am i the opinion that clear must be the what responsibilities the operators have the operators play because a central role in the guarantee the the safety the sea and therefore must their responsibilities be disproportionately
i like the mr jarzembowski let know that the council not the find is to a compromise
we must the the highest possible level consensus see to achieve on the safety the sea
the is here not to a compromise between the those the strict legislation and the those the less farreaching legislation
we must consensus achieve on common standards the this area
we should not  on a compromise on our responsibility to a system the to to the for the the safety the sea
the parliament the commission and the council will therefore to the council the ministers the and december the basis the consensus must work
i i this suggestion the a number rapporteurs good understand
that is also the proposal that i you the this at formally can do
the is i i still to early to the conciliation to speak
we must the negotiations to the council the ministers the and december up so we our common positions also the basis the a qualified majority can the
i like with particularly the used talking in remind to
the welcome positions will then by your parliament in second reading can be adopted the the beginning the the new year
the issues the we deal are sometimes indeed complex and technical the nature
i i understand that the translation good the time had take for this issue
we must joint demonstrated give the our iron like order the current rules in the marine transport to change the for the the safety the sea
i hope that we the short term our proposals public can make what the the classification the state and the from the shipping take the the hulled ships as you already you indicated mrs the commissioner are this proposals important but not enough
the second package measures is need to the operators greater responsible to give the monitoring to up and the transparency to increase
a the the members used the term traceability
i can i behind are or its idea already
what the ships the can we not just everything allow
as must we know when ships repaired are and where they from the shipping are taken
we must this ships because from our seas and oceans against
with through the the  that part part the the second package will we the this point progress can make
to finally like i say mrs the president that we still not have on all elements the the research that i up i let out after the shipwreck the the   some members have here just already on about
the   was indeed not old and was for the double inspection and a double soil also had the crew the european nationality
we will soon on the results the this research have this results are moreover for everyone the important given the important human aspect that by some members mentioned is
we must look or seafarers indeed be exploited and how the is the with their lives and working also must we know in what the ship good is maintain
already this points can because the crucial important are the the back the the causes the accidents i think that we also the this area progress must make
mrs the president before i the action abandoned like i all present thank for this interesting and valuable debate
i am welcome you to can inform that the commission agrees with the majority the the in the three reports to the take amendments
we differences although the opinion on a number points but i hope that we this today agreement can achieve
like like i you say how the commission on any the the three proposals think
i like start with us proposal on state the does i pleased that the parliament the very involved the this proposal shows
my thank is in the particularly from to the mr watts in are amendments address he because a clear and strong message the  operators and negligent 
the most amendments have the the the proposal to access to the community waters to refuse
this are the amendments and
amendment to amendment the article a the the proposal the the commission the the all amendments the the parliament a central place in
this amendment includes three points first can the commission the find in the abolition the the  since there not clear the there between the age the the ship and his quality
what further the criterion on the lack the a black pandora the board the supports the commission a wider and up imports the black weigh the board the ships the am between the ports the the eu speaking this point must however in the  to be included
the is here therefore not to a rights but to the place the this specific proposal formally must to to
the  is up to to control or the international demands be observed and must not the release the new legislation
within few days will the commission a proposal adopt for a directive on the safety the the shipping including also a obligation to a black pandora the board to have
the third element the amendment is the proposal to a ban in to to the all ships the three year under the flag the a the the black list mentioned the see this list was published in the memorandum the paris
according the proposal the the parliament can only already the basis the this criterion full fleets from the shipping taken be
would accordance the amendment the the parliament the directive with immediate commit in force act than would fleets including the the malta cyprus russia and panama that the the fleet the world has from the shipping taken must e be
the is here therefore to thousands often also quality good ships this situation would not conform with the objectives the the state
the commission the the prefer the its own proposal which the criterion the the flag in the the the with the  the a ship so the negligent operators a clear and strong signal can be given
short the commission can only with a part the amendment agree
the amendments and have also the the the refuse the access
the commission can the amendments and fully support but amendment only the partly
the delete the the  is for us acceptable but the enlargement the the ban to the territorial waters the the member not
in the directive the not on this enlargement about in the text the because that the refuse the access only the has the the ports the the eu
what the other amendments the can the commission the find in the amendments and although the wording somewhat amended must be
the commission vote not in with the amendments to and with and the amendments and
the most the this amendments are new proposed considerations the outside the framework the the directive the
many the the changes have not the the the state other changes to on aspects the already in this or in other directives are included
as contain the amendments to and with and amendment new considerations the almost not the all also but somewhat the have the the text the this directive
in amendment the about on state in the for  current assured in directive is already fully for in the enforcement the the provisions on the working the 
amendment is unnecessary since already in the current procedures is down that the not failure the the rules with the to work and health as down in the  the as if negligence if the rules not be observed can that to the arrest the a vessel lead
amendment has not the the the state but the the competition between one the ports the the atlantic atlantic and hand the the the north this amendment the therefore not the safety the sea
amendment is on the by the rapporteur in amendment proposed changes on classification but extends the scope the the measure from to the exclusive economic area which only the member part of in this respect is the amendment in fight with the maritime
than like i the now like have on the proposal for the up introduction the hull oil
the am i to can say that we the the this point almost whole with other agree are
the pressure the the member the the international maritime organisation have exercised has led in a timetable for gradual abolition that meet is the the most european ensure and that same in agreement is with the american law the the  the this timetable deserves our full support
the commission used the year if absolute deadline for the abolition
this proposal has if main objective the up abolition the old hulled oil to this objective to achieve are we prepared agreement to to with the delete the the proposed financial  according what the port and  the different way be passed
expect the that during the sitting in april next year the imo the timetable for abolition formally will adopt
the commission can the find in the wish the the parliament that if the imo this timetable not favour there a  must be adopted the based is the the text the the european parliament also can they the find in the idea that there in that case a system for the waters the the european union must to be up
in amendment the the report the exactly same said although the here earlier a political commitment the than a legal has text
this amendment require therefore also not in the final version to be included i hope that you the with i agree can are
to similar reasons can the commission not agree with the new amendment this amendment has although the the the very important issue the the safety the sea but is not relevant for the proposed regulation
the commission rejected also the amendments and because the only for this regulation a additional committee would must be up this does not with us policy to the number committees back to to by use the already existing committees
the am i that the rapporteur in amendment a reference to the inspectorate has included we can us in the main the the proposed approach find but are the opinion that the  what more can to the text more to make
finally like i like the  with the to the directive on inspectorates deal
the this point there again not large differences and the commission can the amendments and accept with exception the the paragraphs a and b the the amendment are added
the commission afraid that some amendments the to confusion can give because the terms be used the not part with the usual terminology the the imo
i objective here the the amendments and the is here according the commission not much to fundamental problems but to more linguistic issues the possible by linguistic lawyers can be resolved
special attention must to be spent the the inspections the one by the classification the the member and hand by the commission must be carried
the objectives the the parliament and the commission to line
we must to the the clear difference in the integrate the both parties
the member must the feeling have that the  the selected is to behalf them to inspect its tasks to full satisfaction the the member effect
the is the task the the commission to ensure ensure that the  remains meet the the in the directive has substandard also must the commission the work the the classification to control
in this respect have the member and the commission individual control the not same must to be carried to the reason can the commission the find in amendment that currently the table is
in this amendment be member again compulsory inspections from to to the commission rejected from this view however the amendment
also the moral aspect is the important
just if the parliament am i the opinion that a  a inspectorate not too must can influence
what that affects mean the spanish versions the the amendments and a clarification
the commission can this than also accept but rejected amendment and the part the amendment that the has the point k
the commission can the not whole find in a number other amendments mainly because they the opinion is that the in this amendments express issues already adequate are discussed in other parts the the text
the think i the the amendments and the additions a and b the amendment the in a express subject the already adequate dealt in article and while the content the b already is included in the 
also can the commission to legal reasons not agree with amendment and the part the amendment that the has the point k
the commission can amendment not accept because only the community a legal is and the union not they rejected amendment on point k because the in fight would can are with the made horizontal agreements in the framework the the general agreement on tariffs and trade
amendment and the part the amendment that on point h is are quite ambiguous this amendments have the the agreements on clear objectives and indicators for classification
the amendments seem unacceptable restrictions to contain and must therefore to be rejected
objective the us proposal is ensure to ensure that there more monitoring the taken the the classification and that the recognition the bad reveal classification the suspended or withdrawn
in this respect can the commission the the assess the the performance the classification not restrictions or speeches the this offices itself tolerate
i fear that the commission the amendments to and with not can support because they on issues to the already in the existing directive are included or because their thrust outside the scope the this directive is and already the other directives is together
than rest us still amendment on the reduction the the liability
the commission salutes your support the the originally by us proposed limit
also is the commission the agree with the clause they subsidised however the more flexible wording the amendment on the comitology over the the amendment which the fully legislative described the
further like i like two comments make with the to issues the the mr stenmarck the the item has the to the the the  in the baltic sea
in this case are two instruments to our available
first is there the directive on  the recently by the european parliament is adopted and by the council is approved
all ships are compulsory their waste to discharge in ports the the european union
the second write we in us proposal to the the erika ii on  that the member in such cases the offences must in to intervene even when the ship the in international waters is
further like i like against mrs peijs say that we us there fully the aware are that ships from cambodia and honduras a threat forms for the safety the sea this countries are now precisely the  against who we us in this proposal on the  want up
i can you assure that after adoption the this proposal a  the two time codecision before he are ship in such registers 
i like like conclude by the parliament and the four rapporteurs again to thank for their in short time done work and excellent reports
the parliament going the now same on two affairs one the stage the the adoption by the european parliament and the council the the proposal on by accidents caused or deliberate pollution the the sea and hand the first measures the by the commission to the the the disaster with the erika are proposed
the is however good to to aware that even with the best legislation disasters not can be prevent
sometimes must we fight against the forces the the nature
to better prepared to are the disasters the sea must we addition this decision work the a sound structure the the level the the community
this structure is need for the exchange the experience between the member so we us marine environment better can protect against by accidents caused or deliberate pollution the the sea
the conciliation was difficult but has a balanced compromise has the amendments the the parliament and the council have led in a better decision that both in scope if content the clarify has won
this applies in the particularly for the operational discharges and  also to now the international habits and the principle the polluter pays better in the text to the
this result is for a large part to thank the the european parliament and the rapporteur mrs mckenna i like the members the the parliamentary delegation and mrs mckenna in the particularly thank
to finally like i you remind remind that the still but a month ago is that the   with a cargo the tonnes dangerous substances the board near  is shipwreck
this disaster makes agree especially clear that strong preventive and recovering community measures urgent need are to our seas to protect
our view are now than also at the the council and course also the the person the the mr  to this exceptional work during the next council to making with a good sound and ambitious agreement
you thank commissioner wallström
no the us is impatient the your speech become contrary we are you precisely very grateful for the answers which you the positions the the commission carefully you reflect
i like again the president the the council thank for the determination which he expression has given
mr poos you you something say on the debate
mrs the president i i a point the item
mrs the commissioner has minutes long about and in the time decades articles mentioned further has they the position the the commission weakened
the is impossible for the members to note to take the the position that the commission with the to the different amendments its
therefore like i my proposal repeat to the position the the commission on the amendments writing the the members to was before the report in vote will be the
mrs the commissioner has you the and certainly heard
i me to hear that there not objection against your request there mr poos
mrs the president a appeal the article the the rules
as we already different times have heard the the council the term for the answer the our written questions not in eight
in place the within three weeks has the council the answer the a question with priority after weeks sent
i like you this very short answer not abstained the first four questions are never the the council presented
i can i proposals that there a  and provocative official between the staff the the council is but when fifteen countries their approval attach the this type answers than think i that you mrs the president there the the council the must insist that the privileges the the members be respected
mr turco i i your message understand and will there on give
the debate is closed
the vote take as moment place
vote
you thank mr hatzidakis
motions on the preparation the the european council to nice
mrs the president the you i to that i briefly views why we our resolution withdraw
we draw the in because almost the whole content that literally is included in the joint resolution the by the presidents the the most groups is signed
i am satisfied that the this way the results are recognised the the commission constitutional affairs the november had achieved the basis the a transparent and balanced compared the the different positions
nevertheless am i that convinced that us parliament in the sight the nice are position better to the had can to by the each the the important and difficult issue programmes the the intergovernmental conference a specific individual resolution to turn in place the they together with all other points the the agenda the the council in a few resolution to deal that had the commission which i the this at president am proposed
that is under its regulatory powers and as has the parliament in the the eve the the council the amsterdam and in other similar situations in the past also action
mrs the president i think that the powers and the initiatives the our committees not contained should be
you thank mr napolitano
the resolution the the commission constitutional affairs is therefore withdrawn
joint resolution on the preparation the the european council to nice
the parliament the the resolution the
report a the the mr brok behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the progress the the the implementation the the common foreign and security is made ini
on amendment
mrs the president i like proposals the amendment such to change that the start with the words  in this respect the will and the commission
the words and the commission must therefore be added and the last seek    the commission to open a  via in taipei must be removed
if the author the good take can we this as do
mrs the president this week were we the members the the commission foreign affairs during a the our meetings vexation surprised by a distortion the the item what to led that we our debates to three time to had interrupt
we know that this distortion was the request the certain members the this parliament
i like the president his ask to its me the to offer the our guests the turkish minister the foreign affairs and are ambassador the mr  also like i the president ask to today its about to do the the members the the parliament the this incident in scene have the
the president has already indicated that they this incident regrets further has they its me offered the our guests
the secretarygeneral will on this incident report produce order repeat the such incidents in the future to prevent
explanations  a
the rapporteur has right when they the local dimension fails in terms the the strengthen the the european strategy
because local authorities awards programmes and ngos programmes in closely contact are with the situation the the basis and because they the knowledge have to local  to a success to to must they involved be the any strategy
i support the idea to a european year the local development from to to also am i favour the a maximum use the new technologies to the unemployment to reduce
the create the employment must also in the future a the our top to continue
 a
mrs the president i i for the  voted that the conclusion the the conciliation on a community framework for the fight the pollution the the sea is
i i about with chaos pensioners the i have said that they this programme the i support especially because the a european programme is that the sea clean like the
further have they i said that europe for them long there because many ships have a joint crew with italians french english spanish therefore they are very satisfied that europe the collective commitment for a clean sea
 a
mrs the president wish has if representative the the party the the pensioners against the  voted
i i against voted if protest against the fact that the the european union still still not manage to this issue programmes to properly to regulate
those the the deal with the regulate the the considerable and working the board the ships as the title the this report says are not in the the to to that seafarers in very europe the right have to earlier than others with pension to to
many seafarers the  are see their grandchildren not because they always the sea are and parents see their children not
this is not jobs if all others there be many more sacrifices asked than the another work
the is therefore rightly that seafarers if they that want earlier with pension can to than other workers
behind the  the disasters the sea the unacceptable health and safety the ships and the exploitation the crews is the criminal  find the the profitseeking and the politicians the this capital the regional national and international level must
with the policy the the eu the the unbridled behaviour the shipowners only but encouraged there be under pressure the the movement although measures affected but this are inadequate and be also never applied
the regional decisions on  undermine in fact the role the the international maritime organisation imo with this decisions be the safety still further weakened this they taken be in the framework the a economic war to the profits
meantime late the the profitseeking with cheap flags freely are the to the is the situation in the shipping the global becoming backwards
by the privatisation the the classification has the the unaccountability behaviour the the capital even still a heart under the answers into the classification are now in hands the the shipowners
there must immediately preventive measures be taken for ships with flags the the member the the eu the must the existing legislation although improve but in first body ensure for application of
the must the system the the classification change and this again transfer to the public
also must the competent authorities the general scale thorough control and inspections out to the tough the all ships the in the territorial waters the the member see irrespective their nationality and must the with through the  such measures also the international level it see to to especially ships with cheap flags must however in the monitoring be taken
the inspection the obliged must done be by public with good trained staff and the necessary technological equipment the must also the  in the room active be involved
the must strict rules prevent with sanctions for the violation of also must a such policy provisions cover for the composition the the crew account bearing with the increased needs a contribution make the the improvement the the lives and working the the crews and the  real participation give in the decisionmaking on the shipping especially when the to security is
although with the proposal to amendment the the existing directive and the  not meet the has the the real needs be this steps in the good direction the therefore will the european members the the communist party the greece for the report vote
what this very serious and important issue the like i first our rapporteur and the commission regional policy transport and tourism thank for their patience and for the remarkable work that they have done
the parliament has the legislative up what we moreover the this institution if expect further is the parliament the managed to the the area the safety first to are by principles to to apply the the already long time has recognised
mark watts is there the three ways in managed to the by the commission laid measures the to more
ships the the last months more than twice in a community port are held must from the shipping be taken for us parliament must the the next criterion to be applied
ships the three successive years the flag to the a country that the the black list is placed
the countries the this cheap flags make and the ship the this illegal and takes practices use must as to be prevented
there must a black pandora the board the the ships to to
ships without a such black pandora must in the future from the community ports unsafe to be
the citizens want that we measures take and see our vote are tension meet
we have because not elected for a up procedure to this in the such to let delay by a conciliation with the council the months can take
the risk the accidents and pollution is to large and than i i the still not agree on the working and the wages the the seafarers
let we therefore dynamic to work to and this  adopt
the will contribute to the conservation the us environment and improvement the the quality the the life the adoption the this report will us therefore to honour serve
if all  the ships all  and all classification the good like were would superficial unnecessary are
unfortunately is the often to as many possible money deserve the expense the the safety the environment and the staff
human mistakes are for the the part a result the the congestion the  and the inadequate training the seafarers
the proposal the the european commission see there reassuring from but is not pressure against fully from
the is therefore good that the rapporteurs watts vachetta and piétrasanta have tried to the disposable to close the in the proposal the the commission still open continue
they to for  ships under cheap flag and ships without  from the previously to against  and the in sea sea the tanks against to to and the number inspectors to increase
important is that mrs vachetta proposed to the  the working the nonconvergence and the training the seafarers to improve
i support all improvements and regret that some of now still not majority behind the to
i i for the report the the mr watts voted which the proposed the quality and the frequency the the inspections in the ports the the member the the european union to increase
the commission the for the  to harmonise and the the conditions the to a ship the access to the ports the the member the the european union to refuse if basis for a community maritime security is that the minimum
this provisions have the objective the monitoring the the safety the ships in our ports to strengthen but let not to dangerous ships from our territorial waters to against if they not in a the our ports ensure
the restrictions the this proposals are therefore clear
as can be regretted that the commission not proposed a really european supervisory to the model the the coastguards the the united states the to up
we take pleased with the institution the a european system the monitoring and exchange the information between the member
the european parliament must ensure ensure that the member the necessary financial and human resources available to to this system the rapid response and exchange the information the effective way form to give
there are in the european union approximately inspectors responsible with the  by the member
that figure is far under the number inspectors that need is to in the ports the measures in practice to to the we proposals
the rapporteur has a number proposals done to the binding nature and the effectiveness the the inspections to strengthen
in i also fully behind the sailing irrespective the age the the ship for ships the in the during the the last two year two time the the up were the
i think the measure the minimum and hope that we further can to
we must there therefore the ensure that the today by us proposed measures by all member the the european union be applied
the member are therefore for the application the the measures responsible
without additional inspectors and financial resources will the proposed controls in the ports dead letter continue
we expect therefore the the member that they the really for the maritime safety working
hatzidakis a
a pensioner has when i him his that we this document the the mr hatzidakis would deal designated could you this not earlier the think
and indeed this measure is the amiss the  the mr hatzidakis is the  ex  the this need the risk the pollution the the sea to prevent
if we here earlier the had thought if the mr hatzidakis here earlier was been in the last years would he certainly have proposed ships the a double mandatory to for and than had we very many disasters can prevent
i question the mr hatzidakis therefore the behind a another initiative to already namely to a double mandatory also compulsory to to for constructed the oil and other dangerous substances on our motorways transport
if the the safety the ships like guarantee and the life the sea and the environment like protect must the the without behaviour the shipowners combat strict  take for ships and hurrying the the safety infringed been punish also must the the conditions and the training the cabotage improve and ensure ensure that the crews such are up that the meet can be has the the increased needs the ships
the obligation on hull ships can contribute the the improvement the the safety and the environmental but is not magic the itself is this not sufficient condition for the tough the ships
we are the opinion that a any change the the port and  for hull tanker not the expense must to the the income the the  and the other funds which to now to this apply were into contrary the current  must be maintained for hull ships and  be increased for hulled ships
unfortunately the here in the report not reference the made the be the conditions for the from the shipping take the replacement ships even still worse
in the report the proposed the ceiling tonnage for ships the are least the the in the regulation the the commission included regulations for ships below the  to increase the to  us i will the the number ships that dangerous is for the safety and the environmental still greater be
this ships be also especially used in areas with very pressure coastal
to above reasons will the members the the communist party the greece against the report vote
the would better are if there not hulled tanker more were but such ships are to still built
rightly like the commission prevention that europe lagging the america
hulled tanker must here not can continue see if they elsewhere after or are disappeared
without timely measures would we old risky ships the in america are disposed here to
hull tanker reduce the risk the oil but the the not from
with particularly in the baltic the estonia and russia is the movement the tanker and the rapid passenger the last years strong has
this is the opportunity the  as large that without additional support and control  still higher be
there is therefore all reason to also this proposal the the commission the to more just as the rapporteurs the the other today  reports on safety the sea that have done
unfortunately does rapporteur hatzidakis the opposite
he afraid a deficit the tanker and like the as wait the measures the global
the proposal the the commission has my support
the  make the proposal other inadequate
in the first place must be clarification who the what at responsibility bears must the social standards for the crews in eight be taken must the principle that the polluter pays again be introduced and must the the area the materials be 
in that framework must the construction the hull ships especially if the ships for are for the transport the pollutants or dangerous products as quickly possible be 
europe must because not behind the the legislation in the united states the with the more makes act the hulled ships between and want eradicate
we must the least the pace the the united states follow and meantime measures take to to prevent that  to the countries the the third world move
also is the replace the the outdated fleet a way to the shipbuilding a new impetus to give
we must now already the the improvement the the sails system think
many technicians point the the difficulties in the with the inspection and the maintenance the the area between the two inspection
the proposals the the mr hatzidakis limit the proposals the the commission however in
as the mr hatzidakis very good has explained have they the objective the maritime safety to strengthen without the the competition the lowest price from the view to lose
the mr hatzidakis the therefore for the the maritime insecurity a end to make without however the causes that the to tackle
this regulation is in the good direction we must however any derogation and each postponement the implementation reject
we must the the proposal the the commission to
the am i that the european parliament the last on the three reports on the maritime safety has can express i regret however again that the to long has took to a the the priorities the the french presidency the the european union to a good end to to
the issue the the maritime safety was the the community political agenda to the the the shipwreck the the erika in december the reports which we today almost a year after the disastrous shipwreck have voted were by the commission under pressure the the european parliament presented
a second disaster namely the shipwreck the the   in the channel was need to the first reading the the texts to up
i i for the report the the mr hatzidakis voted and congratulate the rapporteur with are persistence in this delicate dossier
the obligation the the double mandatory for oil and the gradually from the shipping take the the oldest ships are measures the in the good direction to and our rightly  fellow a specific answer offer
however regret we the duration the the period which hulled ships still should see already can the scope the the measure explain that the implementation gradually happening
we must many attention to the the adjustments in the timetable for the from the shipping take the the oldest ships the possibly by the council can be proposed
in each case must if effort date be were
the unilateral decision the the united states to after hulled oil to ban in american ports for anchor to to is indeed a threat for the transport in the territorial waters the the european union where the opportunity there that the ships the continue see
the timetable for the from the shipping take the the ships in our waters must therefore slate are the that the the united states
finally should we not forget that the obligation the a double mandatory for oil only a part the a really european maritime security can are
this decision is important but inadequate
a more legislation the international level must a fundamental objective the us maritime security continue
 a and hatzidakis a
the disaster with the erika and other reign including the with the tanker the braer for the coast the shetland and the sea empress or wales make part from the a long series wishing the  within the waters the the european community
this disasters have not only irreparable damage caused the the nature and the environment but have also the means the the local population destroyed
the the disaster with the erika were the local fishing and  serious damaged the is however important that we not only to the direct consequences the reign look but also forward look to the harmful effects that the long term
the is the essential important that the victims the  a real compensation received
also is the high time that the community measures on the safety the the shipping be up and that there more the controlled as must there under other a end to be made the the see under cheap flags something what in the practice still more does
the responsible companies the ship and the owner the the cargo must for their negligence to pay
the this at the there still still not money the available the to real compensation from to times what but already to clear was the the disaster with the braer the this disaster was the fisheries the the shetland islands not compensation
when there a accident the sea happening lead this often to large political stir the time the the disaster must the stir than reassuring seem often has they not large changes to result
let we ensure ensure that in very europe appropriate measures be taken and that the experts lessons also really result in decisive political measures
the package legislative on the safety the sea is welcome and necessary
that has the disaster with the tanker erika the let see
i i voted for the reports on
a safety the ships prevent the pollution and considerable and working the board the ships the the ports the the union spirit
b hull oil
c implementation and exercise the control the ships
d accidental or deliberate pollution the the sea
also i i for all amendments voted the the proposal the the commission improve and strengthen
the is with particularly important that clear the that the principle the polluter pays fully will apply
the last years is there a substantial increase the the number oil in under other the atlantic atlantic the channel and the baltic what also a greater risk with the of the accidents the a negative influence the the environment have
now there the opportunity that the  in the baltic drastically is enlargement since russia the plan is to several  the to to the the  and in the finnish wave where the russian nationalise the seems to to concentrate
in the city  not far the  is the instance the a large  for exports the russian oil already started and the there still one in same area planned
finland has with support the the directorate environment the the commission tried the russian authorities on to to to the out the a environmental in agreement with the treaty the 
russia is the this request unfortunately not entered
a any oil has a devastating effect the the finnish wave and the baltic
the baltic is a very vulnerable internal the already strong polluted is by discharges the the industry theatres and the agriculture
the commission and the council must now the request to assessments  accede and the russian authorities to know give that in the future for the whole  with russia a  requires is
 larrea a
mrs the president i i already earlier said that i in the past i dangers
this measure the the mr ortuondo larrea which the inspection and control the ships be regulated is extremely important as all inspections and controls
i remind i that the national inspectors the the ships had control the board were
they concluded the the in a spend with the  and were there sensitive with cigarettes ship strong spirits and who know what still more from
inspections are a serious matter
i think that we must achieve that european ships by european inspectors be monitored because there must a end to the the habit the governments and the the council to inspections to refuse especially when the is to the  the the sea and the our coastlines
the other seem accidents follow other the
after the recent sink the the erika and the   for the french coast must the european union in action to and the classification the  in the shipping the strict control
therefore is a european legislation essential
this report improves the control the ships and provides in procedures and harmonised rules for the inspections the the a progress in and deserves therefore our support also already find we that the rapporteur not far enough is
the mr larrea has the because the on a harmonisation the the  for all member but not on the ships from third countries the outside the european union be controlled
what will a  or  ship in bad the prevent close the our coastlines to see
when will the european union last decisions each ship that not the its rules meets the access to the territorial waters to refuse
europe is usually quickly with environmental how long will the of the enormous financial and the different interests the the member still wait to the maritime safety the to tackle
when will the union sufficient human and financial resources available to to this task from to to so the not the a intent remains
the is in the good direction we regret however that the the responsibility the the polluters controller shipowner charterer insurer not exactly describe that the not preventive or repressive measures includes to the close sea the the tanks the most source the maritime pollution the to tackle that the not in a  the the  provides and that the not each manifesto dangerous ship irrespective are age the access to the territorial waters right
directive ec must now urgent be review especially because malta and cyprus respectively fourth and sixth fleet the world countries are
in combination with this community action must the international maritime organisation be  and real  to to the  to do failure the imo would than a effective instrument to the example the interpol are
we hope that the council are responsibility soon the the will take
the is to the quality the us environment
from the recent sink the the tanker erika and the    that what important role the classification in the transport play
we can us rightly questions to on the reliability and effectiveness the the controls the they out
in the first place is the recognition the the classification without previous control or harmonisation the european level the task the the member
also from the training the the inspectors the the companies the country to country
nothing guarantees moreover the independence the the companies the flag or customers
the proposals the the rapporteur for a harmonisation the european level are certainly positive
the european union must itself resources provide to the standards for classification by a recognised and competent authority to do apply
this are additional human and financial resources need
the classification will must be controlled and as need punished by the recognition in to draw
if the a accident happens must the financial responsibility the the recognised organisations be recognised and harmonised
to better with the material and economic but also social and environmental account to the must the sums the the mentioned expenses be increased
i support the report and the by the commission proposed changes but call the members to the also the amendments the the commission environment health and consumer good to approve in the particularly the on the harmonisation the the rules for the classification and the status the the inspectors
the transport is in the last decades strong grown and the costs are fallen
there the port against by the storms to continue  and by also the other times the risk to accept that there fatal accidents place
as the costs the the infringed the rules lower are than the the the failure the rules will companies the a maximum profits want the wrong choices continue make
the  succeed there still still not in to itself the inspection the the tough and the  the  to organise
they let this work acquisitions the international lot companies the on are the the system the 
the ship the the voluntary if customers report can if diverted to a another bureau that less strict demands the
the is a step forward that the recognition the classification can be withdrawn that the liability the harmonised and that classification always their data must transfer the the competitor the their work accept
the is  better if the control twoyearly the and that classification not on should are the only one large company that ships building  or fading
but the best would the are if a harmonised control directly the responsible the the authorities the
the report the the mr ortuondo larrea is the last the the measures to the maritime safety to increase
the is a important measure because he the classification for ships the
in the report the in the member a certain public proposed the the area the quality and expertise the the classification for the recognition which the member and the commission future together responsible will are
the proposals strengthen also the responsibility the the classification and for in financial sanctions and suspension or withdrawn the their recognition the accidents the the them can be turning
the fact that the classification after the shipwreck the the erika in december responsible were taken remember us the their important role in the assessment and prevention the risk programmes the the the which the ships the are
the the under the flag which a ship shipping is responsible for the tough the that ship
i hope that the involvement the the commission the the recognition the the classification and their greater responsibility the end the the cheap flags will mean
in that perspective must we without this measures in the countries do apply which the fleets the the safety and criteria the the european union will must meet
the problem the the classification beyond the borders the the european union
the commission must itself than also the necessary resources provide to the application the the new measures by the member but also by the countries to control
finally must us common maritime security the international level follow to the demands the we the our ships to must to the fleets the the third countries be extended
maritime safety must not subject are which only in emergency if again a new disaster our coastlines affects the about but must by a integrated and  policy the international level be tackled
preparation the the council the nice
mrs the president the group union for a europe the national states has not for the resolution the the european parliament on the preparation the the council the nice voted because the whole is motivated by the like to the supranational institutions to strengthen by the all member uniform rules the to to
in the particularly are we against the call for a european constitution least if the national constitutions this than subordinate be made
we are against the integration the a binding charter in the treaties the a terrifying process the drifting in the would to
we are against the general enlargement the the qualified majority the enlargement the the codecision and the lifting the the compromise the luxembourg
the federalists have here the french presidency and minister védrine attacked and said that the a failure would are if the council on in nice not to a agreement would to
that would earlier a large success are the the eve the the enlargement have we because not strict supranational seniority built and far from europe need but precisely a flexible europe that close the the citizens the and the respect for the national democracies based is
what the agenda the the summit the nice the believe we that the charter a statement must continue that the commission one commissioner per member must counted that the the reweighting the the vote in the council the parity between the large member in eight must be taken that the majority not to the most issues as immigration international negotiations on services taxation and social security must be extended and that closer cooperation also outside the institutional framework general must be accepted
more in the general will after nice other negotiations the start must to but this time the in the good direction the institutions must be now and the peoples must again control can exercise so europe not superstate but a network the national democracies the
mrs the president in unlike to the mr berthu are the party the the pensioners the i the honour i in the european parliament to represent and myself those the a reinforced link between the member the the european union
i think even that this parliament where we member the are more courage would must create we would just if during the french revolution a constitutional sitting must forms and us in the  the  must data you mrs the president would our  must are
you the than course more a  than a  and we wish you course not to that you the same way the your end is
what i like say is that the european union a real union the member must be with a parliament that the in the centre the the legislative is
mrs the president also if the european institutions after the european council the nice be reformed or if the rivalry between the leading circles the the member any institutional reform does failure will the european union also in the future only the interests must the the changes economic classes the large industrial and financial groups their before and profits
despite the already just bombastic if commitment statements on the democracy and the interests the the peoples has the debate within the institutions nothing with the interests the the workers or the majority the the population to make
we choose certainly not party in the been between the spokespeople the the three or four large countries the the european union want control
for us is the also not the important or the charter the the fundamental already than not the the european treaty the our in that socalled charter the the fundamental has the because the basic rights for the workers not want into but also the door for social dismantling paved
in place the the social and human the a higher level to relationship will the charter the easier make to they back to under
therefore have we although we us not on the details express against the whole voted
we vote for the resolution but we want a few comments places the the next points
we are positive the the enlargement the the use the a qualified majority in the council
we are however the opinion that this  not issues must cover the under the second pillar the
if there use be made the a qualified majority than must that us i joint to be with the codecision the the parliament
we support a reference to the charter the the fundamental in article the the treaty
we are in the current situation however against the into the the charter in the treaty and the into the the treaty in the constitution
within the foreign and security are we positive the the fact that the crisis a prominent place has been
the condition that the  control to on the conference the the reinforced cooperation want we this also our support the give
the research the the summit in nice offer not many hope the a good end
a satisfactory agreement is still not in sight
the still competitivity fight to the power between many member  the sight the possible compromises
many member with particularly the large seem there only the from to are to the own power in the future to improve
the majority the the tabled resolutions late see that also the european parliament not no the the temptation to nice especially if a success to as when the own power the extended
this can i i not in find
 only is not sufficient to the european union ready to make for the future
for a european union which the various peoples peaceful can coexistence is first need that the governments in between respect and  seek to a tenable balance
the institutions the the european union must in the are their tasks to role without that they the the the stoel the the member to are
also in the future must any country truly to are right can to in a union the founded the justice
this eight i a crucial criterion to the treaty the nice to assess
i wrong this bowis however unfortunately in the motions
full justice expect i in the grow rich the the  saramago
that must there us now not the from to this justice already here the earth to seek also if peoples the the european union
the danish social in the european parliament vote for the joint resolution on the preparation the the meeting the the european council in nice the to december the is under other the intention the current intergovernmental conference the to conclude with the signature the the treaty the nice
we are still opposed been the the very comprehensive agenda the the intergovernmental conference the the majority in the european parliament with motions repeatedly has try in to to
we have this in the different votes also still let will several the the by the groups tabled motions to than also serious concerned the question in what the summit the nice the will succeed the union ready to prepare for the enlargement
the most task the this summit is ensure to ensure that the eu efficient institutions the
the condition this is that there between the small and large countries a balance the found not only what the rules in the council the but also what the composition the the european parliament and the commission affects
this both institutions ensure there in important extent for that the eu the further the the common objectives and the crossborder tasks concentrate while the rest the the member the left
the enlargement is a large project that not only from the countries but also from the current member supported must be
a number members the the european parliament atypical a constitutionalisation the the treaties which the charter the the fundamental in the treaties the included and the introduction the majority the all areas
the is to our opinion not sensible in the current intergovernmental conference to continue insist the this points and also itself the the influence the the parliament
that have we the the votes the today noticed
we have for the report if whole voted because we the state and government under pressure want to to in nice to a good result to to
the the eve the the summit the nice and without the the results forward to are like i the french presidency with this large effort congratulate i congratulate also the ministers the effort or time have spared to in the committees and in the plenary sitting regular with the european parliament the mind to to exchange
although i just if many others sometimes i regretted that prime jospin of the  in this six months little has said know i that he are ministers constantly strong has encouraged
i like in the particularly the mr védrine and the mr moscovici thank and mrs martine the who we the social agenda one the the strong points the this presidency to thank have
the is now matter the summit the nice to a success to make and everyone there with the to the reform the the institutions to to to the last concessions to do to to a good agreement and a good treaty to can to
to the charter the the fundamental a greater legal force to give must towards also in the treaty itself be referred
the social agenda must soon be carried we must therefore expressly the the important that point
finally must we a directive on the public services the the encourage to that this urgent is the not more 
a week for the summit i i personally good hope
i i the the hope expression want give by for the resolution to vote also already am i the not agree with everything what the the
in are resolution favour the european parliament as usually for more participation for are own institution
the would a good matter are if the european parliament also with same enthusiasm would discuss how the turnout the the elections for the european parliament increase can be
the elections the would a average turnout the less than have had without the  the in a number member applies and without same national elections
the enthusiasm that the european parliament the the day the for more participation in the eu is not something what very live the the electorate
the current democratic debate in europe is based the the national elections in the on member
for a more democratic eu must the national parliaments more influence the the work the the eu have
pt the is worrying that the debate and the by the european parliament adopted resolution not january give on the developments after nice we make us especially ensure on the further reduction the the sovereignty the small countries if portugal the strengthening the the federalism and the military dimension the the security and defence and the weak inadequate measures the social area
what the intergovernmental conference and the the arising reform the the european institutions the consider we the completely unacceptable that the the power the a small number large countries seeks to strengthen the expense the the  the the majority the the small and mediumsized countries
this intention is doubt might with the enlargement the the qualified majority closer cooperation in the framework the a hard core the application the the closer cooperation the areas if the security and defence the proposal to a european constitution the to to the basis the the charter the the fundamental that content particularly limited is and in various respects many less ambition some than other similar documents the both international if national level as under more the case is with portugal
they contain not agree a specific fulfil the the during the summit the lisbon commitments obligations with particularly for what the necessary strengthening the the economic and social cohesion the the is therefore the fundamental important that the council are positions invite
he must the new wave the company and concentrations a stop drain the current  interrupt and the macroeconomic policies change we expect with other words that the council the the full striving the the achieve the quality quality employment which the necessary rights are linked the poverty and the fight against the social exclusion
if representative the ireland must i say that i the content the the resolution on the european council the nice the just by the parliament is adopted very disappointing think
the the reform the the treaties the the european union must account to be taken with the interests the the smaller member
if that not happening danger the vulnerable balance that the basis is for the function the the european union lost to to
i like with particularly a number elements under your attention to which i think that they in the future the stability the the union in risk would can to also like i like a number questions raise with the to the democratic legitimacy the the decisionmaking
i think that the enlargement the the votes with qualified majority not good proposal is the proposal deprived member namely the right to the the right time to decide or a policy communitised must to be
i am the the opinion that per case examined must to be or the being the unanimity to votes with qualified majority made must to be
i am there nor favour the that votes with qualified majority and the codecision automatically with other be linked also here am i the opinion that per case examined must to be or the engage must be extended
i i already know if absolutely opposed the the idea to the common agricultural under the codecision to to i i therefore also not more the this point in
i am the agree with the promotion the the rights the in the charter the the fundamental the the european union be mentioned i am the there however not that agree the charter in the treaty the nice the to take
i think that we better length research can do to a another alternative as example the join the the european union to the european treaty for the rights the the human
the is possible that in ireland a referendum will be taken to the the the final agreement the the fifteen member in nice the
i can you assure that in ireland the current negotiations closely be followed just as that doubt in all member the case is
we must careful to work to and not anticipate the the public opinion also must we not decisions take where our population still not ready for is
participation the the european union has for ireland very positive process and i believe that  a the the factors is been the the a role have played
if we want that the reform the treaties and the enlargement the the european union a success be than must we there the certainly the are that the european population fully behind our decisions the
there must than also not decisions on the development the the european union be taken the the european citizens the the union risk to 
any democracy is because based the the confidence the the population
lose the european union the support the the population than lose they its exist
the french presidency has the birth the the political europe announced well the summit the nice will only but the europe the the defence and the union the the trade strengthen
in the framework the the nato will the european union a new world help impose the little to the fate the the palestinians the and the sanctions to the railways and the postal the facto to liberalisation
the accession the new countries is a pretext to a european integration to strengthen the only the industrial groups must
the those the a liberal europe increase not only the misery the peoples the already under poverty its to but to also a political project the they want a core the rich countries the a comprehensive european market control
the european union the also the role in the new liberal demands the the wto and the capitalist globalisation
by article the the treaty the amsterdam to change would europe the majority the in the council currently with the to the trade the applied enlargement to other areas as public services intellectual property health and education
the approval the a social agenda is 
the charter the the fundamental will not new label without future continue but danger the liberalism in europe still to strengthen
together with them the refuse the world to like to reduce will we the the alternative social summit participate
the vote the the conservative members the today reflect our opinion that britain part must of the a europe that less does but better and not the a europe that more does but worse
today could the members the the european parliament choose from two types reforms the the european union
a conservative approach the the paper on reform the the commission the the european union in the to less to take but the better
the resolution on the summit the nice is however the draft for a european union the more within and everything worse does
the reforms the be proposed by the member  harbour on the paper testify the healthy sense
the population the britain like a reform the the european union to this more responsible and also more to make
this reforms are firm policy by the conservative members the the european parliament
the the other on are the socalled reforms the are included in the resolution on the summit the nice but little understandable for the citizens outside brussels
the reforms make the european union only but more and will the distance between the union and the citizens increase
for the enlargement have the reforms not only usefulness what example a thorough revision the the common agricultural the would have
this are the points where the members the labour and the house house their support the attach
pt the parliament has just a resolution on the summit the nice adopted the the next characteristics some
not the the issues which the member the during the preparatory work the the igc carefully disagree were the the adequate way dealt this has to result that all important leftovers the amsterdam still still unresolved continue
the parliament does distance the are right the participation and quiet if a tools the this way must the partisan interests national faith and the governments in place the are obligations the before the the citizens after to to
they offers despite a benefit that the further recognise long not as trivial is if the the first face perhaps seems namely that the less its member the the the silence the the parliament can those the before the the member the their institutional power in all community bodies wish to strengthen in this respect play the large and smaller countries right
the large member can the for the protection the their interests not the the parliament professions they can the parliament in the future institutional construction not against us play
the resolution stressed still a another important point by their forces to pool are the delegations the the small countries the managed to prevent that the remaining countries during the debates the the next week in nice a political victory in the waiting where
we are although not if victors from the bus has but we have also not defeat ago
in some cases come you with silent a very end
this everything declared why a significant silence a positive voice justifies
i i without hesitate against the joint resolution on the council the nice voted
the electorate the i here represent are the fully disagree with the made choices
the text makes the the future and still further  enlargement use to the strengthening to questions the a system that now already in  state
if that the only solution would are
if us continent the not few other way would can be organised than according the largescale that as you know originally for a hard core the five or six countries was developed
why would we the impossible try and for the enlargement the the union and the representation the countries and peoples a system apply that now already are borders has achieved while a another system namely that the the europe the the peoples a simple and effective solution offers
why can we not recognise that the integrated europe only in name democratic is
the comprehensive to integration  europe is not democratic the violates a the the most human namely the right the a nation
democracy the more in than vote
for democracy must there a dialogue are and to a dialogue possible to make must there a feeling the cohesion are that often with the language linked is
our debates in the parliament seem more the successive  than the a real dialogue
the debates in the national parliaments are loud vigorous and relevant the members in the  bourbon westminster and the  can their views with other europeanism because that within same cultural framework happening and they same language speak
i i also voted against a text which the called that the charter the the fundamental the integrated in the future treaty that in nice will be approved
the text is ambiguous contains contradictions and is room for interpretation
some do if the text nondangerous is we can that not
in the hands the the court the justice the luxembourg by a the are magistrates few years apply a court with a mission mentioned can the charter the most antidemocratic instrument be that the european integration has overnight
the convention the with the drafting the the charter was responsible is of the  the dominant role the powerful groups and our  in the construction the the federal europe was the confirmed
the convention was a body that only a minimum consensus could achieve on rights the the peoples in europe now already enjoy a body that a text has overnight the certainly for a conflict between the law the the court the justice the the communities and the court for the rights the the human in strasbourg will ensure
the european parliament has a last time for the council the nice a position with the to the large issue programmes the the intergovernmental conference can adopt
the commission constitutional affairs has a resolution prepared which the expectations the the european parliament in remind be the
i am the agree agree that the union democratic and more must be and closer the the citizens must to to are with a number proposals am i the however not agree because i they to little supervisory think
therefore i i i abstained
the the important area the the institutions the in the resolution a satisfactory solution proposed
the clear confirmation the the principle the the double  the the union by the peoples and by the states is in that respect very important
they makes the for the negotiators the the smallest member possible in nice the principle the a sufficient representation in all institutions with including the the european parliament to defend
the the still more that with the opening the the debate on the proportionality the the vote in the council and the seats in the european parliament and therefore on the power between the member a pandora the pandora is opened the in nice difficult will can be closed
not only between the large and the small member but also between the large member between the now 
the european council would there therefore good the do immediately all institutional decisions according the principle the the double legitimacy that from the beginning the the community are gentlemen has proven to take
i support the ambition to the the summit the nice the enlargement to simplify
the joint resolution the however a series wordings in where i not behind can are
i am against the develop the a common defence and the introduce the a council the highlighted
i can a vote with a qualified majority within the trade not support and i nor behind decisions the with a qualified majority be taken under the second pillar that like say the foreign security and defence
the is wrong to the union the to parts in  and  therefore am i the there not that agree that a third part the the member priority the
the is also wrong to the charter the to take in the treaty
brok a
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen we have not only to content reasons against the reports the the mr brok and mrs lalumière voted but also because we always have issues that the common foreign and security which they the have a utopia is as eight year after the treaty the maastricht is have
the way the  refer i to article j member the title v the the treaty the maastricht the member to there concern for that their national policy with the common positions line
that article is not few time in eight taken not more moreover than the other articles the title v contrary the was with being into
the most recent example of is the recognition the north by london
the presidentinoffice president the the union  this shortly the he an mentioned three days later followed berlin the example the london apparently without even the effort to have taken to the french presidency the the informed to to
we have us here completely business made for this  european integration or perhaps can we better european disintegration say is that end only a failure to more
i think example the the reform the the institutions the for and then for was promised and the few days for the summit the nice still still inappropriate seems to are
the summit the nice will not more are than a next disappointment in the with the enlargement the also already since ten year the promised i one than still on the successive inauguration in the with the euro
that are but few examples
i would the also on the reduction the the appropriations for the meda and the european development can have
one thing must we from this reports abstained the almost catch call to the nato because for can the mr brok only kosovo mention
in washington have the europeans this time a judge found and thanks the  the the american generals has europe last a unity found
again this is all business if the  the history the europe in the st century will write think i that they the not more on the cfsp will have than on the  and that is perhaps but the best also
mrs the president i i with pleasure for the brok voted on this report like i you the comments the a old retired pass
are name is his  and he is from the town  san  in the province bergamo
when i him his that the european union on its own safety and defence start after to think said he good as
i i in the last war fought and that is i absolutely not points if the you therefore manage wars to prevent as you to still to have done have you a very important objective achieved
then has he still said while i in the war  i i not work and therefore not contributions for my pension paid
the  that i me is as low as terrible low
but wages the wars fact the
we welcome and support the report that many important trends deals in the development the the common foreign and security
we are the however not agree with the fact that the task the carried the by the high representative transferred the the the commission
we can us there nor in find that the delegations the the union in eu change
the member are responsible for diplomacy with the abroad
we are the opinion that a conversion the the delegations the the commission in delegations the the union to  can lead with the national diplomatic delegations the the member
earlier this year i i the mr solana enthusiastic hear tell that there outside the territory the the european union many areas there where can be action
are new role has a end made the the traditional neutrality the ireland sweden finland and austria
after was under defence what that the the own territory defends against foreign attackers
a secularise army had therefore not tasks outside the territory the the the the that army has up
the nato has the the first year the its there taken the the formula
the army the the united states drew vietnam the  republic and  within while france and england the  in hands did to to but if nato was there not in outside the own territory
that was only after the soviet and the warsaw the years the justify were been for the there the the nato were has
my party the socialist party the netherlands the any attempt the the european union to the power america to can the
i can not agree with the intentions the the mr brok has with are report
the delegation the laudace  europe the the group union for a europe the national states has without hesitate against the report the the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence voted that the mr brok here has defended
as each year the in this catch report the the european parliament that in principle the annual balance the the cfsp the the familiar gradual method applied which the tried the any federalist breakthrough the a the area use to make to still further to to without with the treaties or decisions the the european councils account to the
in this case the the the council the helsinki and the common foreign policy which the rapporteur three principle objectives preparing the we only but can reject the european activity in the world to to the the the union a really european prosecutor the foreign affairs up to the functions the the national ministries on to take and finally the structure the the european union give and the community method countries by in the particularly the high representative under the responsibility the the commission to places
in this action on the structures the only a only however very important element forget namely the previous definition and content the a common foreign policy
the diplomatic reality from strong the what some in the parliament dream the cfsp there not
if that still need was was that recently proven by the recognition without a common position the to wait the the republic north by the united kingdom and germany
the is therefore clear that we the weight the the european diplomacy can increase by to try the decisions the in being the privilege the the national states continue to harmonise if that desirable appropriate and effective is and not by total unmotivated structural restrictions the to to
our group has therefore again against the absurd proposals voted to the national diplomatic services to the community level on to transfer as in the paragraphs and the the resolution the to the delegations the the union in real european embassies to to forms and to a european school for diplomacy the to up
the proposal to already the diplomatic staff the the member to estimated officials the serving to to the a imagined foreign policy is already just  if specific
the brok contains many points which the british conservative members the the parliament in can vote especially with the emphasis the the the the the enlargement the the union
there are however a number specific elements the we not can support example
that the commission the responsibility for the security and defence the the must to take by the postal the high representative for the cfsp on to take paragraphs and
that delegations the the commission the role the eu the the must to take and that they the work the embassies the the member must to coordinate paragraph
a autonomous security and defence outside the nato to paragraphs to
the suggestion the military intervene by the european union in asia paragraph
report a
mrs the president previous week was i in rome
i i a nepotism the son the my point the the the  in the united states has learnt  to administrations he has are training completed therefore he can now the the work if pilot in the military aviation
he has the i heard that the european union a rapid force the the up is a army that quickly can action to the peace in europe and in the every region programmes to maintain expect this would i like the part has he said
but that is not the reason that i him mention course
if he good is is he there the i mention him because he later in us discussion has said that is a good idea that european army and also the european police
why would we armies must the to the borders between italy france germany and spain to defend the are there however not more
the armies infamous is a good idea
the five danish liberal members the the european parliament vote for the report on the common security and defence because we the  the the eu and therefore also the the nato want strengthen
this new cooperation will only successful are if both the eu if the nato there strengthened it
the danish social in the european parliament support the report on the creating the a common european security and defence
the report contains however few elements the we not without more can support
the first is the important the to to that denmark the on the the reservations the military area not forces can make for the common european force
the second are we sceptical the the idea on a really european  if the the the in europe same  if in the usa the to to
for research and  has a common european  however the benefits to offer
the third the in the report the different places favour for a active role the the european parliament the the creating the a common european security and defence
we stress that the the the a such policy a intergovernmental matter is which the european parliament not can or must be involved
the further institutionalisation the the security and defence in the eu is a development the we not can support
any member must itself can decide in what he the a common european security and defence like participate
the is moreover not the task the the european parliament to defining how large the force must are and or there both relief if  must to are
we find the sense member the not the a certain operation want participate to force that to pay as the european parliament proposed because the countries in issue than involved be the a conflict which they nothing to make want have
to same reason is the also important the neutral member not for the head to any
their wish to neutral to are must in all respects respected be
we have course against the report voted
under the pretext the the development the a european security and defence declared the rapporteur clearly that a military policy the serving the the objectives the the foreign policy the the european union essential is the is therefore to the interests the imperialist powers and large capitalist groups the europe control and the direction the the union determine
we are more to more against that imperialist military regime opposed because here on a expressed consensus there the majority majority the the groups the right through the greens to the group the clear behind the policy
that policy is course against the peoples at the is at against them the under imperialist military interventions the the union and its allies to suffering would have as recently in the balkans
the is however also at against the peoples the the european union the in each case the new in the report requested  must finance and even not certainly know or the troops in name the the order the a day not against them will be used
measure europe must also a political union be and not only a economic
therefore are also the italian communists champion the a rapid accession the the countries for the achieve the a greater europe with if basis the european culture and the best democratic traditions
the this area are all contradictions between western and central and eastern overcome now must also the military organisation the the nato the as gradually completely from the time is be leave the favour the a european army that independent is the the united states
the european army must fully european are effective and effective and must under democratic monitoring the the parliamentary institutions are
if there a such army was been than would the war the the nato against yugoslavia given the history and the traditions the the participating peoples not have place
therefore vote we for the report although we many reservations and comments have on the aggressive nature the some parts the the resolution we will ensure fight to the aggression to prevent
to under more the next reasons have we against the report voted

we are the opinion that there today the day not real threats for europe there the is other high time for a active disarmament and enlargement the civil resources
we are that convinced that a peaceful europe not to the can to by means the military alliances
the future conflicts be not resolved by military intervene but by means the a social economic and ecological fair policy
us peace is based the the  according what militarisation not for a safer and uganda world the but contributes the a greater insecurity and a greater risk the military conflicts

we are the opinion that a civil crisis a valuable instrument is for prevention something where in the report unfortunately not sufficient attention the the paid

we are the opinion that military actions in the framework the the common security and defence only carried should be after and in agreement with resolutions the the security a way the the rapporteur not seems to parts

the report is based the a  where we not in believe
we find that the international right and the sovereignty the the national states respected must to be and if guiding must must in the international political
there the about on the common interests and standards and values the the eu if reason for military when
we are the opinion that there not reasons there for a militarisation the on the this standards and values the not be defined and which we us ask what they content

mrs lalumière the clear the that we in the future within the eu possible compulsory will are to all borders with third countries the the eu to defend
that is not together with the nonallied the a number member

further the neutrality all not mentioned in the report and in the justification the the report suspicion we a lack the respect the countries the neutral are
in paragraph be member compulsory the not want or can participate the a task to however that to do and the task to finance
this is nor compatible with neutrality

the idea the a comprehensive defence find we a insult the the countries the now already a odds economy have and the fact must invest in example social prosperity in place the in when
pt this report is particularly worrying
the approval that means that the european parliament are support its the a closer militarisation the the european union the initiative join the the the objective to latest in a rapid force the established to to the any the within days the the mislead the can be for a year available are and the necessary support from the air and the sea received
the urges the the the further development the the military resources and capabilities the the european union and line the member to the the this areas in the existing gaps to for as they recently the the area the the strategic air  and  and  have done
a another worrying point is the proposal to the member the not the a certain mission want participate to to force a financial contribution to make the on the the the war participating member the divided
we parts also no the pleased on the framework the six european countries in  have closed order the restructuring the the industry in europe to promote the the a loss policy down that the civil and military aspects the the use the the area and the available national and multinationals military resources includes
to finally makes the report reference the the possibility that in nice the final bodies the the cfsp military committee and military staff be up the powers and the  the this bodies will the implementation the the common security and defence still up
therefore can we only but against
if the the summit the nice to the up the the core the a european army the decided the the confirmed that a european power in the life will be established the its interests all in the world will defend
that shows the imperialist nature the the power the is because to the protection the investment in the abroad the conquest the markets the access to materials and the exploitation the cheap work
in the framework the the nato will the force together with the united states in action to
in the first place will the european army be used to the immediate environment the the european union to stabilise
the  the eastern and africa the the area the the trade can the social inequality only but strengthen and will to social  local military conflicts and massive those lead
in the future will the european union by its diplomatic and military forces to coordinate with more success try to do what the member during the whole over century have done and that all under the pretext the the conservation the the peace and the humanitarian operations
we have not need the a 
just if against the nato and us own national army are we against the european army opposed
if we to the united states the challenge the to to our european military industry    want develop will the first result of a drastic increase the the military budget and the communitisation the the scientific and technological research to the military sector are
the this new imperialist plan the the european union have the workers nothing to win but everything to lose
in my vote the the brok i i indicated that i the action the armies the member the the european union outside the own territory not see if a contribution the defence or safety
the  there the the nato was celebrated with the first 
the war proposed milosevic in the to still a year longer to continue govern on serbia and montenegro because he was the the opportunity to the the to throw if the best guarantee for the serbs against foreign aggression
the rapporteur as now a number reasons to outside the own territory the to act one of is the justified indignation on ethnic conflicts outside the union
the is good that we us the deal in the form the conciliation the propose the models for administrative solutions and the to the humanitarian support the those the the if result the as such conflict must feel to to to move
with military resources the outside is there not solution because the the the cause the the conflict not way and change the public opinion not
the fear that  not for the member available to can already at not universally reason are for unilaterally intervene
i i against the report voted
the the many points in the report where i critical the i like i the next examples discuss
paragraph calls in any case that a member the not the a task wishes part to take in name the the solidarity between the member taken is a financial contribution to make the on the participating member the divided
paragraph is finally the opinion that the tasks end from the general budget the the european communities paid must be what a amendment the article treaty and the the financial perspectives necessary will make
this paragraphs to i i as far that the difficult the to the right to maintain the neutral countries as sweden the autonomous decisionmaking within the defence and the right to not involved to be the a armed conflict
the wordings in the report to therefore to far and are therefore sufficient reason to against the report in are whole to vote
i welcome the attempt to the develop the a common european security but i am against the development the a common military defence
the report contains example farreaching wordings on the cfsp and the nato on risk with the use the violence if pressure the prevention what directly in fight is with the charter
same applies for the wordings on the improve the the ability the the eu to hostile  to  and for wordings on a  and wordings on reinforced cooperation what the a mutual 
therefore can i the report not support
i support the report in large lines but i like say that i a from opinion i on paragraph
the the called that member the not the a task wish part to take taken are given the solidarity between the member a financial contribution to make the on the participating member the divided
a such demand the to my opinion to far
 a and lalumière a
we have to different reasons against the  and lalumière voted
we find that when and the corresponding increase the the military expenditure not answer the the challenges the europe now must into
in this decade after the changes in the east to the countries with this reports a wrong signal on the european peace
the second can the report the give to a divide with the nonaligned countries the involved be in the common european security and defence that they that must finance
the  unity in diversity seems to dissenting especially for the nonaligned member also in the case only a part the the content the the reports the implement the the
the introduction the a new territorial defence that also in the future to the competence the a vicepresident the the commission would properly can we nor support
a such divide with the nato only to the borders the europe to  the far the the  words after the fall the the wall
we have absolutely not need the still more military structures
the were other good for the image the the eu that they the would concentrate the civil and humanitarian solutions in place the the tasks all priority to to
 a
mrs the president i i for this measure voted because i think that all attempts to peace to means especially in areas where civil and social conflicts battles by the party the the pensioners supported must be
a critical comment for mrs theorin under the many proposals the they has tabled to women more influence to give the consultations in zones there a proposal to women the to take in the higher rung the the 
mrs the president you the us gestured european parliament as skilled in control you would the also in the are a h to lead the missions in zones the the way would also you the the positive influence the women the the peace contribute
the the was the idea the the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities to a report the to to on the participation the women the peaceful consultations acceptable
what the however from the bus is has is fact a type  only little the what in the  page long resolution the has really something to make with this issue
there are references to documents statements agreements resolutions the the un and the security and plans the are hundreds pages involved which the scope many the us not agree can out
the resolution there from considerations and paragraphs with paragraph programmes
in  six paragraphs the something that to make has with the actual issue
the rest is  with comments on violence sexual conduct the european soldiers during missions on the serbs the with not floor reference added and  the  in camps demands on the asylum and immigration abortion age to gender  analyses the up the ministries for winning in the member etc
a teacher would the the assessment the a such drawing say not this 
i can not agree with a such heterogeneous which matter abuse the made the a issue to us certain ideological demands the regard the the just mentioned issues the to you
i the i now already clarified because i know that i with my voice will be as if a movement the the participation the women the peaceful consultations
i am this however not movement the contrary
writing
and i am the agree with the report the my mr majbritt theorin
as they in the text clear makes be during armed conflicts sexual violence and massive rape the women systematically if from used
also support i its call the the member to already the necessary steps to take to article the the fourth protocol the geneva to change so rape forced exalted and sexual slavery be defined if war
also support i its call for the ratification the the treaty the rome with the to the international criminal
the rapporteur must also be supported in its call the the commission and the member to the the organisation the camps the by the european union be financed and the their asylum and immigration account to the with  there can example asylum be granted the women the during a armed conflict are there
we support the report in large lines but we have effort with the  in some parts that because the in fight is with the subsidiarity the this reflected in us vote
the report is also further than are original task as that from the title that
many problems the in the report be discussed are in high extent real but hear not home in this document
writing
and in the report prevention and solution the armed conflicts  seeks mrs theorin the reader the the informed to to the the role the women in peaceful consultations
fact is this quite confusion because the title the the report vote not fully line with the content
a number provisions including the penalties the  the such schemes the camps that they safe are for women and ensure that women in difficult circumstances enough food and medical resources to their available have are certainly good
but the content the the document is still many further
unfortunately enough has the report clear to objective to the international  saying to it or even to  the abortion ban the to penalties or to suppress
this failed objective is in fight with the constitution the my country ireland and is without only doubt also in fight with the  in other countries the abortion not want encourage but precisely reduce
also already recognise and support i the participation the women in peaceful consultations fully however see i myself unfortunately must to against this quite confused report vote
limitations a
the only positive the this report is that the the a european definition the domestic work and a clear reduction the the maximum number hours the the
the report the were the domestic staff but the the especially with the interests the their employers are that would not  are if the only to a minority the the employers would to namely to elderly the only live and  need have
the needs the this group be however only but the to us the tax  the administrative services and the adaptation the the tariffs and costs the the financial opportunities the the private in the embarrassment to separate
if that the adopted will that the especially rich families possible make their administrative expenditure with money the the community to let subsidising
additional cynical is that in the explanatory the domestic staff responsible the the for the fact that their employers them black let work
of the few basic rights the in the report are included vote we not against but also not before the report
we vote against this report on the socalled domestic work
the introduce the this type models the under other in belgium and denmark sometimes new market be mentioned the clearly the the in the the the a lower  the mainly from native there but also from men and longterm unemployed
to a such market with through the tax incentives to encourage is us i quite
the taxes must the a other way used be example to people the opportunity to give the to develop and their choice in their life to give
the problems the be discussed in the report can be resolved by means the a humane asylum and policy by work as to organise that there a balance the between work and free time and by a based social responsibility for people with special needs
thousands women in the european union would welcome are if we us here were deal with the legal regulation the illegal domestic work if they the but knew
the benefit the this report is doubt that the there
i am however not very welcome with few wordings the
in my country luxembourg situation we in a normal situation and make we not distinction between workers in the small sector or they now in the industry or in the parity working are
they have the right the the legal minimum and the participation the the ranging accidents and insurance
with other words they be not against the relation the other workers
that is course a almost ideal situation if i least the proposals in the report read for possible derogations
i see example not in why the  the a administrative aid a atypical relationship must are
the is however to ride to from to are that we in the st century the member still must recommend administrative  right to give the social insurance and appropriate pension
for i can the nor by the unacceptable that called the the national level the domestic work the prices and costs the to apply the the financial opportunities the the private
the demand to simplification the the administrative formalities is other the sense
in luxembourg have we in the framework the the national released already decided a such simplification by to to
that work also good and is a model that i in all modesty also others the i like recommend
also the demand payments for administrative performance deductible to make the the tax is the good on from the can the the difference reduce between undeclared and examination workers
the national governments must here strong and generously are so workers and employers be encouraged the to the with work
i like also warn against the to the a permits the women immigrants
the awareness the the deal with women will the in the hands  and course all women the illegal in the eu be  give if  in the housekeeping
want we that
i thought the not
therefore must we careful are with such changes this can abuse the be made
we have against the limitations voted on the normal the domestic work
the rapporteur is the opinion that there the european level a legal framework need is that the possible makes that people the administrative services offer under a legislation for  the
mrs smet the under other the introduction for the a european definition the domestic work
also like the rapporteur that the member fund for domestic work introduce so the difference between the costs for black and white work smaller the
there is many question to domestic work
by the high taxes in both sweden if the other eu meet question and supply other not the the constituency market
the income social contributions and vat introducing the  the to levels the almost not only parity with a normal income prepared is to pay
as good if already the domestic work that against payment the carried is currently black work
the this market are many women and young people working
they have not rights they are not assured they build not pension the they have not right the on and have not social security
for to many young people is black work their first contact with the market
the is very regrettable that by unreasonable tax people the this way be forced to black to work
therefore are we the agree with the rapporteur that the difference between the costs for black and white work smaller must be and we are the opinion that the member a taxes the domestic work must introduce
people the domestic work out are the this way assured can a pension build have right the on and social security
other are we that against that there the european level a detailed legal framework for domestic work the introduced
because we find that this issues the national regional or local level must to be dealt vote we against the report
the is good that mrs smet our attention drawing the the weak legal the administrative aides the black work
mrs smet asking to a european definition the the understanding domestic work also request they the member to statistics with the to black domestic work the to to and regular the the events the to apply
they like that domestic work if a full appeal the as also asking they to a european law and legislation on the rights the this workers this the this at their legal still per country from
mrs smet the also the that the the drafting the rules and laws with the to work account must to be taken with the working and  the domestic workers
also stressed they the important to in all member the principle by to to that rules that any agreement the timelimits also stressed they that both employers if workers must be information on their rights and duties with the to agreements
finally request they the member to the issue the visas for domestic staff the diplomats to link the minimum conditions
we must this report carefully in recital to take
 has a long history the bad payment bad working a bad legal and sexual intimidation
that is still more the case if the is to work the poor women in the households the the rich
that work the often informal regulated without trade works  and collective agreement
the worker the not or hardly protected and is in many cases largely on the the arbitrary the the employer
the worst the the if the also still agree is to women from far countries the this work from need have accepted and the not other possibility have to in their living to continue for
the is a immigrants the in our still still strong by men dominance world often the forget
any can aware that there abuses possible are but many are inclined to the extent the the abuses and the consequences for the involved strong to underestimate
this report is a useful result the the there the the commission for the rights the the women and equal opportunities
the pursued discussions with involved organisations and the up the the problems remind the  on the position the workers the more than a century ago
although my group the report to limited take and the conclusions to modest forms they the a sensible the to steps in the good direction
we are positive the the idea to domestic work to into in the market but we have effort with the  the eu in some parts the the report this are in fight with the subsidiarity
the report is also further than are original task as that from the title that
 a
mrs the president i will not abuse make the your time to from to to why i for the  i voted but i must the say that the for elderly and pensioners very important is to know how the resources the the european union be spent how they be use by the administration the the commission
pensioners in very europe have namely the den who had what the means if money bad the managed
they have the national governments their contributions paid and the have if  pension their money  in the nothing do disappear
i would not want that president prodi if as such  government a modern european government the would succeed the money the all european citizens to do disappear
i say the but that does he the not but however like i that point from name the the pensioners
in march force the commission after different scandals and  the
that resignation after a long  must us however not do forget that the delors a cost responsibility take than the next commission
after that resignation imposed by the elected representatives the the european nations was that a indepth reform the the methods the the different directoratesgeneral the the commission the the decisionmaking and the the structures essential was to the available resources for the management the the income and the community policy better to use
despite the heavy shortcomings in the past will the group union for a europe the national states not a priori criticism the the commission and the reform of make
the is however clear that the reform in the first place must must to the rightly strong violating confidence the the public opinion in the european institutions to restore and that as in the report the by a considerable improvement the performance and efficiency but also by a transparent method
the commission must therefore during the whole duration the the programme regular report produce also the  the in december the expect is therefore important
the the the the  budget requires as you know a amendment the the financial rules which article provides in a separation between the administrative appropriations part a and the operational appropriations part b the commission will therefore good must careful to the powers the the parliament with the to the allocation the appropriations not the to really
the french delegation will the course against the application the the codecision for a amendment the the financial rules oppose
by the to insist the the dismantling the the bat programmes to the responsibility the the commission for the implementation the the programme programmes to strengthen has the parliament the commission clear want make that only the tasks the not the the with the public service through  contracts the the private sector can be externalising
what the comitology the  the group union for a europe the national states the federalist vision in the report which the they that the member through the administration and  the  the the commission weaken and their being the that they in this committees national interests defend the sometimes contrary are with the interests the the community
the rapporteur is even the opinion that the reform the the commission to benefit must be taken to the action the the committees to to to areas which not expenditure involved are
the community policy must the expression are the the pragmatic agreements between the countries the the union
we find that the member in the particularly given the the general bureaucratic certain and the scandals and  the the recent past precisely more than ever the the decisionmaking must be involved
the like the rapporteur to their influence from to decided is in that respect very enlightening
the proposals the the commission in the framework the the reform do also a number questions in the with the staff questions
i will the on only a the the questions have approximately officials less than the the staff would early must horizons
the services the the commission say us that this decision not only effect the the budget will have
our group hopes that this where is but that is not sufficient in the particularly must that be ensure that the reevaluation provisions in eight be taken and that the measures the other priorities the the reform not measures and not the are for political had
also is general know that certain nationalities clear overrepresented are in the subordinate degrees the categories c and d to the hidden budgetary reason that the involved staff the  the not the
the discriminatory practices are unacceptable
in already our countries is there unemployment the commission would there good the do the the early retirement and the unearned the hundreds new officials use to make to item the affairs to to
the same way must doubt and put be the the the tolerance and the certain in the services the the commission in the particularly what the unearned the temporary staff the
finally the the group for a europe the national states that that the citizens the the european union more than ever expect that the the reform and unearned account will be taken with the diversity the opinions and convictions in our countries
rate ruiz a
mrs the president i i for the rate ruiz voted
the is the the the important that the budgets and the expenditure for the activities the the commission can be controlled
i i however especially for voted because i like would want and that like i in this parliament to the to that we the the control the the accounts therefore the control how the money the the commission is spent not only the figures control four plus four is eight eight plus eight is sixteen sixteen plus sixteen is   plus  is 
addition the figures must also that be controlled
in a still recent past have different scandals and  led to the resignation the the commission in march
that resignation has clear made that a indepth reform the the structures and procedures but also the the methods the the services the the commission essential was to the resources in the community policy optimum to use
the proposals in the paper are largely motivated by the second report the the committee the independent experts and must the commission in the to for a structure and optimum methods to ensure to the as good possible the the its by the treaty allocated tasks to doing the must they however its also in the treaty established infinitum not to outside to as in the past to often is happened
the on the the rights and powers the the by the treaty are granted must the european parliament the commission carefully control in the particularly what the transparency and the implementation the the budget the the european union the
the citizens the our fifteen countries the their representatives choose would there not understanding for have if we that not would do the is because to their money
the success the the in the paper proposed reform will be assessed the the hand the the results the the area the the use the the human and financial resources through a effective monitoring mechanisms and appropriate sanctions
what the conduct in the political life the welcome the group union for a europe the independent states the codes for the relations between the members the the commission and between the services the the commission and the public the condition course that the texts a legal have
the payment the the commission is often justification
the is than also important that this as quickly possible something the done the due sums must more be paid
the situation contrary because the force the all european institutions the community policy the moral and financial obligations the our citizens and the citizens the third countries in
we must there therefore for ensure that the obligations many better be observed than in the past the case was
what the staff the must the merit the the officials and a many greater transparency the the area the policy in the general the strong points the the new administrative reform be
the group union for a europe the national states welcome in principle the answer the the paper the the commission the the request the the parliament to its policy carefully to reform
the group union for a europe the national states the there therefore the that the reform the the commission there the the area the the unearned the staff to must lead that more attention the spent the the different opinions and convictions in our countries with the to the past and the future the europe
the citizens the our respective countries would there not understanding for have if that not would done
also the the certain and the nepotism the  in the particularly the temporary staff must doubt and put be the
the group union for a europe the national states is in this stage in principle not against the early retirement the different hundreds officials the condition that the reevaluation provisions in eight be taken that the early retirement the priorities the the reform not  that they not budgetary consequences has that they in the important the the service and the voluntary basis happening and not the is for political had
finally i i that that we expect that this for the future necessary reform same for more care and transparency in the daily policy the the commission will ensure and the commission within the framework the its powers also a more responsibility will give
 a
mrs the president the mr harbour the the in this report mainly are with the staff the the commission their salary their career and also their pension
now would the commission agree must let see that they the contributions the its workers good can manage
as the page the the  the must there be why the a fund
we have the example the the fund the the european parliament that by our administrators as excellent the managed they have the contributions the the members as good sectors that the benefits the the pensioner members recently are increased
let we for the workers the the commission and then for all citizens the the european union also as to work to
 a
i i for the  voted that in essentially is on the institutional aspects the the reform the the commission
in this vote like i with emphasis repeat that us parliament unfortunately not all powers has the the would must have
i i still never someone hear proposals that the initiative only the the parliament reserved would must are in place the the the commission and the parliament together
that is a amendment the i useful and important seems and not difficult to achieve
the commission must decisions out they must the executive power the the european union are and the parliament the legislative power
also in the european parliament must there a separation the powers are as the the french revolution was the
writing
and the british conservative members vote against this report because the already often concerns opposition against the enlargement the the vote with qualified majority we vote there also not that in that the fundamental in the treaty be included
the british conservatives support the initiative the the level the the strict coordination because this in agreement is with the view that the electronic vote more must to has
the conservatives vote also in with the statement the the given in paragraph the the report that the democratic control must to be guarantee and that the system the the three pillars in force must be the
that the approval the the parliament is requires to the procedure in force to to applies only if the unanimity the lifted
 pérez del arco a
mrs the president we have us the this vote abstained
i like this however something on explain because by disease was i prevented to in strasbourg the the last discussions part to take
we have not for voted because we think that the development within the commission still still too given the if a palliative
if i also in the documents the the commission read that the integration in the neighbours world for the poor countries the essentially is than fear i that the over is the the fact that the globalisation by us the behind by the western economies and that we than also what we if first point as namely the poverty that we that fact not seriously do because that we often the person are the the poverty the we then want combat
i i not against this report voted because the a number  affairs the and because i a strong political wish
i am a favour the the conservation the a common development the the level the the european union but i fear that the reform if they not good process this people will feed the fact the programmes all again want renationalising
according i has the parliament here the opportunity missed to the a serious way the to to the the analysis the the mistakes and we had also many more time must to the a clear analysis the the  the the commission proposed
i regret this and therefore have we us also if group abstained because we think that the ngos here bad it
the way the point the item like i conclude
i i now all judge heard on the vote the my colleagues on all possible issues and therefore i i i  to your  somewhat to ignore because i thought that the a little excessive was if you here special remains to on everything still agree you opinion to say although we the course all the have
mrs the president this is the thirteenth and last vote the the party the the pensioners today november from this vote has the the the report on development where i for i voted
but i like the here in this sitting the the european parliament to brussels the just loud and clear say if we european money spend to the poor and less  in developing to support must we also decisions to a european ambassador in this countries to them the control can exercise the the spending the that money
that is the setup important
the vote is closed
adjournment the the session
i declare the session the the european parliament to are cut
the sitting the to at closed
resumption the the session
i declare the session the the european parliament the the november was cut to are resumed
regulation the the work
the the item is the treatment the the final agenda as this the thursday december accordance article the the rules is up by the conference the presidents
tuesday
mrs the president the the first place like i with your if the personal title although i think the opinion the the majority the the sitting to echoing and not only the the my group let know that i the fully agree am with your statement the the announcement the the charter the the fundamental
i think that you there rightly the has out that for the parliament the charter constitutional gentlemen has and therefore like i you with your statement congratulate
the the second place mrs the president would i you want questions the parliament clarity to provide on the way which the debate with the french presidency on the european council the nice the structured and the what basis the presidentinoffice president the the council the the debate will participate i question you to more clarity this there in the during the the day many contradictory reports the round have done
applause
indeed mr barón barón the reports are contradictory
as you will understand is the reason this probably that against everyone expected in the summit only last night was concludes
i will try clarification to obtain
i was before the summit told that the president the the republic together with the minister the foreign affairs present would are
that was what i said was but i will see or i suppress news can obtain and i will your message pass
mrs the president i am very grateful for your efforts
we have heard and i like there immediately the add that i the not can believe that the french president the also the president the the council is tomorrow but minutes here remains for are speech
perhaps listening he still to romano prodi that know i not but he would than not more hear what the group to say have
if that where is would i that unacceptable find the most members the my group see that also as
i am welcome that the other groups the with i agree are
i hope that this information not true i request you however to the french president to tell that the completely unacceptable is if he only but to the parliament is to a speech to the and than again report without to have listened to the elected representatives the the citizens the europe
applause
mrs the president i am the the i with this comments agree
i would like want that you the french presidency the position the my own group send namely a draft that the worth is to expressed to be must the also worth are to defended to be
mrs the president there does the a problem for with the possible presentation the a resolution on the european council the nice
my group is the opinion that the conference the presidents this not only decision has taken and that the debate therefore without resolution must be concluded
i would this like by you confirmed want see
you wishes therefore not resolution
that is not the wish the the socialist group
there was not agreement achieved in the conference the presidents and therefore had the decided to wait
this point like i like clarify see
good that you that says because as you know could i the way the exception not participate the the conference the presidents because i exactly the same at the the european council present was
mrs the president we been partially in same sitting
also i was not present during the conference the group
the mr ingo ingo is as kind been to us to represent
for far we know must we here decisions or we a resolution want
our group is the opinion that we now a very short text want not final position but a short political assessment without final yes or no to say also already because we the texts still at not have
later must we the result very length assess
that means that we according our group this week a short text must deal without the term for a political response to let expiry
as see we that
mrs the president i aware how difficult the for the european parliament is to a judgement to do on the summit the nice since we still not on the texts have
according i is the than also excluded that we a carefully and good motivated position can adopt
hand the us parliament often being that the behind the facts the assumptions and therefore would the unfortunately are if we nothing would say
i am the than also with the mr poettering agree we would the thursday on a short resolution can vote and the a political signal can give after this summit
mrs the president during the european council the nice are there two types resolutions the the item been on issues the we in the parliament dealt have the the one on have we issues if the statute the the european company the agenda for the social policy the safety the sea and the mad cows
on already this issues has the council resolutions approved the we time received have and therefore can assess
this we us on the delicate affairs therefore not believe have can forms believe we that there on the results the the conference not resolution must be tabled we can the namely only a provisional response give the characterised will are by a what better or worse  but we consider such response not the are place
fact also to a short resolution to can up must the the issue very good know
we believe therefore mrs the president that the the caution witness not few resolution in to must and the commission constitutional affairs to questions a report for to prepare on the content on the the issue that to due time with knowledge the affairs can be discussed
mrs the president no underestimated the important and the scope the this summit the also the enumerations in the history the the european union is become
therefore are we us precisely also in a difficult position this is a important summit and we must our words therefore carefully roads
i think however that the a secondclass solution is to as the mr poettering proposed in rush because this is the in fact the the a short resolution in other to such
i am therefore for postponement the the resolution to january
we can then speak on the way which we this resolution to submit in the form the a report the the commission constitutional affairs or if a own initiative i am in any case for postponement the the resolution to january
mrs the president the summit the nice is very important
this the all comment the made and that comment the broad get in the press
therefore is the for i unthinkable that the european parliament that note less unequivocally the the day after the summit there the silence to does
i i you therefore for mrs the president to let vote on two alternatives or we say now already something on the treaty the nice that something otherwise is than the summit or we to with the need formula a content comment from to the partsession the january
let we here in any case on vote i am favour the the solution the by the gentlemen poettering lannoye and others was proposed
mrs the president in my group was the most the opinion that we our vision not through a resolution express must make
partly because we not enough opportunity have had to agreed after to think but also because we the wrong find to to to that the parliament the a important debate not with a opinion is
i think that the parliament tomorrow are vision strong will europe even without resolution
i believe therefore not that the will think that we our mouths taken have i think that the this later very otherwise on will think
mrs the president this parliament deals resolutions on all problems all the world if something however really urgent is namely a response the the summit the nice than hesitate we
who that understand must i that but agree explain
the electorate will the not understand
we have already many resolutions adopted the the colleagues at not read had
we are however hope in the to a parliamentary debate to to on texts the already months know are which we the content the scope and the historic important know
i consider the if our duty the the their to this a opinion to give
applause
mrs the president the commission constitutional affairs must a certainly report prepare only than can the european parliament are final position determine that than also binding is and if message can must for other parliaments which we know that they the the message wait
the the other on wait the citizens the europe the our opinion
that not not yes or no against the treaty are but the a critical assessment the the events in nice otherwise disappear we the this political stage
we must next week a contribution make the this discussion and critical or perhaps also positive arguments propose without this immediately already a conclusion the to link
that is the only way
therefore are the proposals the the gentlemen poettering and dellalba sensible also apply they the best the our role
mrs the president few speakers have referred to a possible task for the commission constitutional affairs
i must that point that our commission tomorrow unequivocally to before everything good try to understand to what conclusions the intergovernmental conference is has
we will us than to the representative the the commission can use to the him information to to on the text the the draft which we far not have
we have just heard that the text the this at still not available is perhaps will he there in the next hours are
course i i not in the the political judge on the conclusions the group would possibly their position in the form the a resolution to expression can to
than must the the course the agree be on what what the under political conclusions and that seems i not as simple
i like only a only example give the the content judge
yourself mrs the president know that there to night different versions were the a essential point namely the enlargement the the votes with qualified majority and the recognition the the codecision the the parliament
the last night is there still the the texts work as the the distribution the the vote in the council and the the seats in the parliament
certainly what the the commission have we need the further information and reflection
mrs the president after nice be we here with a important choice faced we should us on the formal question or there now the or not resolution must to not against other let up
the question is not important enough
directly after the events in nice is the precisely that we if parliament still this week a clear noise let hear
that can we in a debate do as the mr cox has proposed
in this parliament is the however usual to the a such subject a resolution to turn
i i good listened to the words the the gentlemen poettering brok and others they want only a first position determine
the is not the intention already a position the the parliament to determine
applause
we want say that we that only will do after ready decided in the commission constitutional affairs
that will in the next one or two months done
than determine we us position yes no or perhaps as do we that always
in that case would i after consultation with my chairman can agree with a such resolution this week
on would we the agree can be we would can say that we a position determine but that we us final position only the basis the the report the our commission can drafting
applause
i thank you for your constructive contribution mr hänsch
the parliament is agreement with the proposal
wednesday
the president
i i a request the the ppede to postponement to the partsession the january the the report the the mr the de on assessment and control the 
who like the floor to the support the this request
mrs the president the december have we this voted
the is a extremely complicated report and under more the amendments and are the a rather controversial vote approved
we are the opinion that this report further examination require and therefore questions we there in january on to debate and to vote
is there someone the the floor wishes to to against this request
mrs the president during the treatment in the commission are we that based that this debate in january place would must find
the is finally a second reading
the this at find there still discussions place between the council and the european parliament perhaps the the conciliation the unnecessary
therefore seems the i sensible to the term possibly to extended and the welcome only in january to deal
like someone the floor to against this request to postponement
obviously not than late i this vote
the parliament gave the request in
mrs the president with the view the this decision and given the fact that commissioner liikanen not the thursday but the the wednesday present will can are question i i the or the report the mrs  on the european digital content postponing can be the thursday to wednesday to the gap that is the by the example the the recommendation for the second reading the the welcome the to complement
i would the very the price to if you this request would want accede
mrs the president i would this like want postpone to january if that possible is because commissioner fischler here not present can are because 
the is very important that he the the discuss the this report present is because the are strong interest has and we for the success that in high extent on are the the commission
i request the parliament the discuss from to to to january
mrs the president while the the summit the nice a debate way was on the enlargement has the french government italian young the wanted participate the the  the only off and in  blocked
this is a attack the the free movement the on the the agreement the schengen and i would like want that you the french government to explanation early
i i is this a very foreign interpretation the the agreement the schengen i know the almost certainly that if the the was has to a train with bankers or a  with meal the french government many attempting would are been
thank you mr 
we will look under what circumstances this ban was was
mrs the president since october the political prisoners in turkey a hunger the to their death can lead the give they expression the their protest against the policy the the turkish government the constituency  used to the moral and the resistance the the prisoners to break
they be supported by other imprisoned the also a hunger are started
further are also the mothers the the prisoners in hunger has and the in many countries solidarity with them expressed
i must the also the murder the the denounce to the a directed the the grey wolves few days ago in rotterdam  the a the the 
i i you also a letter sent mrs the president
i like like that the parliament through you through the bureau a protest compromise the the turkish government and reduce the end the this extremely inhumane  the political prisoners
thank you mr korakas
i will see what i can do
mrs the president i like like your aid invoked
in the parliament applies the rule that smoking the certain places including the direct vicinity the the chamber banned is
on few very deal we the subject tobacco
the entry was i here today bullets the large clouds those with the congratulate the the mr brok
and that was not for the first
during meetings the the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence which the mr brok president is is he also to smoking
i think that unacceptable and also has the a avalanches
the the last sitting the the commission foreign affairs the i i attended strike also other commissioners a do the
in the important the everyone must the rules respect to be by who than also
the is extremely important that the nosmoking by everyone the observed and therefore also by the members the the parliament
the is  the them to the not account to the
there are members the physical pollution affected the the  as mrs lynne the there regular on nuisance
you you there the the members and that applies with particularly for the member that i just i mentioned the insist not to smoking this where a nosmoking applies
i understand you very good mrs mckenna and i will ensure ensure that the rules the respect
products
the the item is the recommendation for the second reading a the the commission environment health and consumer on the common position by the council the with the view the the adoption the the directive the the european parliament and the council on the mutual adaptation the the legal and administrative provisions the the member on the production the presentation and the sale the products c cod
president the is now for the second time this year that we on this directive talk and again are there many amendments tabled
that was course at not need been if the council in june what more eight had beaten or all eight had beaten the our first reading and the the amended proposal the the european commission that such end in our direction was
fortunately are there since also thanks the conciliation the the commission efforts been the the heats presidency and i think that the positions however what closer the other are has
the legislation take not place in a vacuum as the negotiations for the framework  in the world demonstrate is there a global development to still further control the what the world the  as
president how far must we the to
how far should we to
i am witness been the the concern in our commission legal affairs on the consequences the the judgement the the court the october on the  and i part the opinion that there the certainly consequences are for this directive and also for the  in the general
i am also the opinion that the arguments for reinforced involvement the the european parliament therefore greater transparency better democratic control only but more are become
there were adjustments necessary in the directive and the are now also proposed
i think the only unfortunately that our commission legal affairs this content not constructive has can help
i would the like the vision the the commissioner the the problem the this legal basis hear
i think that the the important is are opinion here the table to have
the political basis is clear harmonise the the market with respect the a high level the health and consumer and move the existing legislation and  scientific insight
the internal market must really strengthened be example by mutual recognition the trials and the development the common standards
and who the this than then the the must not the country to country the different additional conditions to meet
this is not crusade against smokers the is also not ban the smoking
that would undesirable are and fact within
the is the a strengthening the the individual responsibility and hope a contribution the the prevent the smoking under young
according the world the there in the european union  per day
that is almost per minute
the the new smokers each year is under than and the majority of are young women the especially socalled light cigarettes smoking
a ban the such misleading definitions is therefore the large important control the this product is necessary
the is the best generic product in the european union but we know more the the content the a culprits cadavers and the the reason the  than the the average do
this directive the ensure that we last will know what there in cigarettes is and why
if we that than then know must as quickly possible be have to a common list the permitted ingredients as now already in  form there in the united kingdom in france in belgium and in germany
i refers this however hesitation the the commission and i understand the hesitation not as good
this parliament like like a commitment that such list there before is but during the life the this commission or in any case for the time the proposed
we are that that the member than also time the necessary information provide
ingredients the  dependence strengthen of must the possible are the already earlier to ban
the set the the  the tar nicotine and  is very important
i question i moreover the the or we here in the future still many profits for the health can achieve
 is a complex issue
the harmfulness especially is him in the tar and the  and other ingredients and there is more knowledge necessary on the harmful but perhaps even also the positive sides the 
the is for the hand that what unsafe is for european consumers also unsafe is for other consumers and therefore not exported must be
i am the to find for a possibility the a derogation this the such three year which companies production and marketing can adapt so employment not wasted to outside the european union the moved
health must improve to be
the european parliament has grateful use made the  research and i think that we the term also further the on the will to
now want we still not as far to
however is the the as that we find that the warnings in each case just as large must are if in poland where they now are and i regret the that the council not further wanted to than
president i hope that this parliament the by the environment proposed amendments supports
mr the president ladies and gentlemen i like like briefly like the the consequences the the judgement the the court the justice the the european communities in matter c with the to the directive on the production presentation and sale the products the currently in second reading by the parliament the discussed
first is the as that there from the  clear need is the regulation the the free movement the products in the community in this context is article the the treaty the right legal for this proposal
the second there the not doubt that by a better explanation the the consequences the this provision for the internal market the article only but the force will win
with particularly the provisions the article on the maximum permitted  must better be explained in the considerations the the directive
they must better again to give how the obstacles the the free movement the goods among from the way think to overcome or the think to count with unfair competition
the finally like i on article still the next say when there in the european union only products according the above directive should be produced means that automatically a export for products with higher tar nicotine or 
the european parliament has than also proposed to article that the has the the community trade to to add the article if legal
the commission can the in this solution find provided there a specific article in the text the the directive the included which the exports if such the regulated
that would example apply for a amendment on the period the must be applied for the exports the cigarettes the not meet the article the the directive
president when we the spectrum for the choice are the interests the the industry to defend than the to choose to the to to for the health than is for us the choice quickly made than to we for the health
that like say that we work make the the reduction the the  the tar nicotine and carbon than choose we for adequate and substantially warnings and than ban we misleading very
than choose we also for efficient regulations the certain technical issues
despite this clear guinea must we aware that we a parliament are the a union the the principles the the rule high in the hold bears and this the in that we the borders must recognise the our competence that we must know to where the borders to the the competence the we sense the article the legal the we invoked for the new tobacco
if i the judgement that the   good read i than must be up or there a european market for products there
than must be up or there obstacles for the internal market there or  can the
than must the third be up or the provisions the we approve actually will contribute to the improve the the force the the internal market and or they in relationship are to the to achieve objective
the fourth must be up or the content choices where we for are contribute to a high level the protection the health because also that the us life in article
global taken see i for this directive the matter not problem
i am than also very very satisfied with the answer that i already the advance was the a question the also in our group live the answer the the commissioner on how we now must deal with the proposal to a calculated for products the we itself not want use immediately in this directive to regulate
if that can regulated be the a legal number way by a addition the a reference to the legal the article the the treaty than think i that that a solution is the we with at all must support and than hope i also that we the the  not the us path will find later
in each case is the as that when now or later would will that we that calculated not the to we than in each case all efforts must do to the later to regulate
because to ethical reasons can no in europe the accept that products the we not good enough find for ourselves the we not by the europeans want let use that we the products the without more can export to example the africans
that must excluded are
the must therefore agree regulated be
late us hope that we this now can do
president to the to conclude still this
mrs martens was the javettele for the group
they had serious reasons to here something later the to to today
they hopes still the time to are such that they the together the the  can conclude
otherwise i i also in its name about
mr the president the discuss and the adopt today in second reading the the maaten forms a important test  for the ability the the parliament to to answer the the expectations the the citizens the institutions demands the in the are clear decisions to take
the is to their living and  which the protection the the health a still greater weight the
in this the is the work the the environment especially thanks the commitment the our rapporteur really remarkable been
one thing must clear are we are not the the point a unaltered good to approve for the fight against the smoking that still still the most causes is in the european union
the harmonisation the the national legislation on the production the presentation and the sale the products for a maximum protection the the health is a objective the we other the certainly must and can achieve
as said contains this directive four points reduction the the tar nicotine and  ban the the use the definitions if light and  the in the general if misleading be as uniform legislation and where need ban the the other ingredients and additives the often  effects have for the  and with particularly the dependence increase and finally more and better warnings the the cigarette to to point the the large risk that the the by a do the to to and to the young try to from the this  form the addiction
by the three existing directives together to add is clear that the the strictly the the the borders the the be by the to the force the the internal market to improve same see the there not the the a strategy to promote the at is the the to the the damage and the debt the the  the a were scourge is and where we social and economic given a large price for must pay
the this second reading have we two important ensure had the first wanted we political given the objective the health to protect reconcile with the also legitimate interests the the production and the employment
the application the the new limits for toxic substances in the by the european union  cigarettes may enough if example
order this fundamental principle to defend have we therefore proposed to the legal to extend to article the the treaty and especially to the date the force the this provision for  from to to to january
our second concern the legal the nature was has us to the the mutual dependence between the harmonisation the the market and the protection the the health still greater to make the have we closely the indications followed the resulting from the  the the judgement which the court the justice recently the  has destroyed
we have therefore fruitful and important work done also because the differences with the common position the the council limited are for far we the have can look are especially after the vote in the environment the differences with the ideas in the council as small that we the specific possibility start to see quickly a effective compromise to achieve
already this work to liberticidal help as is suggested and the also the possibility a positive message in the direction the the citizens to do take is course legitimate than must the however the the courage people that openly political to area and the not behind behind a formal respect the the treaties
we have there everything the done to in the parliament a as large possible agreement to achieve so our institution just if the other occasions the force take the for the citizens the to to if a safe beacon that not sensitive is for specific interests
if that not manage than will in any case clear are the who this the responsibility is
mr the president i will the last are the people their right to to smoking would want deny but think personally the that people the want smoking that must do in the decided area the their own house
this rule is also the application the all other dangerous drugs resources the the or be used and which probably only the user itself damage will affected
the dangerous means is doubt the cocktail the tobacco nicotine and other chemicals that offer the for a high extent the addiction and dependence
authorities have the task to citizens information to give so they considered decisions can take and own choices can make
earlier this year decided the canadian authorities the citizens more to to information on products and a counterbalance to offer against the intensive lobby and the huge financial interests the the  the is now as regulated that the parcels cigarettes in canada images must be made the let see what smoking governance with the health does
from research that that such images many better transfer how bad smoking for the health is than televised warnings
i question the members support to give the the amendment that is tabled by john bowis behalf the group   behalf the socialist group and myself
the amendment has to objective the authorities the eu more power to give to such images in their own country the parcels cigarettes in to to
i i emphatically that we there not the from are this images for all member compulsory to to
the the member simply a additional right to they in to to
the people must the choice have or they already than not want smoking
let we there in any case for ensure that they good informed are when they the choice make
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the new alternative the  has already s deaths caused in europe therefore have the council the commission and the parliament the this europe decided a ban from to legislation the the use the meal and the the in the food to the not the advance tested bovine over than thirty months
that ban is a good matter but the is the a little late
already decades years long however die per year  people the the consequences the the use the a certain drug the globalized of are doctors and hospitals the know
this be although with until fight but apart the few very campaigns the in fact nothing who taken
if than a directive the presented for the regulations the the distribution the this drug and the information on i am here on tobacco start certain mr programmes at to to if you however agree was what for enormous health tobacco caused would you immediately insist the a ban the this drug
you use because also the ban the other substances the in terms respect many less dangerous are you you responsible for the health the millions citizens but also for thousands deaths under not sufficient  young
yesterday are in the united states processes won against  they were condemned of before and lies on the  the their products
today has in france the from the the department forwarders the right been to a procedure the to effort against the industry
tomorrow will the processes however just as the the affected blood or the mad at are against those the knew but nothing were that like say against you the decisionmakers the legislators
let we therefore together something take let we together a step to a very small step in compared with already what done would must be
let we the nicotine and tar reduce additives ban as ammonia that the added the nicotine to a still greater addiction the cigarettes bring to to readable warnings make the least the the area the the cigarette cover and the population inform on the risk programmes and dangers the tobacco the integrationist where as light and  remove which young and especially young women be achieve to smoking in the were that the cigarettes less harmful are although the penal the there long on agree are that the strong increase the certain forms the hits with small  still difficult the to encourage cells and with still  forecasts probably the the with the  the this type cigarettes let we therefore also the social and economic costs measure the tobacco and the subsidies the tobacco change in real subsidies for conversion to example the overhaul the cereals the replace the meal decisions that the for exports intended products same rules the application must are if the for the internal market intended products the price the tobacco increase because considering has a direct impact the the consumption by with particularly young and the taxation harmonise
this is not except many gentlemen mr programmes and the will the the interests the the industry not really the the stake to the some under us obviously a what heart strongly than the  the the population
there must still very many be done
as must we this directive enlargement to other products than cigarettes to example  and  the not less harmful are the ban the advertising for this  products confirm and the collective rules for  enlargement
with other words there is still a hope work the the shop
the adoption the the maaten is a first step i need you from the  the the next generations for view to the and this step to to
mr the president members since the judgement the the court the justice on the directive advertising are there the this report on and proposal for a amendment the the directive the various sides question the
there are also amendments tabled to the whole proposal the the parliament to reject
we are however the opinion that there large differences there between the question to advertising and this directive
we find the course that article together with article the legal forms for this directive as the commission environment health and consumer proposed in amendment
the directive which the proposal is develop is based the article also is the issue because directly on the content the goods the the internal market
we are positive the the content the the report and support the main
the is with particularly the important that there clear values the be for the dangerous substances in those
amendment on carbon is therefore very positive
we can also the proposals on the size and the very the the warnings support
the differences between the various positions this are as small that the not difficult can are to to a compromise to to
we are also for the ban the the add the  substances
we find the not more than reasonable and consistent that the exports from the european union the cigarettes the in the union to health banned are must be any
there is not reason to the exports special system to to and the deadlines to extended in compared with the production for use in the european union
in the report be also special cigarettes discussed the sold be if said light and such
this form the marketing is often misleading and gives the wrong impression that this cigarettes less dangerous are than other
we see not reason to this type marketing to to are and find that the current position the the commission environment health and consumer the this area can lead to to many exceptions
although the subsidies for the tobacco in this report not the the item to can we the not fail to this absurd enquired to discuss
the is not fair that the union enormous sums investment in the tobacco as now happening
the is consistency and costly
this money would many useful spent can be
the best solution is therefore the subsidies gradually the the to abolish and the on growers to help move to other crops
during a previous treatment the this report was the swedish tobacco for snuff use discussed
there is i i not reason to the current rules that like say a want for sweden and same the right the countries the not tobacco for snuff use want sell to their ban this to maintain now to change
i am therefore welcome that this legislation maintained remains
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes we deal evening a subject that not under our competence is
the is doubt not the first time that that happening but today seems the matter more to are than ever
therefore will i agree to more not words wasting the the formal aspects but only like the the content
the court the justice has recently the directive the on the ban the advertising and sponsorship in the sector cancelled
according the court can a total ban the advertising not justified be with a reference to the good force the the internal market
us parliament comes however the treaties the are flout and feels the obviously established the fellow the the sinking to save without the or to to look pact the the are objective the and trying the the expense the everything the before text it to to
the attitude communicating the a wonderful way the shortcomings the our european institutions this afraid not only means if the is is their ideological objectives to achieve
there are however rules the in eight taken must be
the history late us see how dangerous the is if the to achieve objective how noble and  this also may are over the rules the placed
the defiance which the this matter addresses witness the a  deficit the realism
in place the learn to draw from the the october on in luxembourg  volkswagen games we in a attitude the legal the not few way good to talk is
our group importance the the important the the protection the the health and makes the serious ensure on the consequences the a such political attitude this is in fact suicide
the directive will the on in be been if we the matter not otherwise tackle
the must however the health not use in a  that to objective has any day again powers way to to the the member
health is a many to important subject to if political instrument to be used
what solutions have we than
us i is there only one solution we must learn draw from the judgement the the court the justice
we must also our version review and this as up that the the in the treaties intended balance the respected
mr the president from this place like i mr maaten congratulate for are excellent report where he very hard the work has
i think that this the three existing directives good are brought in a new directive
the would course many better been are if we us at not with  are did to the
unfortunately is the however as that there still still tobacco produced presented and sold the
and although everyone can know that the bad for the health is the the however still still used
if tobacco if new product the the european market permitted would must be would the to health certainly rejected be
if cadavers or  just dangerous would are if tobacco would they certainly banned be
the by the environment proposed strict labelling has my support for both the size if the content the the  the the 
the proposal the the council for the size the the warnings the other than  think i however better than what in amendment the since the border the  many to close is the the area the a cigarette cigarettes
what the messages as low tar said and light applies for i still still that they misleading are therefore am i fact against the amendments and
i am very welcome that the ban the the addition the ammonia or other  products in the second reading the maintained
the seems i clear that we such practices not to must are
finally must i there unfortunately again the point that the european tobacco still still not consistent is
one the tobacco discouraged hand the there annual more than billion euro spent the subsidies the tobacco
i am the be again my wish from that this still a time is change
mr the president i like i here like strong make for the workers in the industry
in northern is a large manufacturer the products   located
if this directives be adopted to there least jobs lost
i i carefully examined what the commissioner has said against my mr the mr hume not massive redundancies in this sector
i see not how a reduction the the tar the to milligrammes as in the current text the proposed his consequences can have for the employment
the most difference between earlier reductions the the maximum permitted tar and this reduction is simply that previous reductions limited were to the eu
twentyfive cent the the production the  is for for the exports
if this directive the adopted will there jobs disappear
the manufacturers will there not one do less to sell than now because they outside the eu will to produce
 will the production to are russian factory move and the limits for the tar will be ignored but the export we the jobs
the loss the jobs the  will workers take the average such year old are
who in northern the yearold age are jobs lose has not many opportunity somewhere otherwise still work to find
that is in this context my the concern
mr the president given the blame that we  intentions would have while we us only opposed have against the lack the a legal or better said doubts have expressed on the legal the certain articles the the before directive like i the have on the balance between the institutions
the interinstitutional balance is namely a source the legitimacy for the european construction
also like i speak on the obligations the resulting from the treaties
according the treaty had the commission already over two months ago the judgement must analyse and the relevant conclusions look must draw
today has the commissioner in are extremely short contribution for the first time responded and the are least three time the words no  and  and  used
well mr the president ladies and gentlemen when the in the right are resort must take to wordings if the is clear or there there not doubt than is there certainly as also in this case there the confusion and doubt
mr the president how can the the on the the judgement the the court the justice amendment area with the risk that there for the internal market would there this several member have let know that the the scrapped continue the measures they itself for legislation will ensure
what member and what measures are that
we had precisely the the commission this explanation expect
let we still few examples mention the amendments and
the add the article the the legal is legal  but has the commission fact the really consideration on the overarching article for the external trade according that article must mentioned policy to the competitiveness the our companies to strengthen
how with that the the justification the amendment which the that our industry a period need has this this industry otherwise serious damage would can suffering
how is that together with the to negotiations the to connection in the framework the the world as in same justification the
mr the president this justified doubts are the reason the the vote in the legal commission and not foreign or  alliances with i know not what companies i remind remind that the result the the vote against was
although i itself present was was i course with my voice behind this result
mr the president the member palacio vallelersundi has now the commissioner in the dock the there is on interinstitutional balance about but in this case has the commission only a directive tabled
the parliament and the council are the institutions the the mentioned directive must approve which they under more must look what the right legal is
therefore can the commission certainly not because irregularities in the dock be the
we can the commission especially the not few irregularity regulation because they in this case us only a directive has presented which three existing directives on the level the certain ingredients the products and certain warnings the the packaging are together
there is therefore not there the a really new development
the only liking is a judgement the the court the justice the the european communities the october on the the the court in the with a very other directive the  that the legal the the current article the former article a not adequate is
according the court the justice is the legal not adequate because as tried the a expressly ban in a another article to were also that article is  and is now article in place the
therefore trying the court the justice a divert to avoid which that then used would can be
but in this case does the situation the not for because the directive as the current directives actually the the existing obstacles for the force the the internal market to eliminate
the legal the the proposal the current article the former article a is therefore correctly
the rapporteur the mr maaten has very sensible proposed the legal feasibility to make by a reference the to take to article on the external trade also has he a series changes in a number articles proposed order  the this directive to prevent the basis the the with the mentioned judgement junior law the the court the justice
i would want say that the court the justice the in are judgement has let lead by a to literal interpretation the the text very what parts the the judgement are room for criticism but we must the judgement now once accept
the legal are because towards this the court the justice the highest body is for the interpretation the the community nothing the the parliament however in the way the from to speak for a legal the the articles and includes and the amendments with changes the the rapporteur the i mentioned i in the proposal the to take
course must i behalf the socialist group and especially behalf the socialist members the the legal commission we have in the commission against the  voted the mrs palacio vallelersundi has mentioned say that the pursue the this way a drastic reduction would mean the the legislative competence the the european parliament in the amendments and the tabled are by the mr poettering behalf the group the the european party and mrs palacio vallelersundi and other members the because proposed the directive to reject
my ensure apply the this at therefore not much the health the course important and has are but the reduction the would the if we the very restrictive interpretation the the legislative competence the the european parliament would accept
i believe that the very restrictive explanation essentially the the eliminate the the legislative competence the this institution and the the council would characteristics
i believe not that the a such very restrictive way the can because from the the content and the the substantial content the by the mr maaten and others is stressed there there a risk if the parliament and the council this interpretation the the leader the the european party and the mrs palacio vallelersundi would accept the parliament the council and the community institutions in their whole would than with hands and being bound are the the further development the the institutions the legislative level the as important that to are for the development the the community
to the reason support the socialists the amendments the the mr maaten and reject we course the amendments and the the group the the european party
mr the president the is to regret that despite the  efforts the rapporteur maaten the to the the must to to that no really satisfied is with the developments the this report now characteristics
i like three short comments formulate
the first what the the legal
the judgement the the court has the assessment done and the very expressly that article legal can are in some cases if certain conditions fulfilled are but the also that in certain cases article not enough example for what the calculated the must article to be added
given the the fact that there not lack the justification is support i therefore the amendment the mrs the palacio vallelersundi to the common position to reject and the commission to ask a new proposal in to must
with the to the other comments like i here to that the the not must harp the symbols the the problem the whose not tackle
the lift the higher  is not form 
the outside disproportionate increase the the area for warnings is not form means to the intended objective to achieve to know a better health
also fear i that this a bad example will are to later also warnings the other products the to to
mr the president we know all that the here to a an important report is
the is as important because the credibility the the european health the the balanced
the is to regret that also in the commission legal affairs and internal market positions to the are has the to that the ban the the court the justice the advertising the directive in certain sense unnecessary makes
that is however at not the case the directive has the the the ingredients the tobacco and not the the advertising ensure
the must the parliament not more with this issue mislead the must understand that the now the important is the very regarding report the rapporteur maaten to defend
must now than the descriptions light and said the the packaging be banned
we must continue the the view that such misleading descriptions not tolerated should be and the judgement the the court the justice the october brings this not change in
we must to the the position that we already earlier have welcome
the is very logical that in all countries where the as sensible is been a relatively strict  the to to the number people that the hits  and the prevent the heart and cardiovascular clear is has
that everything must we also the european level can regulate within the internal that based must are the a high extent the protection the the health
president if this proposal in second reading actually law the lead this to that the freedom the companies somewhat the contained and that the health something better the protected
the strong on the this proposal is that the not is on the behaviour the the individual consumer the products the is at the a compulsory information by the companies the all consumers and the the ban to  ammonia to to add
this means that the less opportunity the to the impression to give that the without risk the early die can smoking
the spread the reassurances lies the difficult
the weak on is that the emphasis strong is the the promotion the the free competition
the impose the in all member equal european standards seems especially intended to are to the different  all equal opportunities to offer to money to deserve
this liberal point the not shared by my group
the is us there especially to how you the people protects against the damage the products seriously the their health
my group had would a proposal given that a comprehensive approach means
from the point health would than must be regulated how advertising and sponsorship disappear and young as less possible to smoking
further would the must to on what consequences the reduce the the production and consumption the tobacco must have for replacement employment for  and  how we a end make the the current european subsidies for the grow the tobacco and what we do to the international trade in this work product against to to
as this not happening can any european measure largely destroying be done by more exports the american tobacco
what now in second reading still can be decided is a weak  the the most  proposals which a half year ago after the first reading was voted
when is already a all text accepted but the ministers take still still that the judgement the the parliament to far is
i represent the part the the group the united left that the proposals the the rapporteur in first reading has supported and that are all proposal in second reading also will support
the  is to weak but without a such decision can products still more lives destroy
mr the president the is precisely that we moral compulsory are to the million consumers in the european union fully in to explain on the dangers the the do for the health
different groups have the i because i member am the the commission environment health and consumer strong the the a more legislation on the sale and presentation the products in europe
i am the the i agree with the amendments the recently in our commission are adopted and the to objective have the large public still more to warn for the dangers the smoking
the amendments the by our commission are approved focused the increasing the the divergent for general warnings as smoking brings the health serious damage to the the front the parcels cigarettes the to and the the divergent for additional warnings the to
few examples the the additional warnings the the commission the the parcels cigarettes included like see the the smokers die the person age than nonsmokers smoking caused fatal hits smoking is very addictive find aid the the put and  the children late they your those not breathe
our commission is also the opinion that  the warnings must be for
research has demonstrated that there less the  as the warning the the parcels cigarettes greater the 
the results the the research the this area are as clear that the wrong would are if we legislators the the eu a such opinion not would follow
we must the million consumers in the european union what the smoking the a clear message give and we will if authorities already the necessary do to our children and the smokers to warn for the health the the smoking the cigarettes with the of
to finally still this the european parliament has since the treaty the amsterdam coordination power in affairs the the environment and the consumer concern and the will course the this area closely work with the council and the commission
we see this procedure if a important legal weapon in the parliamentary arsenal and we are also the the plan the to use
i like the rapporteur like congratulate with the report
mr the president nothing than praise for the good intentions the the members the this directive support but i like there the the point that the ban the the produce the tobacco over the  considerable consequences will have for the employment in my region
i objective with particularly the the factory the   in southampton where the whole relocation for the market outside the eu for is
by the arrival the this directive will the factory this cigarettes not more can produce already are the  course not the application the the market the the him
that like however not say that this cigarettes not produced will be
the on company bat will the production transfer to countries outside the eu
therefore in place the cigarettes to we employment from only already in my region is the the to jobs
however can i ironic enough in this directive not only ban the the cultivate the tobacco in the community find also already the there in countries as greece tobacco grown the as strong is that use that for  the on the this directive a crime would are
a community the this tobacco subsidise and the sale the the tobacco then illegal makes the people the their jobs prevents and their life should ordinary people the on are the income the goods the not agree in the community be sold can not count the the respect the the citizens
how you also think on this directive i request you tomorrow support to give the my amendment which i question to the ban the the production for the exports to countries outside the eu from the directive to to
this directive has not only positive effect the the health outside the eu
the is a classic symptom the the fact beaten political standardised
mr the president gentlemen colleagues first must i something correct the commission legal affairs and internal market has the whole directive already in first reading rejected but the plenary sitting has the this not the members
after the decision the the court the justice has the commission the opinion still a time but this time with a large majority adopted
the judgement the the court has the legal situation although not principle changed but however the further developed some aspects are now more and more
the has indeed nothing with tobacco to make the judgement the the court the justice had just as good the can have the a ban the advertising for alcohol or chocolate we know finally all that also sugar harmful can are for the health
the is according i disgraceful how external the commission and the council since have responded the this judgement the the court i must the say that they there at not the responded have they have the simply left let are
that applies also for the speech that commissioner byrne just has taken and also for the explanatory the the common position the has the not need found to least the considerations the somewhat the to apply and to correct
only the legal service the the parliament makes a commendable exception
unfortunately i i to little time to the the details in to to that is simply impossible
i like only but a appeal do the the colleagues to the opinion the the legal commission to follow
the is not to the tobacco the is to not more and not less than the respect the the treaties
the is also not to legal chicanery the is to a political very market issue and the to the respect the other powers the the subsidiarity but also the the rights and powers the the colleagues in the national parliaments
in nice is the future distribution the the powers the the item has
a such event is however unnecessary when everyone the position the the majority respects after there the basis the arguments a such majority to the is has between the three institutions the commission the council and the parliament than need we only still but a clear institutional framework to create
i hope and expect that the european court the justice end the the path way i am that that the court more attention will to the the respect the the different powers and the directive again will relation explain
mr the president to to start congratulate i the mr maaten with the excellent report
i think that also the mr byrne a  deserves for are clear speech on the legal
if i to mrs palacio and the mr lechner  think i the the reports the we now on the american courts hear
i mean the serious dilution the justice and political what the legal not promotes
i think that the for the health the the european population the large important is that we the  the tar to below to and that we for nicotine and carbon in cigarettes also  the
we must that ensure that the commission latest end a proposal for a common list the permitted ingredients tabled
to still to were the industry all information on the ingredients secret but this must course a end the to
addition the the the a common list is the to my opinion also important that there a ban is the the use the ammonia and other similar connections the to must the  and the dependence the cigarettes to increase
also this must we a end make
to finally like i something say on the exports
i understand opposition not that a majority the the members the this house favour is the drift  for europe than for their own governments the the many moves the the this issue involved are finally however represent
i am the with mrs thyssen agree that the ethical given absolutely not by the unacceptable can from europe cigarettes to export the we for our own population to harmful find
this is ethical irresponsible and therefore hope i that we the this level more responsibility the the day will to to the example the the council and the commission
mr the president the seems i necessary the conditions for the production and the sale the tobacco the to more that must we the a harmonised way do with a directive the all member must failure with if objective the prevention to improve and the consumer better to protect against the habit the the smoking
however seems the i honest said unacceptable the differences in believe on the content the the directive to interpret if a schroedter clash between the powerful interests the the  and the general important the the protection the the citizens
the accept the a such interpretation would a deterrents are the the legitimate arguments the a considerably number members the the european parliament the in the need the legal rules to respect the guarantee see for the future viability the our own legislative
if we the opinion are that there a number common binding rules need are to the health the the citizens better to protect against the risks the tobacco let we than roads seek without that there  the without loopholes the our good intentions down and filtering
the public opinion can and must not purely major be with political gesture the not solid anchored are in the reality the what possible is according the powers the the treaties us to
mr the president smoking is the tragedy the our time the main cause the illnesses and diseases the to prevent are and that applies for the whole european union
in the european union die each year more than a half million people while that fact not not and that number will still further grow if we now nothing take
therefore is this directive as important greater and   clearer texts the warn for the health a ban the misleading descriptions as light ultra and said a maximum tar for products for for the eu and outside and for the first information on the ingredients
if relatively new member the the parliament is i noticed with what a lessening the the in this parliament against this directive opposition
there are the this debate so  used that the start to seem the a exercise in  but where we the on have is still always the health
the power the the large manufacturers the products is clear
i like already my colleagues that point that tobacco a unique product is
you affects remind  and you is remind death
the is a fact that the the people with smoking start for they eighteen year old are and however that the industry that the people adult choices make
the is a fact that the the smokers like put but there the within the industry but little policy developed to this people the the smoking the to help
in place of that the that the the smoking under young trying back to insist
if we when the tobacco are advent was on this product had conscience what we now know would we the if  have classified
the is a fact that in the previous century almost twice so people the the consequences the tobacco are died than in the two wars together
if we now nothing take will there this century to estimated world a billion deaths the
let we there everything the do to lives to save and a end make the the power the the industry with are large interests the only but lives 
mr the president no underestimated the harmful consequences the the smoking for the health but also the policy for the health must a sound legal have
in the balance between the protection the the health and the usefulness the the advertising for tobacco has the court the justice recently a believe spoke and that is clear the is not the task the the commission or the the european union to this things to regulate that is the task the the member
the only exception the made for a  the the internal market
the commission has this however not only proof for made not only contrary
where the market from balance is where different tax apply in greece with the special regulations this remains everything as the was
the is therefore business mr the commissioner when here the done if there nothing is changed since the judgement the the european court the justice
i i this not words for
if we not prepared are to the legal aspects to look predict i that this directive by the court the justice relation will be declared and that the parliament and the commission a just bad figure will we if the first time
mr the commissioner you you the guardian the the treaties and you must not the own authority your powers exceed
you used article if basis for the export i must however the that we in the common trade not can determine what third countries must import
also the legal is according i completely unusable therefore is the precisely that the unions the employers and the workers point the the consequences for the employment
by the export are jobs the the put which only already in britain
with this measure achieve we nothing the production falling namely not the the only but moved
we want apparently others prescriptive how they must life
that is presumptuous and the court will us not right give
mr the president tobacco makes lives destroying
to large shame the this european union questions we our taxpayers the cultivation the this  product to subsidising for the some amount the more than billion euro per year
same to we sensible measures to the smoking to discourage with particularly under young in risk because we the whole world in our internal market want tomorrow
if we other countries our  want continue impose by the sensible proposals the we for the internal market have however also to let apply for the exports to we already the good work that the mr maaten has done the the stake
there is not us the exports follows the advertising as the night follows the the day
would the commissioner can explain or the delete the the exception for the exports only the application is the the tar and  as in the commission was suggested or the all proposals in the directive
we must that know because there in  nottingham southampton and belfast thousands jobs the the stake are
the jobs can within the even times disappear if we not exactly know how the is and therefore wrong vote
i like that sensible measures ahead find and not lost to
i like that there a end is the misleading descriptions as said and light the the impression give that some cigarettes safer are more  makes they certainly not safer
this labelling must than also to disappear
there must not exception to be made for certain embraces otherwise create we again new derogations the the area the the competition and the internal market
i am before warnings in the form the photographs before sensible reference the ingredients before research the european scale and before real measures to children those tar nicotine and  to the
i like this everything not in risk the see by our attempts this directive from to relationship over the legal competence the the european union and the parliament
president the tobacco affects two points the our group very the i to the harmonisation the the internal market and the health
systems favour rightly for more protection the the health
therefore are we before the directive and before the reduce the the yield tar nicotine and 
therefore are we also before the increase the the warnings with the common position and are we just if the common position before short strong  the the  and before the ban the the use the misleading words if said light and 
only where this part are the  and already the the market take  would considered can be to this to to are
the industry nuisance on inequalities and inefficiency in the current legislation
the inequality the example the permitted ingredients
the proposal to to work the one list the ingredients the are allowed support we the i
too is the the the affairs the the tests
now must for each product in each country again tested be
we are ensure that we to to a by all eu recognised uniform testing from to to by a in a country recognised 
and we are  that such test carried in a by one the the eu recognised laboratory in all member the the eu valid is just as the the area the the medicines usual is to example extrapolating from to saving
special attention questions we for the position the the central and small
this the by the directive disproportionate been affected in some cases with particularly by article member
we are than also before the amendment that the asking to information to the used ingredients but a realistic method proposed than now expressed in the common position
what the the legal the next
the directive building continue the three existing directives on same subject the same legal have
this have to the date never problems with the to the legal made
the legal services the the institutions see not problems the this area
certainly after addition the article to we that from that the legal good
course want we legal correctly act and course would the regrettable are if the court end the position the our legal services would reject but we should the directive not reject than have we namely nothing is already the work for nothing been and can we again start with simply same work and same texts
for the parliament is the now matter political courage to show and a directive to the to to the the force the the internal market improves and a maximum protection offers the the area the health
president i am my group grateful that they i still additional time like give
i like the commissioner like thank for are comment on the legal basis
 join i i the the what the gentlemen medina ortega and lund on have said
i i still the two supplementary comments
the first on article
the reporting by this commission is crucial for future policy
i am also pleased that this commissioner this responsible is
i i the ensure on the capacity the the commission to the this more to work
i hope that the commissioner perhaps prospect can offer the strengthening the the human support within the commission
finally president there are important changes in this common position the the council necessary
the is important for the legal basis for further harmonisation the the market for better protection the the consumer and as further
each the this elements the the lacks perhaps sufficient support here in this parliament for the qualified majority
but if package would the must lead to a better balanced and more performanceorientated legislation
the shown was also present in the environment
i think the mrs martens and the mr guido and the cooperation the we this have had
i call you therefore the this compromise to support
mr the president i like start with briefly something to tell on the history the this directive before they here in the parliament the table was the
the directive was introduced if response the the  lópez the  from which many elements frustrated the also in the current text to find are and which was asked to a proposal the the commission
from the debate which the proposal in second reading the discussed that that there very quickly progress is made
the late see that both the council the ministers if the parliament there shipping behind have the
i like also the efforts mention the the mr maaten the the dossier the a balanced rigorous way has dealt
the consequences the tobacco for the health be now published recognised and both the the legislative bodies if the the public live the conviction that the time is has for a strict legislation on this product
the proposal contains a number important improvements the relation the the current legal situation and address the the the create the harmonised rules for a number affairs the with  to make have
for other affairs applies that the basis is the for the data the the elements the need are for the up the initiatives
a the the most improvements is the release the a new lower  and and that is for the first the a ceiling carbon and  in cigarettes
this upper applies and on there the necessary controversy for all products the in the union already than not for domestic use be produced
the arguments the to the are the on possible loss the employment are carefully balanced against the security that we if we not the the limits to a product export that we not good enough consider for citizens the the community
i like there also the point that there already there was the possible loss the employment when the original directives the now be review more than ten year ago were tabled
the loss the employment that when was predicted has never place
in fact the the loss the employment in this sector mainly caused by the has investment in informatics as the companies itself also have said
the commission feels there however the for to for the application the the rules for  products a longer period in to to so there more time is for the adaptation the  and the development the new 
the mr bowis has asked or the exemption the application is
the exemption is the application the article as i the amendment least interpret that like say tar nicotine and 
what the issue the the descriptions the the parcels the like i like stress that the use the certain terms as light with a low tar and said very misleading can work
people steps the the one type do on the the other because they the wrongly adopt that the light do safer is for their health
such descriptions ensure there also also for that people continue smoking and not try to with smoking to put
the is than also clear that there in the important the the consumer legislation must to
in the negotiations the now be held on a  on the health the currently fact into the same provisions proposed
the community legislation will than also good with the the future international agreements as the the risk the trade prevent but the means also more protection the the consumer and a better health
i like remind add that the european court the justice in are judgement with the to matter has the that the health a legal is addition and together with article the the treaty
i would like your attention want draw the this judgement the the court
i am there not fully the convinced that everyone the the here on this subject has expressed the judgement has read
i would everyone the that still not has done want economic the be to do
in point the the judgement the example when the the conditions is met including the articles a now and if legal can be used can the fact that the the to make choices the protection the the health crucial was for the striven not customs forms to this articles if legal to take
contrary article member rules that the demands on protection the the health a part the the policy the other areas are and article a member demand emphatically that the the harmonisation a high level the protection the the health the guaranteed
i like you also point the point the the judgement
i like the like interpret in the context the the question the i is the on the already than not present are the a substantial legal
the would in principle therefore possible are to the basis the article a the the treaty a directive the to to the advertising in newspapers conference and  prohibits to the free movement the the press to guarantee as example directive which article illustrate for products prohibits order the freedom the television to promote
from the judgement that clear the opinion the the judges that article if legal can be used for the regulate the the internal market
in fact names they the the formulate the their conclusion on the right judgement in this specific matter the position in that certain aspects the the regulation the the market for products and advertising the and other not can be allowed
in point the the judgement to they as in the points and the this judgement is said had the basis the article a the the treaty a directive can be the which certain forms the advertising and sponsorship for products were banned
given the the general nature the the by the directive how ban the advertising and sponsorship for advertising would a partial invalidity the the directive however content that the provisions the the directive by the court were amended
to a such amendment is however the striven responsible
the is for the court therefore not possible to the directive the partly relation to explain
this is a very important point in the judgement the the court
the shows clear the what the nature the the decision the the court is some aspects are allowed other not
given the general nature the the directive can we the a not separate the the another and therefore must we the whole directive relation explain
the is a clear indication for the further approach the this type affairs
the the question on the exports the the mr bowis i earlier proposed can i a clear answer give in the boundless case that the part the the directive that the has the the exports the disputed and if the court the opinion is what i moreover not expect that the not legal has is the clear that the can be fee the the directive
even in the circumstances would the directive means continue
what that the like i there the point that there in the international and community legislation not exceptions be made for identified embraces in measures the be taken the protection the the health with particularly in this specific case which the effect the the behaviour the the citizens as dramatically is
what the ammonia the a ban take the commission many to premature
the is better to to wait to the subject additives in the first report the the commission the the item is
the is however also clear that the concern on this subject the exacerbated by internal  the through legal processes to outside is
the would not sensible are to this data to ignore
the commission the than also for to very carefully with the subject ammonia to to to and first scientific opinion in to win and all available information to consult
the commission will with particularly further like the the funds use the additives to the  nature the products to increase
what the additives in the general the is the commission prepared to with priority attention to give the this subject the basis the the information the they the producers and importers the as also was the in the statement the was made the the adopt the the joint position
a judgement do before we the necessary data in hands have is speculative and premature
we must sufficient time have to this information to analyse and the experts to opinion to questions
also like the commission what this subject the its right the initiative that they within the framework the the treaty has retain
for the size the the  can doubt a satisfactory compromise be found perhaps the basis the the unwieldiness proposal the june which already account was taken with the the first reading tabled amendments
the use the  in  is perhaps premature and still not debated investigated
the commission the the for the available data to into and to course time the this subject back to to
the make the a  the maximum size the a number large parcels would a reasonable solution are
on the  has the mr davies said that the perhaps possible is to member to to are this type advertising the the cigarette the to to
i can i not in this idea find and the to two reason the first goes the in against the  that the use the article if legal justifies the second if member already the this way would want  is there this not few legal sanction or absolutely the eu for need
the subject  is outside the scope the this text but the commission is prepared the there in a other context on to the to to determine what approaches possible are
this subject has to make with the access the products with particularly where  the are the areas where monitoring there
what the amendment on the gmos the think the commission that this amendment better in a additional recital can be included than in a separately article
what the  the the amendment that the has the the approval the experiments is unnecessary because the movement the goods the meet the the provisions the the directive already in a another article the regulated
we must also set that there where need control the the results the experiments place
what the frequency the notification by the industry the seems the i clear that a annual notification not need is
what the the community agricultural this is not subject that in this text the the item is and reference in the considerations would legal not precisely are
there the in any case a full revision the the community agricultural on tobacco planned for
what the tax the am i the there fully that agree that the price the products and in the longer of the tax the tobacco important affairs are if the is is tobacco for young less attractive to make
this aspect is however not the subject the the current directive
we must ensure ensure not all elements in to to the not be covered by the legal the the internal market or the community trade
in the computer on the application the the  the this problem the the right way the the item the
the finally still this there are in the report in total amendments tabled
the commission can the next amendments however not adopt amendments and
the amendments the the commission the has adopted to this text certainly the good and are a good impact the the concerns as the by the members is expressed
i like the members again thank say for their positive contribute my thank is also from to the mr maaten for the excellent work that he with the to this subject has done

the the item is the report a the mrs  behalf the commission regional policy transport and tourism on the proposal for a directive the the european parliament and the council on the provisions the the area the the  com c cod
mrs the president this report is very clear the this at are directives on the  only five year valid then must they back to the parliament to again to be the
in the report the proposed this regulations permanent to make so the  if the were endlessly by remains are and not any five year by the parliament ratified not to be
there is not good reason to the this in principle not that agree to are
there are precisely many very strong arguments the favour for the up the the  as reduced energy the benefits for the transport and a more planning for hotels and restaurants
also has the  a positive effect the the leisure the the quality the the life there better the and affects the  the the human less balance the most member accept and want the 
the report is than also total not controversial
the benefit the a permanent regulation the the  is that they the planning simplified
sectors the here specific that to make have example the miss the transport the  and the aviation and railways have us and the commission let know that they a permanent regulation for the  very the price would to so they forward can plans
the  has also benefits for the internal market where similar  apply
in the report the in being proposed that the current regulations which the  start the the last sunday in march and end the the last sunday in october the force continue and a permanent nature to
there are however amendments tabled to the regulation after five year to review and on a report the to to
if rapporteur am i before adoption the this amendments because they very sensible are
the most argument for this amendments and for a report after five year has in fact to make with the enlargement the the european union after the summit the nice a completely justified matter
the point is that new member the accession perhaps not on the type regulations have that us for view the perhaps have they time need to the the our regulations the to apply and the type harmonisation that we stand to the to to
given the changes the we probably will are is the not very good idea to now permanent regulations in to to without the possibility to a revision
that is the law argument for a revision and for the amendments the a such revision to objective have
there are also other affairs where we in the framework the the  still like to would want look as energy health and safety but the law argument is doubt that we new member the opportunity want give the the the existing regulations the to apply
i like the parliament than also questions to the the vote support to give the already this amendments to optimum regulations for the existing and future member to can guarantee
mrs the president gentlemen mr programmes the under proposal for a directive on the provisions the the area the the  is a good proposal
this the something by a in task the the commission done extensive study
the findings the this study are very interesting this they a confirmation are the few ideas the we have received
the first is the principle the the  in the most sectors practice become
certain social and economic sectors insist there even the the that the the should to the  a permanent nature the given the is the with particularly to the information the transport the telecommunications and the tourist sector
precise  are a  that included must be in the products and the services the this sectors
therefore must the this the advance know what provisions all member will apply the the should to the 
the second is the study not clear proof the the a number negative consequences the the 
there the example reference made the  but this are the short duration and fully 
what the  the animals and the working the workers in the agriculture the that from the done study nor that there there is the a negative impact
the study is however the to other findings where the usually not the stop
the  join to the seems fully the the the change the way in our societies this change is the result the subsequent working and subsequent  the shops services and public transport
with the should to the  gaining the a additional at light what especially the tourism and the  the good is the increase the the activities in this sectors the than also directly the with the longer and lighter evenings
as seems the  hand in hand to to with a better quality the  globalized the the  have than also over the prevail over the any temporary managed the result the the should
the european parliament has only one amendment tabled the the originally proposal the the european commission
we questions to the drafting the a  report on the impact the the provisions the the  have
if from a such report would will that the provisions on the  must be amended can the commission the need proposals this do
the first report must latest april the light have 
i i goes this amendment not in against the with the proposal the the commission intended objective
the can we the implementation the the provisions on the  the the footing follow without the principle of the to really
we can only pleased are on this proposal the the commission with the decision the provisions on the  for indefinite time to to apply the the the should to the  a permanent european policy made
mrs the president mr the commissioner ladies and gentlemen i i the that there still still fierce discussions be held on the for and disadvantages the the 
the are apparently mainly philosophical discussions and not much specific political debates
therefore think i that we us if parliament not already to long with this subject are must the finally have the member and also the most citizens the  already long accepted if part the us 
this need we here really not more on to bagan
the seems i also really a waste the time and money to here still indepth research the to turn what the and to still the asked
according i have we in europe many greater problems i think the the the movement the enlargement or the topical bse
the is also course that we in the whole union same rules must have for the time the the conversion otherwise would there a chaos the that is already earlier said
also believe i that the citizens the rightly would ask what the sense or the nonsense is the certain european laws
for the farmers and that is also already said is the not ideal to time again to must redeployment the the  and the  that is difficult for the animals but also for the daily work
however say i in all clarity that the  as we the now have more for than disadvantages has
therefore must we the according i this the let and the regulation for unlimited time extended
behalf my group can i therefore say that we not the the amendments will support
the reason this is that my group and i that convinced are that europe greater problems and important tasks has
for the joint house europe is the  not problem
mrs the president the  is in several member already from the years in use
the beginning and  the the  were end few years ago harmonised so the since in all member the the european union right are
as the previous speaker said is the already the the use used
the current proposal is to the opinion the our group good and the by us supported there are not new amendments need
the most is that the  in all member the applied and that the beginning and  the the  right continue
to my opinion is the good that the issues on the  and the application the the legislation on the  accordance the proposal a matter the the member are
harmonisation is than also only need the the practical implementation so the  really in all member same comes
with a harmonised  disappear the obstacles for the free movement the goods services and people and the the internal market more
the into to the consequences the the  make not clear or the consequences for example the agriculture negative or positive are
the main source the concern the in first body the welfare the animals and the working the farmers
the institution the the  has to energy led but the savings will very low to are
according into is the safety has because the programmes night longer light is
longer light evenings offer also opportunities in the light the the increasing free time
mrs the president gentlemen colleagues the  is a good matter that is clear has and will the proposal the the commission in very europe apply the the last sunday in march to the last sunday in september
also is the the intention that the directive for the first time a unlimited period the
that is need and sensible
the only work to the poor is that the commission after five year report must produce on the consequences the the directive
the good function the the european economy especially in the sectors transport communication tourism and measure is on the stable planning the the long term
from the many reactions the the business that very clear that for the good function the the internal market absolutely must be guaranteed that the conversion always the same days place
to economic and social reasons is the essential that the regulation on the  clear understandable and same is only than can everyone plans make without to need fear that the policy suddenly  the thrown
the amendments the the colleagues and the the rapporteur are according i not sense because they lead earlier to more than to less uncertainty
therefore is the sufficient when the commission the results on five year one time assessment
i favour there therefore for to in the plenary just if in the commission regional policy transport and tourism the proposal the the commission without changes good to approve and therefore the amendments the to point
mrs the president gentlemen colleagues now the looting time the the year towards is is the  to speak on the summer or even the 
i like however the attention draw the the each spring and autumn recurring ritual the the right to the the clock on the efficiency which the the opinion can differences
from my contacts with farmers was especially the welfare the the dairy to the and that is also for the weighs the important
the  the ruminant the already by the mad balance
the must now not additional stress cause by the animals the their daily blatantly to let from
cows are not in few days the a change the blatantly used
the is for the agriculture also difficult that in the autumn if there  must be and according the clock the  already disappeared would must are the nature the strange enough not the the directive the
a additional problem is that addition the natural blatantly the the animals also the partially the the light dependent activity the the people the balance
i think that in the communication the the commission the need the the  not loopholes is proven
to my opinion must the as quickly possible reconsider or the  must be continue
the is also still but the question or the  only just for november must end
in a  northern is the remind the the summer than long vanished
the is logical the  end september to let end such six months after the like that
i am at not fully against the  because there also positive sides the are
i request the commission despite critical to assess or the  still need is
i am the opinion that we the also without  can to but i am not prepared the to see the hot 
on can politicians fortunately not decision take
mrs the president ladies and gentlemen the proposal that we today discuss address the the widening the the regulations on the existing dates and times which the  start and end that like say the the last sunday in march and the last sunday in october to at programmes am   time
i like however first your rapporteur mrs  the i congratulate with the excellent work that they has done and with the report that they has up
you will noticed have that otherwise than the the previous directives the regulations the be proposed the unlimited duration are
the research what the commission in task by according the promise the they the council and the european parliament the the adopt the the eighth directive had given has shown that the regulations broad be behave by the population and by the different sectors
there is however has that there for certain sectors difficulties can the because the fact that the regulations time only for a relatively short period valid are
with particularly the transport but also other sectors questions example to a stable planning because the technical requirements the a role play the the prepare the 
also are there the needs the the manufacturers the computers or electronic tachographs and the the producers the  and agendas
and burden but not least must the repeat the procedures the community and national level a timeconsuming and expensive matter the with relatively short yearly place be prevent
this are all reasons before the adopt the regulations the indefinite duration the way the when has the commission however provisions there to latest five year after the first year the implementation the the directive a report the to to the basis the information the by any member the made
what this subject the am i welcome to can see that the proposal the the commission by the european parliament positive is received
what the tabled amendments the the commission can the find in the amendments and since this the system transparent aim to make and the precautionary stress
what amendment the here can the commission the part which they compulsory any five year a report must the to to not accept
the commission can the however the find in the up the proposals the are between the the conclusions the the report the which in article the referred
the commission can amendment the recital a not accept and the to two reasons the the one on must the scope the the into not limited to be to a few aspects and the the other on refers the proposed amendment the recital a not to a specific article in the directive
however can i you also reassure the commission will the member course time the data for so they all necessary information and data with the to the different sectors the with this subject to make will can organising
the conclude would i like still want say that the proposed directive to i hope quickly will be adopted so the involved sectors not difficulties will affected
thank you mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
clinical experiments with medication for human use
the the item is the recommendation for the second reading a the the commission environment health and consumer on the common position by the council the with the view the the adoption the the directive the the european parliament and the council on the mutual adaptation the the legal and administrative provisions the the member on the application the good clinical practices the the implementation the clinical experiments with medication for human use c cod rapporteur the mr liese
mrs the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues medical research that for patients need is must quickly and without bureaucracy can be allowed the must the ethical borders however absolutely be respected and the  must optimum be protected against abuse
that was the objective the the european parliament the the treatment the this directive on clinical experiments i believe today to should say that we this objective achieved have
during a informal trialogue has the council us previous week informed the most amendments the the commission the committee to can accept the council like the wording the a number passages still adapt but that can be regulated by the compromise the four groups which we tomorrow will vote
the seemed there long the that we the not agree would can be
the different positions in the parliament but also the differences between the member and the different institutions seemed to large
i would everyone the this has involved want thank because we the however with other agree are become my thank therefore the our colleagues the the commission the the council and especially the the french presidency the the council
the compromises the we have closed lead according the european parliament to a enormous improvement the the common position
now is clear that the assent with a clinical test under normal circumstances writing must be given
now is clear that interference in the human material unacceptable are
now the recognised that course clinical experiments the the business not can or like support however important can are and that also this rules must be down
i am especially welcome that we a excellent compromise have found for clinical experiments the people the this not itself valid that can agree
the issue the research the  people has in the member but also in the council the europe here in strasbourg to fierce discussions led
the participants the this legislative were not all same opinion agree
originally wanted the council at not regulation into in the directive and this subject the the member leave
the european parliament has in the first reading decided that such clinical experiments only but allowed are when for any clinical test and for any treatment can be demonstrated that there a directly usefulness from resulting
we have now a compromise found but according i is the not compromise the is simply a good solution to the problem least in this cases the to solve
on the direct usefulness like i still say that we the clinical experiments a distinction must make between the follow the the prescription and the noting research that need is to conclusions to can draw for other patients
that distinction in us report is important
we must also a distinction make between children and  adults
children have a other  and therefore must medication the the children be given also be tested in clinical experiments the children
that happening now often not
children to medication the only but the adults tested are that means that they bad be dealt
with this report want we achieve that children in europe in the future better will be dealt with medicines with less sideeffects the in the right dose be applicable
this have we extremely strict rules down
the rules the we in the commission have down and the the council will accept if the parliament there tomorrow least that agrees what i hope are more than the provisions in the agreement the the council the europe on the bioethics however make they research expressly possible and we find that very important if the least according the rules process
in insofar am i therefore welcome with the compromise that we have closed
with two points am i however not satisfied
in the first reading had we originally a shorter term asked for the permission for clinical experiments also had i hoped that the term the days the the common position as least for authorities would can be reduced
course must a ethical commission the there from experts the this addition their ordinary work do what more time to according i can we however best a little pressure exercise the the bodies so they quickly the the work to
unfortunately was on in the council not compromise to can be found therefore give i there the prefer the to to let vote on the compromise that we with the council have closed and not a long conciliation to launch the end perhaps not agree to a result lead
same applies also for the question or the clinical experiments only but by doctors should be carried or also by others
the parliament remains involved that in all member only doctors clinical experiments should out this matter is to sensitive to the  or  to be left even if they a special training have followed or the biologists or  the perhaps in a laboratory have work but not enough experience with patients have
i must admit that the council also in this respect not the many water the the wine has want do
therefore must we with cement heart agree with this compromise
if we that do to we however still a regulation the guarantees offers for the therapeutic progress also be the interests the the treatment in europe protected more still than to now to
mrs the president gentlemen mr programmes the directive the us today for the second time the treatment the presented is within a very delicate context namely the the the international competition the the area the  the the from the view the the health enormous many the the stake
i think with particularly the the  with this directive the a solution is for the issue the the clinical experiments the parallel in different member and the different places be carried
the common position the the council is doubt a improvement the relation the the proposal and especially also the relation the the first reading the us parliament
we can agree with different points the
we accept example the principle that for the beginning the clinical experiments zones permission is requires the both the ethical commission if the competent authorities the the member
the opinion the the ethical commission is therefore the crucial important this this the first necessary opinion is if there not negative opinion the given must immediately without any further  a beginning be made with the test
we to agreement with the proposals the the council on labelling the the the the test used medicines
there are in the common position however also points the for improvement room are and i believe to my pleasure to have understand that the council prepared is to a number compromises
the first point is the essential important and this must we footing the document the the is to the permission the the participants the clinical experiments
this permission must writing be granted if written permission not possible is because example someone temporary not in the is to write must permission be granted in presence the a witness
that like say that the participant the the informed must are the the circumstances including the test will be done and the the risk programmes the he possibly the he must also know that he the the each at during the test can withdraw without that only pressure the him the exercised
to finally must the and i i is this a point the fundamental important that ensure that optimum protection the is the those the not in the are their permission to to that like say the very weak people children and adults the in legal respect if  must be as
they must directly benefit have the the clinical test
the opinion the a minors must least heard be this account taken must be with certain clinical and psychological characteristics
i i asking the rightly that the experiments not  adults be involved if this   available are
further should  adults only participate the the experiments the the have the their disease the the disease the the cause is the their incompetence
although few differences with the council continue there must i however clear make that the with the adoption the this directive intended result the fruit is the longterm attempts to compromises the the on the both our rapporteur the mr liese the i the i thank for are positive work and are openness if the council the prepared was to cooperation and sensitive for the by the environment in second reading tabled amendments
after what the mr liese us just has said i i good hope that there quickly a agreement can be achieved and a long and end little productive conciliation can be avoid
mrs the president i approve i behind the express the mrs mr the the to the our rapporteur the mr liese for are not indeed attempts to a consensus to achieve
the before directive is very important
they can contribute the the improvement the  research in europe and therefore the the welfare the millions patients
 research is a very delicate sector
the is the because not only to scientific progress but also to ethical and moral issues briefly said to 
since the first reading has us parliament are attention focused the the protection the the people the not in the are informed permission to to for this clinical experiments as children and mental disabled adults
this groups must under the scope the the directive continue the
if the they does from the research to diseases the them specific take
scientific and experimental research is however in certain cases their only hope
we know moreover that in the past very what tragedy programmes are caused because the for adult intended  simply definite to children to deal
also the opposite case can the however arise when namely children not be dealt because the already made specific prescription which they would can be cure not the children is tested
for us is the therefore very important that also this groups the opportunity the is benefit to draw the the progress in the research provided the necessary experiments the very strict and strict conditions be subject
we offer their the opportunity with particularly with the amendments and the is there the full objective and the the child adapted information what for i extremely important is the written informed permission the the parents or the legal representative the exclusion the each financial benefit and control the the protocol by the ethical committees
in this amendments say we also and even two time and not one time that the interests the the treatment always more roads than the the the science and the society
children and disabled are vulnerable people the optimum protection need have banned are here however from the because
the must for this people not all doors the the their hope can give research is as such door and sometimes even the last premises the them still with the life regard
i like still briefly something say on a another i i important point that dealt the in amendment on course clinical experiments
the is the crucial important that the directive account the with this academic research
they must this research not punish this the sometimes very  effects has for patients in many sectors
i think example the research in the framework the the  but there are many other sectors
mrs the president i am welcome that so colleagues clear have made how important the for us is and that is however the central in this debate that we those protect the that the most need have namely children and  people we must guarantee that research without directly usefulness for the  banned the
i like there however also the point that the the group the free european  was the time despite the any the all sides unfortunately also the the current rapporteur in the first reading the amendment had tabled to research the  people without directly usefulness to ban
this had many colleagues time for voted this important debate is according i only but possible thanks that amendment the our group
i repeat that i welcome am that the rapporteur in that respect the mind is changed the have we now according i a good compromise can the
course can any member still further to but this compromise is a type minimum that from that there in the european union a type ethical dumping the because in one member research the  people allowed is and in other member not
i like also again stress that this compromise further is than the agreement on the bioethics the the council the europe we offer a many better protection the the treatment the the important the the treatment itself
i am also welcome that we the managed are to to prevent that the  allowed the
we must clear to that clinical experiments the intended are to through a then however with the material to experiment banned are that would namely a breach are the the human dignity
therefore think i this compromise excellent especially when we remind think that the member even still more rules should impose
the say we very clear that we in europe not ethical dumping allow and that research the  people banned is when the for them not benefit will
the finally like i the council emphatically questions to still agree after to think on us amendment on 
we have proposed to research with  only but to to let when proven is that a other form the assessment the the usefulness impossible is we want namely avoid that research without directly usefulness the done but we want the research the the not prevent
that is the reason for this proposal can you the french presidency the the council remind remind that i a answer the the question expect
mrs the president health is the highest good and must the all possible ways be protected and restore
therefore must the medical science all resources the available have to a high level the protection the the individual and collective health to can guarantee
in despite the all measures to there however still again new diseases and warnings the it the and often can the here with the existing medicines nothing against take the medical community has the duty to modern and efficient methods to seek to this dangers the head to offer
clinical experiments are the however essential the must there only for ensure that this experiments such be done that the dignity and the physical integrity the the involved people not be the
by the legal and administrative differences between the member the not only all problems but the also a competition creating between the pharmaceutical industries the from all power try if first the the market to before with new medicines for the patients
therefore is harmonisation the european level requires
as must the people the the clinical experiments are involved this writing permission have granted in case the mental disabled or people with such spiritual disturbances that they not in the are itself to decide is permission requires the the  or the legal representative
further must the the the tried medicines to expect gains the disadvantages the any sideeffects exceed also must the the necessary released in eight take the participation the children the clinical experiments this is a very sensitive point
i am than also but to speak on the lack the this demand in the compromise the the council only doctors have on the necessary knowledge and experience to the benefits the experiments the right gentlemen to importance and any sideeffects and dangers during the test the head to offer
in the team that the clinical experiments done can course also other the the  involved specialists help
i like to finally the rapporteur the mr liese the i congratulate with are report and him thank for are attempts to the achieve the compromises
mrs the president i like the rapporteur the mr liese the i congratulate and him thank for are excellent report also thank i the commission environment health and consumer for its work
the commission will welcome are if after so efforts by all involved last community harmonisation can be individual the the requirements for implementation the clinical experiments
this is extremely important for the protection the the health
as you know rules the community pharmaceutical legislation that for medication a  need is before they in the trade can be the
for the issue the this licence must the three fundamental criteria be met quality safety and efficiency
the the the two objectives protection the the health and free movement
with the implementation the clinical experiments accordance the principles the good clinical practices can the medication testing the efficiency and safety
for good clinical practices is harmonisation the international level achieved with this office that this guidelines are adopted in the framework the the international  which representatives session have the the european union the united states and japan
this this guidelines however not legal binding are be they in the member the strong different way applied
the the difficulties for both the participants the clinical experiments if the business that this experiments in the european union like out
therefore has the commission in september a framework proposed the on the article the the treaty order the proposing for clinical experiments in the european union to can harmonise
the commission has to account to can the with the position the the european parliament its proposal in april amended
the have the most by the parliament tabled and by the commission adopted amendments their up found the commission has the fully understanding for the ensure the the parliament that with are amendments especially a optimum protection the the the participants the clinical experiments the not in the are permission this to to to know children and  
this the population adapted medication absolutely need has must the for in the possibility the clinical experiments under full protection the the participants
thanks indepth work and a perfect cooperation between the european parliament the council and the commission could a compromise to the be the which account the taken with all the the item having aspects and often different positions are together
the commission accept all amendments the the compromise
this answer the the by the commission intended objectives to know protection the the health protection the the participants the clinical experiments berger the clinical experiments in the european union and a the global competitive pharmaceutical industry
to finally can the commission the amendments the the compromise to and with accept
they vote also in with the amendments and
the commission vote in principle also in with the amendments and the amendments and must they however the the hand point
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
mrs the president i am welcome that the commission says that they amendment in principle can accept
i would however like the the council want hear or he the also agrees would that can
the council is clear not the plan you a answer to give mrs but perhaps can you this still for tomorrow at contact into with the representative the the council
tomorrow the here because on voted
programmes the the area the the health
the the item is the report a the the mr trakatellis behalf the commission environment health and consumer on the proposal for a decision the the european parliament and the council on extension the certain the decisions no ec no ec no ec  no ec and no ec the community action programmes the the area the the health and to amendment the this decisions com c cod
mrs the president i must clear make that i very dissatisfied am on the fact that the commission this proposal to extension the the six action programmes the the area the the health as late the the parliament has presented this is really not few justify for
if this programme programmes be cut must the work the the now established networks and many projects be any the codecision for the force the the new  will certainly not the december are completed
that is however the date which four the the six programme programmes expiry therefore is the absolutely necessary this programme programmes to extended with in first body a year and possibly a second year if meantime the new action still not the force is become
i i therefore agreement with the proposal the the rapporteur to speeding the the procedure let we with a agreement between the council and the commission on the necessary budget see to prevent that two readings necessary are
i hope that we in the future not again faced will be with a such delay very certainly when the to such important sectors if the health is
mrs the president first must i clear make that the programme programmes which extension the asked the is the to four programme programmes for a  training and two programme programmes for a oneyear training directly the the with the new  that currently in the environment the dealt
unfortunately is this new programme for the period still not ready and to the the late regard will the still the just take before the in force can act therefore was the logical to questions to extension the the previous programme programmes
this concern  aids by pollution caused diseases and monitoring the infectious diseases this are therefore general about very important programme programmes for the health
extension of is necessary to to prevent that there suddenly a gap the in the implementation the programme programmes for health
we should also not forget that the this obtained acquis community included will be in the new programme that currently the started the and therefore is extension completely justified
thanks this agreement can we a second reading avoid and this programme programmes without only adjournment continue we have agreed to as the commission has asked the four programme programmes with two year to extended which the this necessary appropriations however per year be allocated
if than meantime the new  the adopted and the force the will extension with a second year not more need are nor if the this intended appropriations if the new programme after a year however still still not the start if are has what i doubt and very the extension need is can we the money for the second year use
there is therefore agreement achieved not only on the extension with one year the the two programme programmes the in december end but also on the amount the amount change not the is even light reduced the relation the what the commission initially had asked
i i have we quickly and excellent worked
i believe even to should say that we a new working have introduced for the issues the under the codecision the
in place the the to wait to after long time historical can be have we in fact the from the the historical i like the european commission the council and the committees the the parliament this method like recommend
the is many better the from the the the area to towards and far possible try to to even if be a second reading need if will to are is the than already far enough to quickly decisions to can take
with particularly thank i however my mr programmes the the environment for the remarkable concord and the rapid progress the have we can prevent that there a vacuum creating in the 
i hope the much i that we just as quickly quickly with the new  and same method apply by quickly to work can we demonstrate that the european integration where we as often the mouths the are have not something abstract is and not only issues the foreign policy and defence the
integration means a whole series the 
can you the a integrated european union proposals without convergence the the area the example health and education
i i make we also here gradually the progress
we know although that health a competence is the the member but the treaties to also the european commission a large responsibility in the into for the health the the european citizens
rightly continue we here than also for fight and with this programme programmes the a the to convergence given
the european citizens will many benefit have the actions the the area the the health and therefore is convergence here a good matter
we must however the the that there something not good work in the european union we must now haste on it a bridge we between two programme programmes if the a surprise is that the programme programmes the in would expiry also indeed expiry
i i can we as the mr trakatellis already said not play with the health the the patients the the our aid wait we can nor play with the nongovernmental organisations the the money the the community need have to the health the ground in practice to can to
the is more general about high time that the member amount the european union more ability to give the this rightly supranational area and a  budget the available to to diseases know because not borders
with particularly must the however in a framework the specific actions not disregard under the pretext that a new both must be the
even if example the fight the aids not more in is must this a priority continue this dramatic disease is still long the world not from very certainly not in the future countries
to finally like i say that with a future european strategy an must be to integration the the health in all other community policies so a end can be made the the current lack the coherence the form one million from for  and its hand for a billion subsidy the the 
mrs the president our group supports the excellent report the the mr trakatellis and the work the the environment
we believe as the mr trakatellis rightly has said that there a lack is the forecasts to the current programmes further to can out
when all european citizens burden have the illnesses with common causes food work and other affairs is the logical that the important the common european programmes for fight and prevention the such problems and for stage and joint action still greater the
therefore is the to hope that there for such programmes more money the allocated
precisely the this level is according us the lack the guidance the the on the the european union the council and the commission felt the their cuts the the budget because they the ceiling that the current rules allow not wish to increase affected actions if this the consequences
also have we appreciation for the comment in the report the the mr trakatellis that the balance between the current programmes and actions must be miserly
also must we account the with the fact that both prevention if promotion and monitoring still important be therefore must there also more important the be granted and would there also more money for allocated must be
to finally are we the opinion that we in the future repeat must see to prevent the situations which the commission not flexible enough can action to time a beginning to make with the renewal the the policy that lack the flexibility think i a worrying matter
many organisations the the this policy involved are have already the the alerted drawn and the problem would than also last a solution must to
mrs the president the extension the the community  to december can certainly count the my support
the extension the certain  to the end the will million euro to costs
that means that there community action can be taken the the area the the  information education and training the action for  the community action in the with the prevention the aids and certain other infectious diseases and the prevention the drug
i am the opinion that the european institutions with particularly the european commission and the european parliament more ability must to to the  within the european union to promote
by the community action in the with the prevention the aids is the number people within the european union that this appalling disease take certainly already considerably reduced
also will i i strong make for more money for the dehp in the union
the is absolutely necessary that here more money for the allocated so we last can find which cancer the caused and  can cure
the plans in the with the prevention the drug must not only at are the the means but also the all other areas within the european union
according international organisations as europol to in fact still more drugs the union within
the fight the a end must make the the international drug and the the imports the drugs to the union will than also the next years still fully struggle must be
the irish authorities know a very managed programme the    and lloyds fund which facilities and services for young in regions be up
the programme address the the areas with a considerable drugs or where a such problem danger to the
this is a area that can be consideration in the context the the new community  that soon will to are
i am are praise on the rapporteur and the report
mrs the president to the the the trakatellis on the extension the the existing european  programmes like i my concern express on the direction which the european policy the the area the the health the development
the principles for european health can we read in article the the treaty the amsterdam the action the the community a supplement is the national policy
this action includes the fight the large threats the the health
also like i point the the subsidiarity what means that  tasks by the member done must to be
i i is there the last time however there the unique the health if relevant integral issue for europe while this development contrary is with the treaty
european health the only relevant if there there is the a crossborder nature or if member a certain task not only can out
examples of are legislation on the crossborder movement the bodies organs and blood the human origin and the programme for drugs
since the mentioned examples the member other need have am i in the cases for a joint european approach
the the fight the problems as cancer aids and drug is a such approach not need
the added the relation the the efforts the member is not particularly large
certainly what the information and information is the level the the member to prefer over the european level
the european union would for  more can do for the countries where even the care imperfect is
also can relatively simple diseases of lack the money and other resources not dealt be
also am i concerned on the fact that in soon to deal new proposals the different  the the european union the the item to
possible be this national systems the discussion the or in the future even the what i a undesirable development think
conclusion mrs the president must i say that the developments in the sector health in the european union i to far to
health is national policy and that must the continue
i am therefore not for  programmes the if  used can be to national policy the to really while the now present programme programmes hardly added have over the efforts the the member
i like the parliament with particularly the members the the commission environment health and consumer and especially the rapporteur the mr trakatellis you thank for their tremendous efforts to this proposal in one reading and in record adopted to to
the is a example that late see how there achieved can be when all institutions good with other work
the text the today the approved on the extension the six  is a reflects the what informal between the institutions agreed is
the commission can the than also find in all amendments the the mr trakatellis to the has the
i i understand that the council also in principle that has given the are approval
the extension is to two reasons important
first can the a number important  continue be and can the favour objectives be achieved
the second offers they us the necessary breathing which we the discussions on our proposals for the new  can prosecute
the one point like i you reassure
the work that in the longer programmes and fact in all current  must to be carried will at are the the preparation the a number core the in the framework the the new programme will place
within the framework the the individual programming will the favour  the this needs be adapted
i hope that the text the now for you is after vote by the parliament the december by the  will be adopted
the debate is closed
the vote take wednesday to at place
status the the victims in the 
the the item is the report a the mrs cerdeira mr behalf the commission freedoms and rights the the citizens justice and home affairs on the initiative the the portuguese republic for a framework on the status the the victims in the  c cns
mr the president the the first place like i the portuguese presidency congratulate with are initiative that in my view then the extremely correct way is continue by the french presidency
ladies and gentlemen as you know life we in a society where the crossborder movement constantly increasing
that movement has a truly huge extent adopted the in other times unthinkable would are been
if example enough the that to point that in the year in the european union more than million people the border the the country where they live exceeded have to the to a other member to really
the european union and the relative the the internal market mean that there a area without borders the created where the free movement the goods people services and capital under article the the treaty the the european community guaranteed must are
already this factors have ensure taken that the course is that daily millions people the borders the the country where they live exceed to to a other member to travel or this to to live or work the factors have individual their work done but have together also a effect had
economic and political given will this situation the medium and long term very many positive consequences have for the  citizens are there however also negative implications the linked
one of is the risk the victims to be the a crime in the member where the live or in a other member the crime can absolve the  to in some cases action the terrorism
incomprehensible enough is the european union however to now to not in the been adequate formulas to develop to united the scourge to combat they know not national borders because the member still still locked are within the fifteen national borders the their legal
in the european union does the the this at the paradox for that the borders for the free movement the goods people services and capital be lifted while the fifteen borders the police and criminal level continue existence same throw the member difficulties the the the eliminate the the borders
this situation has takes consequences for the european citizens the the free on the territory the the european union they
when the the unfortunate fact happens that a citizens the victims the the a crime in a other member than where he are fixed residence has than is that for him a very belatedly  he is than defenceless because the inability the the member a real european legal to create
therefore must each victims the a crime what are fixed residence or nationality also is the guarantee have that are rights be respected he must there certainly the can are right dealt and quickly and distance compensation the to be he has this if each human an right the
the treatment must he to to the just in what member he the victims the the a crime
therefore can the there not the us the victims the crime a real common status to to for all member
the guarantee the a common  in all member is a objective the this initiative
i believe that also stressed must be that the european  always attention has spent the and invested in the criminal both the the level the prevention if the the area the programmes and measures for the reintegration and the action the the criminal
this is the first initiative that special attention paying the the victims the victims the central
this is a innovative and in certain sense a revolutionary initiative for the its with victims
the is doubt a new part the the european system which for the first a own legal status the the victims recognised the the not as to now the case was is secondary the the crime
in as such case be the problems and its by a sum the negative circumstances greater and complicated the are the usual and still again repeated negative circumstances the the  the the victims lack the communication by ignorance with the language lack the information the the are fate left be lack the protection the a number affairs which any member in are own system notion
also to a adequate answer to give the the needs the this victims is there therefore the international level in the during the years legislation made for the defence the the rights and interests the the victims
the this at like i only two aspects the this initiative the international level all the first mention i the european treaty no the the council the europe on the compensation the victims the violent the november
although the a important treaty is and a compulsory reference in europe was the the september by the next member the the european union still not ratified austria belgium greece ireland italy portugal and spain
a another international initiative is the statement the the united nations on the fundamental the area for victims the crime and power the the general sitting with its resolution the november has approved
ladies and gentlemen the on the the previous and result  the the remits in the fourth indent the article the the treaty the the european union which the objective the formulated the union to maintain and to develop if a area the freedom safety and justice with guaranteed free movement the people must we see to achieve that the area the freedom safety and justice real access to the judge assures so the citizens all in the union a adequate form the protection enjoy
to the reason will the europe the the citizens not sense have if we the advance not under more the necessary measures take the account the with the rights the victims the crime and the rights strengthen the must the approach the the one on global are and all rights and interests the the victims include and the the other on from community view lead to the mutual adaptation the the legislation the the fifteen member
everyone with including the the nationals the third countries the the victims are become the a crime in a member the the european union must right dealt be
the european union can not accept that people a different treatment to already to according their nationality or the member where they the victims are become the a crime
there there not doubt on that the form the discrimination completely unacceptable is
the conclude like i say that this  a important step forward is the the construction the a european criminal area although the area still incomplete and limited will are the is a answer the the real needs the very many european citizens the if victims the a crime outside the member where they their usual residence have to now to almost not few protection have were
if positive elements the this initiative like i the definition the the understanding victims and the approval the measures stress the inherent are the the attention the the victims world must be given
because already this reasons are the most amendments in this report formulated with if objective the rights the the victims the a crime to recognise and to respect and account to the with are interests and specific circumstances
short the victims the a crime must the guarantee have that he minimum right the dealt are dignity can retain right has the the provide and received the information access has to the judge and in eligible is for immediate full and real compensation the the ago damage
rapporteur for opinion behalf the commission legal affairs and internal market
the mr the president ladies and gentlemen in the made commission legal affairs and internal market have two issues a decisive role played the the treatment the this proposal
the first question was or there fact the a legal for was
if rapporteur was i the opinion agree that the initiative although very valuable was but that there in the european union and for the relations between the union and the member unfortunately now once rather clear rules there on the distribution the the powers
if rapporteur think i that the  and the way which the criminal persecution place according the treaty not under the competence the the union the but by the member must be regulated
unfortunately has our commission in this specific case the not in my proposal can find but if rapporteur i i the my opinion
the second important aspect was the issue the the into the a specially the video
you can the the still the the debate on the di  remind that we already what longer ago have held
this subject was when already highest controversial
the legal commission was with the rapporteur the opinion that a such  in a rule not distort instrument must are therefore have we the paragraph this from the text removed
i question you to the the further treatment this account to the
apart of am i very satisfied with this proposal
the would however better are been to the to let deal where the home should namely the the national legislator the this very good would can decide
we need not everything the european level to regulate if that the intention was been would in the treaty are that the union a universal competence has
that the there however not in
therefore must we still agree good give or the sensible is to for this initiative to vote
president i think that the the very large important is that there indeed a number minimum rights for victims already on the national across guaranteed be
that is what this report necessary
we was behalf the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities a opinion the the commission the committee
for us was very important that the specific situation the women but also the other vulnerable victims in the report are impact was
if i say other vulnerable victims than think i example also the minors and children but the not not limited to continue to that
there are also in our society other groups the very vulnerable are if the comes the violence
i think the 
i think the immigrants etc the than however a very vulnerable victims are
what have we asked for this group the people
the first we have said that the people the very vulnerable are absolutely respect must to
i think example the the specific situation the women and children the victims are the sexual violence or the physical violence within the parity
the is for them the large important that if there a process held the this indeed with closed doors would can held be such that there as less possible publicity given the the the victims the usually itself ashamed are on the fact that they victims are
because as far is the course in our society
i think example that the for beaten women the large important is all information to can to on where they to to can to where they appropriate housing can find and where they the a secret to can into
the is also the large important that the police and the investigating a special training to
i am in my own country very strong are been with this problem when i in the government was
i i noticed how little prepared and trained the is from this two bodies both the police if the investigating to people the example victims are the sexual violence the a respect way the to catch to them to investigate to a separately local for them to for example for  women the investigated must be
to them not to investigate in a local where everyone apparent
the is absolutely the large important that the relation the this group the people this specific victims indeed a number affairs for be
the is happened in the report
i am there very grateful for that the commission the amendments the the commission rights the the women has adopted and we will than also the report support
mr the president best colleagues the report that we today deal follows continue from a portuguese initiative and makes part from the a package measures to a area the freedom safety and justice to create and as a specific answer to give the the daily ensure the the european citizens
the the tackle the judicial problems to we often to many time the the criminal aspects the  those the the crime combat the  the comes and even the demands the those the the the legal power work
perhaps have we to little time spent the the victims the often the underlying party are in this world
this initiative address the the a three essential aspects the right the the victims the information the access to the judge and the right the compensation
indeed the this decision the the first place the protection and the respect the the rights the the victims in the process to promote that applies with particularly for the simplify the the access to the judge and the courts the right the legal information and the promote and protect the the right the compensation
a legal that the mutual adaptation the the national legislation for the status the the victims possible makes is essential
there are different elements the certainly for improvement or even correction in eligible to but the is however important that we for this rather balanced framework vote
we can indeed not seriously speak the the europe the the citizens if we not account the with the rights the the victims
the must there special attention be given as mrs smet already has said the certain categories as minors foreigners victims the sexual crime and victims the terrorist actions
same must there special training to for those the in directly contact to with the victims
also must the necessary measures guaranteed are so the victims economic given the premises the their normal life can left also must they if need in eligible to for assistance and psychological medical and social aid
to finally would i the rapporteur mrs cerdeira mr want congratulate with the done work and with the improvements the they the the treatment in the commission public freedoms in the proposal has made
i forward i also on the improvements in the opinions the mrs smet and the mr lehne
i like the emphasis to the the teamwork that possible was in the commission public freedoms i am this grateful for
i would wish that a similar consensus in the plenary sitting possible was
the few amendments the we have tabled concern especially the legal accuracy and our view that the services for victims not only or the prefer public must are
the services the to to a human approach is often the best experience gained with private  and other nongovernmental organisations
on the whole taken welcomes the ppe the report the mrs cerdeira mr that we already in the commission have approved
mr the president i like the important the the portuguese initiative emphasise the the dealt in the report the mrs cerdeira where the parliament now on debated and is to different reasons a important initiative
the the first place because there a step forward the the in the direction the the area the freedom safety and justice the in tampere is agreed the is difficult that objective to achieve because the the the many national regulations and the opposition the the member lot
they can free view in the union but when they the victims be the a crime be they faced with the barriers the the different legal in all respects is the access to the other legal difficult the citizens be there further by against while the criminals precisely benefit have the the differences
to finally is this vote important because the parliament the opportunity has the legislative considerably to improve the improvements be the the hand done in the excellent report the mrs cerdeira and supported by the commission public freedoms
according i is the most however that the last also the the level the the union aware that the way the the interventionists the crime must be review
basis the the right principle that  prevent must be has the the to now to limited to the guarantee the the monopoly the the penalties the the perpetrators the is however forget that the the task the the authorities not end all the world questions victims to justice
with the adopt the this report the the european union a first answer the the to now defenceless question to justice
mr the president i i extremely positive the the portuguese initiative and the excellent report the mrs cerdeira and i like its thank for the open approach which they the parties further to other has try to to
the liberal group is the opinion that there a very good report from the in the commission pursued discussion to or is has and the the vote will we the amendments the the commission than also support
we give not support the further amendments the the european party or the european social with exception the amendment
we find that a appeal the member to the european treaty the november on the compensation the victims the violent to sign more in the legislative with than in the report on the framework
the is clear that we the the achieve the the area the freedom safety and justice which in tampere was for legal support the crossborder affairs need have
from my own constituency know i the case the a assaulted the by are employer in netherlands was  and the not proceedings against him could event to are right to to
amendment is than also extremely important
we know also that we there the from must can to that a victims the arbitrary what nationality the same way dealt the if a victims with the nationality the the country which the violation place
i know someone in my constituency whose car in brussels was reopened and the had affected that the belgian police there nothing the wanted know
therefore will we our support give the amendment
we must there certainly the can are that the rights the the citizens be protected and that the special needs the the minorities be recognised the both conditions the under other in amendment met
in my own constituency is ever a swedish family attacked the act was continue from xenophobia those the the attack the their conscience had thought namely with germans the do to have
i would the agree want know or the for them in britain just as easy was to their right to to if the in their own country been would are
the the a or other way i i this as my doubts on
mr the president the liberals give than also their support the this report
we are the opinion that the a important step is the way to the create the a european legal area a step where millions citizens benefit the will have
president first and especially like i also mr cerdeira congratulate with its speech and its report
victims should not duplication victims be first the the crime and then still agree the the system
the most right the the victims during the way the the  is therefore the right heard to be during the 
this is also the fundamental important
this the quoted in many international documents on victims the crimes and the is essential that the victims access the to are own irving
the is also in the important the the victims that the matter quickly tried the since a slow way can lead to a second still greater 
victims the sexual offences would also not longer compulsory must are to repeatedly to testify
i think that in the with children the the victims are been the sexual abuse  also the very useful would can are
therefore is a debate concerning still not closed
the is extremely important that on the the nature the the crime specialised aid for the as also mr smet has exactly
important the is that a number prejudice the matter be halted with particularly the certain seriously the on the country to country a another weight granted
also the the that the the notification the the victims discriminatory in the
member would compulsory must be to the up the special police for victims the crimes
the is further also important that there a legal there and a harmonisation the the measures for the protection the victims
the study carried by an  in the framework the the grotius offers this the necessary wergens
the useful experience the regarding existing measures in certain member available is can a important role play the the harmonise the a common package
such initiative is also a first step to the prevention to do
but given the the fact that the organised crossborder crime increasing would the initiative must lead to a common culminate the european and international level
in pending the a harmonised instrument for crossborder protection the victims would the member and the countries in cooperation with the ngos the protection the victims must improve and if this justified is look under what conditions the victims right has the support for return to are country the origin or the time residence as belgium example a status much the victims the trafficking
the compensation the the victims must priority to the the payment the the fine and the damages the the the
the member must that to to see that the mediators from are from all sections the the society men both if women that they a sound insight have in the local culture and communities
the is in this framework also the important that the those the family the the victims the a discreet and professional way the the informed be the the the facts if they this wish also the the necessary support can count and that they not everything must know through the press
mr the president the portuguese initiative for the protection the the victims during the hearing is very urgent and has our support i like the rapporteur with its work congratulate
according i has they there good the done a unacceptable paradox clear to make the the one on is there because the europe without borders with free movement the goods and people that the way is to the monetary union which the economies and the financial systems the the member incompatible and the the other on the europe with fifteen very different 
the the one on is there the potential the million people the from name the the united europe be encouraged to travel and to work in other member but if they the victims be the a crime the injustice than there europe not more the as very sosracisme european citizenship disappears if on for the such and the citizens the rights
he see the faced with a foreign authorities the him often hostile observers is not information the many problems creates and any damage not 
how often be we members not viewed to questions to to on such cases and the commission the us than still again the answer that they the not can interfere in the national systems even not if there there is the  injustice
only already in the last months are i two cases presented
the first case the two italian pilots the alitalia president  and   the the a  in france under still not place circumstances to the life are has
there are six year has and after many problems and growth  wait the families still still the justice and the information on the cause the that disease accident and the possible responsible
the second case the a greek student   the year ago in rome killed is the a terrorist attack the the red has
the perpetrated   was identified and condemned but  to the abroad
italy has france where  free citizens is repeatedly to the extradition the this multiple murderer asked to him last are punishment in italy to let are
well we wait still still the answer
together with the euro is this common status the the victims the a crime than also welcome so there a real european legal can be created
mr the president we welcome the development the the position the the victims will strengthen
initially were the most that against but currently are we the most with other agree what i a good matter think
i welcome the proposal the portugal to to the position the the victims also in the  to strengthen also already respect i in legal respect the positions the the mr lehne just to the has the fully
people the the victims are the a crime while they use make the the free movement should not duplication victims be in the sense that they worse be dealt
irrespective what type crime the the
the is to the strengthen the the position the the victims but that is not possible without the also to have on measures for prevention
the best way to victims to help is ensure to ensure that there not crime committed be the best way to crime to prevent is probably information
measures the prevention the crime must however also at are the the fight the the organised crime
victims must the the informed are the their rights and the the aid the they can to
the most member offer the victims a form the first aid
sometimes have travellers other and perhaps more aid need than the local population
that can lie aid are linguistic aid or aid the a series other areas
the can for a foreign victims difficult are to the distance the legal procedures to follow the clearly for the that this special measures for need are
the victims must always the the first place to
prevent must be that the perpetrated the the first place is to are and the is than also worrying that in certain member the trend there to cases to  to a confrontation between the perpetrated and the victims to prevent
a such development can i not support
crimes must be resolved if that not happening is that the the long term a threat for the democratic system
who like there participate the the democratic process with particularly the elections if are problem fully aside the the
in my country rising the number cases the maltreatment and only something more than the the cases the resolved
this percentage is to low
crimes are not accidents
a punishment means also respect for the victims
we can not from the the principle that a individual always responsible is for are own action or the state or the eu
the country must the full responsibility the the take for are failure in the protection the the victims
therefore am i welcome that the rapporteur this report has developed and i support the the i
i like its thank for its contribution the the increase the the agreement on the victims in the member
mr the president the a at which the achieve the a european area without internal borders already far progress is is the important as your rapporteur has stressed to not over to to the the thousands the each year the victims the a crime be when they the the the territory the the european union move
they are the often in a difficult situation because they far the house are and the system or the language the the country which the crime place not know
the decision as that is proposed by portugal and the supported by the french presidency is a first step in the process the eu the reflection the the situation the the victims
the commission is welcome with this the
the issue the the situation the victims the crime in europe was for the first mentioned in the action the vienna and was included in the conclusions the the european council the tampere
also was the the subject the a communication the the commission the july
the proposals the in this communication were done to the standards with the to and the responsibility for the victims to improve were partly included in the decision that presented was by the portuguese presidency and that today the you the presented
i am very welcome with the work that mrs cerdeira mr your rapporteur with the to this document has done
the was the subject the solid discussions in the council
as you has noticed includes the decision three different types measures the first be there obtaining in down with the to the rights the the victims the second require specific rules that there account the taken with the individual situation the the people the victims are the a violation in a member the not the member is where they originally from to and the third be countries to encouraged measures to develop for victims
with a number provisions are we especially very welcome example with the possibility for victims to a complaint in to must in their residence if the complaint not can be tabled in the country where the violation place
the commission has not only objection against the majority the the amendments the by the rapporteur are proposed
i like however your attention questions for three points
a number amendments has the the the official languages the the european union and regulating the right the victims to in a the this languages to communicate
this regulation seems here however not the are place
the is important that the victims on information can have in a language the he or they understand
in certain cases is that perhaps not a 
in other cases can the necessary information perhaps be obtained in a language the the union the not the language the the victims is
the is than also guide not to a language the the union to refer but a more attitude the to take and the victims the right to give the access to the necessary information in a language the they understand
in certain cases would this can content that victims a system to their available to
the second the in amendment the that member victims the right guarantee to if they that want in the member to who where the point place when remain for a correctly way the the point necessary is
this is a very interesting provision the however more indepth research requires the the european legislation with the to the asylum in and the immigration to the union the inhabitants the outside the eu
therefore is this text removed from the version as this in the council is discussed
the commission intend currently a specific text on this important subject the to to to the victims to protect and in a number cases inventories possible to make
the third asking the document the member a green  to open where victims at per day and in all languages the the union the institutions for victims can achieve
this is with right a good idea to mention because the european citizens the during are journey the the territory the the union victims the the a crime as in specific terms can affected what the added gentlemen is the legislation the european level
the framework is in this the however not the appropriate instrument and also is the application quite complicated
is the proposal that in all member same no for emergency must be introduced to similar the the no the the firemen or the the police
is the the intention that there a centre the european level is that the the clock available is to information to give on the opportunities for victims
must there in any member a body to
the commission wishes the feasibility for a such project continue to to
they is intends support to give the the up the a european network which the national bodies for victims can be together so the victims the right aid is can to with particularly if they not this live where the violation has place
the idea the a green  will in this context be investigated
in this stage is the perhaps better to a opposition with the institutions for victims the to to and not in a document the principle the a green  the to take that probably however not future has
the decision which you today a decision the is a first step to reflection the the situation the victims the european level
as i just i said working the commission the the the the in its communication the july made proposals the the adoption the specific measures for victims with particularly through the proposed support the the european forum for institutions the the deal with victims
what the compensation the the victims the on this subject will the commission next year a green produce
i am very welcome with the positive response the the parliament the this first document on such important subject has given and i hope than also that the area the freedom safety and justice the we the the build are our citizens support can offer in situations the often difficult to accept are
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
the sitting the to closed
the the mr the president morning early was there a large problem our staff if not with the bus the hotel  to here  although that if since year without problem happening
i like who protest we had a bus for five members while the staff to late the the work would are has
that is a stupid regulation in place the a bus for five had the than two car programmes can use with two drivers in place the one
our quaestors must that example the bureaucracy have however i request urgent this a end to make and the the members possible to make their staff that to the work to take
the mr posselt we will your comments transfer the the college the quaestors so this to own free on this issue certainly and all members the the informed brings the are decision
approval the the minutes the the previous sitting
the the minutes the the sitting the yesterday are distributed
not any
mr the president i wanted only report that i last forget am the attendance to signs
the we take of knowledge
the minutes be approved
vote on the request to urgent
the the floor is the the mr varela president the the commission fisheries the are opinion wishes to give
varela suanzescarpegna ppede president the the commission fisheries the es mr the president i like that point that the commission fisheries decided has to this request to urgent not to support this we only the november in knowledge are the the the proposal the the commission when the for us already to late was to the still the the agenda to places
therefore have we this proposal not in treatment can take according the urgent as us is asked
however will we everything in the work to to ensure to ensure that we during the  partsession the next year on this issue can debate
the thank you mr varela
this there not other speeches more are is the floor now the mrs the commissioner
mr the president ladies and gentlemen in the regulation on the measures for the area which the treaty on future multilateral cooperation the fishing in the north atlantic the application is the that the provisions on the implementation the the measures only for the year apply
the council could the when not on a longer regulation agree be the regulations are than also the the end the this year the
if the amendment the this regulation delay take means this that there from january not legal for the  the the european union in the international waters the the north atlantic more there
the whole system and the regional organisations would the be weakened
that system the if exemplary as we should therefore not efforts from the way to to the further to develop and to strengthen
the commission supports therefore the request to urgent the the council and request the members than also the in to case
the the floor is again the the mr varela president the the commission fisheries the commission the committee
mr the president i regret the the very that the commission this not earlier account has taken and that they us not time has informed so our commission this the the work had can to
moreover will the mentioned international measures the force continue because the to a international treaty is
they will therefore not by the postponement be affected
also will we as said during the partsession the january hope our approval can attach the the before proposal
the fact that we now the the last at this request to urgent to presented is how than also regrettable this we because during the whole year the time have had to this proposal for a regulation in treatment to take
to my idea would the institutions in this case the commission more to work must to so this sitting the proposals activity under view the and as in the opportunity is to a rapporteur to appoint the proposal to study amendments in to must on to debate in the commission and they the the plenary for to to already this acts would now must be done in a few plenary sitting what impossible is
the after we have listened to the speeches the the commissioner and the the president the the commission fisheries am i the request to urgent the vote the you for
the parliament rejected the request to urgent
budget
mr the president mrs the president the the council mrs the commissioner ladies and gentlemen first thank i the president the the council the the sensible and our way and often without the support the its mr programmes with the parliament has negotiated i thank also the commissioner the the european interests for or behind the scenes ever from the view has lost
finally thank i all members the the decisive moments their support not have refused already were they often a other opinion agree
if the that the was were they solidarity and very they the position the the parliament i thank their this all
without the cooperation the everyone would we us now not in this free sleeper really obtain situation are the see there going to from that nothing the european parliament still will prevent thursday the budget the the european union for the year good to approve
the president the the committee has i said that the the first time is that during a conciliation a agreement between the council and the parliament the achieved
good as
money can a bad master but also a good service are
we members by the people elected members have to this  action
we are not still again on principles started
we had ex not budgetary objectives which we us policy subordinate have made
we wanted a means sensitively and logical budget which we our political obligations can fulfil and aid can offer the who our aid need has
as have we in the night the the november with the council a agreement on the cornerstones the a little  but the very sensitively budget achieved
the is in each case sensible the fight against the unemployment in europe not the to give we have than also time again said that the each political level both local regional national if european measures must be taken
in the next five year will we the the european budget million euro allocate to the employment to promote by the small and mediumsized companies to support
with the implementation the the actions as the in the charter for the central and small be described and with the support for the traffic and small the the area the the use the new technologies seems the i that we the instrument have found to new jobs to create
the agreed amount the million euro is the times the what the commission in the draft the budget had proposed with the frontloading the million euro in the next year must we a good start can take
the committee the the plenary sitting for the reserves the the first reading both the treaty reserve in the category the the foreign policy if the reserve for the administrative expenditure free to give
we have always said that we the reform the the commission want support and that we accept that new posts be created and that there a early arms is we want that however not deserve do
the few the our conditions is already met
the commission has a report presented which the existing obligations be analysed and the strategic approach for the state the the payment the proposed
we have past tuesday in a trialogue the last hand the the common statement the the council and the parliament the
we are agreed that the commission for middle next year a report must present on the progress the the gagauz the the existing obligations the implementation the the programme programmes and the simplification the the  and on the function the the comitology the progress the the implementation the the reforms and further information on the  the the supplement programmes in category i the only few parts the the common statement
the commission must now quickly the the work to
apart the what small conflicts the the council with are second reading has caused or has continue will our second reading not many problems more that that is especially because we prepared are agree in to vote the payments with less than to let increase what for the council a very important objective is
the will in the first place the in first reading imposed reserve the the structural disappear and will for the community initiatives the how than also again in the budget must be included less appropriations be included
the has also the second note the changes the the commission which after recent calculations for category now approximately million euro less the proposed us course help
the note the changes and the approval that by the parliament are certainly also for the council a good matter in the note is because also there the a surplus the to estimated million euro the the current budget that for immediately the the revenue can be made
what us during the whole budgetary the most has been was the financing the us foreign policy
the was clear that us financial prospect for category since the war in the balkans not longer precisely was
the commission had therefore also a revision with million euro proposed the council has the who own opposition
for the council was that immutable that was last year already as and also this year was that the case
the council the the the the financial perspectives there must not the be any
the council has the financial perspectives to the the picture the the just mentioned  to continue to a bad master made
we have the council therefore the million euro the the flexibility must reducing if that not amendment the the financial perspectives is
we have now million euro more while we million euro more need had
that is however sufficient to to finance what us the important seems namely the democratisation and reconstruction in the western balkans the is to in total million euro with including the million euro for serbia
the our other priorities the the area the the foreign policy have we not further let do
we can the cooperation with the baltic region and our  finance and for meda have we million euro more than the council had proposed
as have we for the budget the a solution found
the solution the weak places in the political and budgetary planning at which not account the taken with the fact that needs during different years continue there
for multiannual needs have we a good guarantees need
now will we during the next budgetary course again for same difficulties to to are
i wish my successor if general rapporteur the the parliament and the belgian presidency the the council in the second half the next year many pleasure with the negotiations
from own experience know i how difficult the is all groups the the parliament the one line to the
from discussions know i however also that the still many difficult is a tenable position the the council to formulate a mandate to to and from the national egoism a mistake and tenable european decision to 
as the the summit the nice still but agree is has applies that not only for the budget
as is there again a year over we questions us the how we the council to can to sensible to act and the a bad master a good service to make
mr the president mrs the president the the council mrs the commissioner ladies and gentlemen first join i i course the the the words the thank the mrs haug the all staff members and commission with the council i i the what difficult
i i the honour the small budgets to should defend and the is the procedure relatively clear on who the last floor has
you could us in nice than also relatively bad deal but if you with the to the european court the justice not everything again the are it had the what the parliament had done while you good was that we that this week would correct had we very what paper can save and as the the protection the the environment can contribute the this point had the council for the parliament what  can are
i i that work however like done i like because a strong european court the justice that are work can do and in the particularly the behind the the area the translation can state
if the council what more had want admit had we this already in october together for can ensure
i i unfortunately enough but little time been and must i therefore to few comments to also for the rapporteurs is the budget because more than half minute worth
we must internal be how we the the area the the promotion transparent procedures can develop
the am i very that the european court the justice and the court but also the economic and social committee and the committee the the region programmes the on their promotion discussions and a transparent the merit specific procedure want develop so not longer the cambodia but the personal achievement the decisive criterion is
i think that we the the the right rail are if branch the the budgetary the in this case even if budgetary this the council here not the role plays the will we ensure ensure that we in the future the the right rail continue
we will us in the parliament itself agree must ask or our budget still the the criteria the  and clarity meets
i like also agree clear say that we in this parliament a number  posts have which we year after year decades millions euro can save
we must us therefore agree ask or we our own budget still the the the right way up we will therefore in the motions the i hope that the parliament the the agree is the our own services ask to in the important the a budget the the the criteria the  and clarity meets a carefully report on the  posts in the parliament for to to
i hope that the work in the with a common  via a european interinstitutional really will quickly so we the problems the the in the next years for all institutions the the council the commission the parliament and the other institutions will arise together can tackle i i the on the need the staff in the next years
i hope really that we the that area large progress will make
i i now a minute to long about i i that with pleasure done
i i now more time been
the give i like the the group back because i only the half minute was prepared and i had proposed a minute to long to speak
the i i my personally  carried
i like again all members thank
we have what the other institutions the the a very collegiate way and on all party group s and other borders across a good result achieved
if the council the the next year can with and more to the parliament like listen would the still easier are
the the gentlemen mr programmes must not think that the arguments the the mr ferber i said have voted the is namely as that he fact five minutes time had while the  only half minute had indicated
the you us not forgive mr ferber
if you as moment still something would want say the because you has still a minute on the than will i you the floor give
mr the president gentlemen members mrs the commissioner ladies and gentlemen i i the pleased to you a day after the european council the nice during what in the european sector important progress are made the the president the the french republic you will from the before will do the second reading to present the the the november on by the council the budget the the european union
the is for i however not only a pleased and a honour but also a personal pleased that i here today again for you must before in the heart the the european democracy
the second reading the the council was preceded by a conciliation the november between the european parliament the council and the commission
during this long sitting could i i a duplication success be success a success for europe because we the milanese our initial differences to help and a political success because this not only a  is but especially also a budget which priorities to expression to
the representatives the the three institutions have not few effort flinch to to a comprehensive agreement to to on the budget i like the this opportunity than also both the  if mrs schreyer behalf the council you thank
the council has therefore a second reading taken and the account taken with the agreement that was achieved with the delegation the the parliament we have still a budget for view taken which not only financing possible must are the all priorities the the european union but also account must be taken with the real needs and with the actually ability to implementation the the appropriations
with this budget can we now the reform the the common agricultural changes and the in planned and affected structural measures into also can we the however all large programme programmes the implement to the joint by the european parliament and the council are the
i think the with particularly the the  programmes the transeuropean networks and the culture and audiovisual creation with the media plus which the november on agreement was achieved
the you i to now briefly in to to the the most points which during the second reading the the council progress is made the first point which agreement was achieved between the council and the parliament the the external actions that like say category the the budget
our institutions have here a common objective we want all in substantial financial resources the available to the the areas in the balkans
with the the november closed agreement was the for the balkans a total package agreed the million euro million of is for for serbia
this is a significant amount that up the the enormous needs the the in will arise the this necessary money to exactly to are million euro will with particularly found must be with the flexibility
the its the parliament for are second reading a important margin for the financing the all other geographical priorities and can also the ceiling the category be respected what also the wish the the council was
the second important point from the second reading the the council the the note the changes no the can we the new  the the commission budgetary up do find
we wanted further account the with the need the adaptation the the most recent data and therefore have we the amendments the the european parliament adopted with the to the expenditure for rural the the the progress reflected the is made the the approval and implementation the the national programme programmes
to finally has the council additional appropriations for a amount the million euro allocated for the financing the bse also that was agreed during the consultation the november on
with this million euro give we a first rapid budgetary response the the decision the the council to enlargement the the tests the bovine this must than also be as if a time amount
the bse requires namely more measures which the budgetary assessment still not whole is completed as precision rules are the must the any budgetary in eligible be taken and the necessary appropriations available be the
the must the prefer the opportunities to redeployment within category be investigated the additional necessary resources can then by means the a amended and supplementary budget available be made with respect course the the financial perspectives
the am i that our institutions the with other agree are become on the need all elements the the note the changes no in one reading the to take this note has namely not only the the the agricultural but also the the agreements and the into the the initial budget the a expect balance the the year
the third important point from the second reading the the council the the agreement on the programme for entrepreneurship that a continuation and a  is the the programme with the to the initiative for the period
the council and the parliament have agreement achieved on a considerably package for this period million euro
this result the expression the the priority the the european union has granted the the development the the central and small and the employment and is the merit the your rapporteur the here present mrs budget haug
this result  however also expression the the political priority the the council during the summits the luxembourg lisbon and feira has the
to finally is the november agreed the appropriations the the budget to increase this increase must however not more sums than the relation the the budget
you know that this a objective is that the council particularly after the the heart is and i must the than also emphasise that a rate the a considerable effort requires the the member this this over over the rate the their national budgets is
i aware hand however also that the parliament a considerable effort has done by this to accept for you means this agreement because that you few sometimes very difficult  must take the relation the your first reading
the agreement on the increase the the payments was possible thanks the proposal the the commission to for the years and next a  to make the billion euro the appropriations for community programme programmes
this proposal the the with the for the adoption the this programme programmes necessary deadlines and is by the council and the parliament accepted
therefore can in the necessary appropriations with million euro reduced be the relation the the draft the budget
ownership the this new element to we the that the council in second reading a budget has approved the with is has
the can the parliament for are second reading have on a considerable margin approximately billion euro for the financing the are  which course the general rate the must be respected
the council has the in are second reading course not limited to the four points the i just mentioned
we have also different amendments the the parliament with the to category internal policy adopted especially because we account wanted the with the developments in the legislation
we have also assent expressed with a number preparatory actions and pilot within the limit the the interinstitutional agreement and the after before consultation with the commission on the viability of
the list with points which the council and the parliament the with other agree are become would incomplete are without the reference the two important texts the this year were adopted
the first important text is a joint statement on the improvement the the information the the parliament and the council on the financial planning the the commission the initiative to this statement was by the mr colom i naval taken the i the the i greeting
the second important text is a joint statement with the to the report on the reform the the commission this could thanks the initiative the the mr elles recently the light saw
with this two statements the the transparency the the budgetary and the in the commission the started periodically reforms strengthened
i i can we with this statements ensure for more efficiency and that is if i the the i a common objective the both institutions
i importance here in any case large important the
more general like i emphasise that the on few days the end current budgetary clear has demonstrated how important the interinstitutional agreement the may is
thanks the consultation between the three institutions that in this agreement the regulated could we end agreement achieve on the budget
thanks the commitment the the flexibility that a the the most innovations is the the agreement the could we the with other agree be on the external actions the the european union in the is the account taken with the events the the during the procedure have occurred
with the additional appropriations can we in the programmes the the european union for the western balkans up
also has the council to this interinstitutional agreement to can respect considerable margins admissibility under the ceilings the the in the financial perspectives this applies with particularly for category internal policy and category external measures
with this margins can the parliament during are second reading own priorities the in the framework the the different community policies and actions
before we the budget final to adopt like i still point the the large important that the council importance the the respect the certain fundamental budgetary for the in the reserve into the appropriations the legal and the classification the the expenditure
the first must accordance the provisions the the financial rules the budgetary only appropriations in the reserve into if the relevant legal still not is adopted
therefore has the council in are second reading all appropriations again the the line the the the parliament to other reasons than the absence the a legal in the reserve had included
i am therefore welcome that our institutions the with other agree are become on the objectives make the the conditional  in the reserve what the parliament during are first reading had decided on the more the the  in category and the more the the appropriations for the reform the the commission in category in the framework the the note the changes no
the second must i insist the respect the the rules which the institutions considered be the to the the classification the the appropriations in compulsory and noncompulsory expenditure
your committee has namely in second reading with a amendment proposed two lines to change this concern one the system the early retirement and hand the expenditure for the agreements
the you i to the parliament that to attention that accordance the interinstitutional agreement this lines under the compulsory expenditure the that had the parliament also in are first reading recognised
therefore must we the on the article the the treaty that take that this budgetary after the second reading the the council final are the and not more for amendment in eligible to
after this overview like i still clear make that this budgetary the in a excellent atmosphere has place
the discussions did us sometimes little whiter but were always very targeted thanks the constant exchange have we allow positions better learn understand and could we end easier to a hope for everyone acceptable agreement to
a sound budget is a sound discussed budget
this budget would therefore under a excellent when born must be
i like my personal thank express the the to the the president the the committee the mr similarly wynn the three rapporteurs mrs budget haug and the gentlemen markus ferber and joan colom i naval and all members the the committee the i to my large pleased if meet during the six months the the presidency the the council
i can you assure that the council during very the budgetary has worked for a budget the the european union in the the to answer the the expectations the they both within if outside its borders has raised
i i have we apart the the priorities the any institution together a budget the established the which us all ambition to expression is we want because all a europe build that in service the the the citizens
this result must now by you be confirmed and i hope that this quickly will done
mr the president ladies and gentlemen in unlike to what during the negotiations in nice is happened were for the budget already after one few common night sitting important results achieved
otherwise than in nice are according i all three the institutions the european parliament council and commission the really satisfied with the result
i must say that the idea the the community during the whole year during all preparatory discussions our principle is been mrs parly behalf the commission thank i you and your staff this the much i
you you the debates and negotiations really the the most points focused i thank also mrs haug the rapporteur for its very interesting combination the large determination and large  the to this good result has led
i thank also the rapporteurs the gentlemen ferber and colom i naval the mr wynn president the the committee and all members the the commission for their large efforts the during the negotiations to good results have led
in the budget as they today before is for next year billion euro for new implementation and billion euro for payments available
the rising the budget as you you stressed with respectively and the relation the last year the increase is the approximately just large if the the the national budgets
very important is that the total  only the the common european gross national product is and therefore if  or  smaller is than this year
the that one that the budgetary in eight the taken but also that the in berlin agreed financial planning to less for the current member from to give and as the financing the the enlargement possible to make a success is
in that the must also be said that this figures as they now before not the supplementary budget include the there of the bse certainly must to
i will the this moment still on have
what is there now particularly the this budget
in the view the the commission is that the fact that the second pillar the the agricultural the promotion the the rural the highest rate some the growth is this
i think that this must to be out since there now in total billion euro available is the president the the commission agriculture said recently in a  that this still not second pillar but only a  is
that is not precisely billion is a seriously amount almost same if we in total for the foreign policy available have
what the foreign policy the can we say that the policy the the european union also thanks the budget excellent results will i am there also the convinced that the democratisation and the opportunity the a hope early stabilisation in the balkans the the common policy to thank are
i am that convinced that this success with the old concept the bilateral  which also the member against other be off not possible was been
the is the result the a common policy therefore is the also very good that the managed is in the budget again million euro for the balkans the to take
that was not simple but thanks the thoughtthrough use the the flexibility is the us managed comes what in nice if basis for the all was approved in total billion for the period to the are by the use the the flexibility even additional resources available
by million euro for emergency available to to has the union also proven that they quickly can act and its responsibility the the area the the foreign policy the the can take
very important is that not only country in the balkans if result the the democratisation the serbia less aid will to than before the developments in serbia in the prospect was the
a very important signal is also that we the new opportunities for cooperation the there now last has are also financial the full support
i like also the the opportunity use to the mr kouchner the in kosovo very many work has done to thank from the budget have we also this many support can to
also with the view the a good financial management is the reform the the commission the large important
a good financial management presupposes sufficient good staff
behalf the commission thank i the budgetary that they agree agrees that new posts be created
the parliament expect now that also the the areas which financial  programmes to now to late or bad were carried everything the done to for improvement to ensure ladies and gentlemen i can you assure the i say that in the particularly against the mr elles that the commission everything will do to the implementation the financial programme programmes better to let has than in the past the case was
the must however also clear are that the gagauz the the obligations from the past not only a good financial management but also sufficient money requires
almost a third the the budget is to the structural to support for region programmes with economic difficulties to their problems to overcome and their economic behind in to to the support the especially through the cohesion granted
in a special report has the court recently confirmed that this objective the achieved and that the resources the the cohesion good be used
the community its with common resources solidarity support for economic development the would course must are that the region programmes and countries the now the solidarity perceived in the future if we the european union enlargement prepared are the their turn solidarity with the new countries to are
ladies and gentlemen by the discovery the new  were also the the area the the budget namely the the area the health and consumer but also what the support for the affected farmers the immediately measures need the budget as we the today approve includes billion euro for subsidies the the beef
for the cofinancing the bse was already million in the budget included during their  have the ministers the agriculture if result the the bse new measures proposed
we are the there all on agree that the not sense has the approval the the budget from to to to the new measures the the to take we are the agreed agree that as quickly possible a supplementary budget the presented to the financing the the necessary measures to guarantee
the will to many money to i think than also that the council the ministers the economic affairs and finance the budgetary consequences the the measures must into
what here and this the asked or proposed vote because not with the available resources line
here applies moreover what also in nice again is stressed namely that the financial rules and borders the the budget in eight must be taken
by the change the the rate the the margin here also still what smaller i was the than also really annoying that the ministers the agriculture the the the make the the informed were earlier still the few  with fruit vegetables bananas and nuts are  the in total million more subsidies require
if new urgent needs the the with the view the the bse must in the budget the new priorities be the than has that also consequences we must here than also clear decisions take
if commissioner for budget i i fully behind the completely necessary measures also the support the the beef from the fact that we one the beef with billion euro and hand the destruction the beef with hundreds millions euro must subsidising that according i however that we in the whole agricultural urgent something must take
the european parliament will the the doubt agree are
many the the in nice taken decisions are for the budget and the budgetary very important
the that area the the for not few the the institutions easier
more to more must we us verheugen on the good atmosphere which the negotiations on the budget are has and on the good results the we have achieved behalf the commission thank i again all the this have contributed
mr the president if rapporteur like i both the presidentinoffice president the the council if mrs the commissioner thank for their kind statements but in my previous speech i i a clear down question the
where the to is is that someone us the rational to not to say  way nobody what the difference is between a annual revision the the financial perspectives and the use the the flexibility
i would like a statement hear
remains the from than will i the silence if answer must as
mr the president i like like a answer give the the question the the mr colom i naval on the use the the flexibility and the relationship to the revision the the financial perspectives
the flexibility is now two year behind other used and the the i i the wrongly as if a type revision the the financial perspectives
i believe that this not there the can are or procedure or content
the procedure for the flexibility is down in the interinstitutional agreement and the intention of is in exceptional cases the possibility to offer to financing the expenditure over the in berlin the ceilings and the without the the financial perspectives to do
i i are the two approaches therefore content not with other in contradiction but complement they other rather the
what now the special cases the application the which we in the last two year faced are been to know kosovo and serbia must i you say that the use the the flexibility the possibility has is to special expenditure this had special efforts be taken
in both cases has the flexibility us the possibility is the the need forward to are
in the case the kosovo had we the staggered the the aid up and in the case the serbia had we a large amount the before there a final assessment the the needs could be made and before a decision could be taken on the roles between the different donors
the commitment the the flexibility means therefore according the council not that the viability the the in berlin the financial perspectives in risk the the
the council has fact for the framework the support the the reconstruction the the western balkans a  the this is although a indicative amount but the does with this financial perspectives
i hope the a answer to have given the the question the the mr colom i naval
the after this explanatory which all members doubt their benefit can do to we now on to the know the the positions the the different parliamentary committees
the and mr the president first like i like mrs haug thank for the hard work and its success with the to the central and small
that was high the the priorities the the commission industry and we are very pleased on the by its achieved success
but this is not only a success for the commission industry and for the parliament the is also a reflects the the priorities the the authorities in europe
and that is now just the point that the i for only consternation has taken when i looked what position in this whole process by the council was welcome
my commission is particularly interested in the 
we had many praise for commissioner busquin the our expectations the that area has transcended
we have the council many times hear explain ensure to want ensure that europe a leading role plays the research
then see we that the council considerably  the the appropriations so mrs haug must the the a and another the to to
we have today the the council to hear been that the prepared is to there comes to do
that is the context which we here work
i like our rapporteur congratulate but our commission is however somewhat disappointed on the approach the the council
president i like the rapporteur mrs haug thank for the excellent cooperation and also the president the the committee the mr wynn
i i the regard the what now before direction council and commission a two comments
to to start the total budget
course is the as that the almost is the the european budget but if you add what the member in europe spend and what the european union spends the the budget than come you the and of is still a important part to rural and 
compared the other  in the world is that a coordinate
if american companies worst three so support received and a arbitrary country if turkey more than the the  spends the country and horticulture than is europe for a descend the the first grade
the second point the bse
i i that that we in the night the and november when we the mrs parly the table been fought have if  to more money for the bse to to
the committee said use the area the there is between the financial perspective and the final budget the before that was the that at still over million use million for the bse
with draw depend specificallytargeted were we a few million euro involved
two  in germany and we are a week further
that means that there in fact already a supplementary budget must to the million euro
that the the that the committee in this house very state has recognised what there the the item is and in the sense also increase criticism had the council and commission with the to the heading the 
more decisions at the testing in place the draconian measures later had significantly less cost and the would to ride for words are the regard the this political policy also from the council and commission to to say then to we the account the in the budget
that can not because for the rest the the budget have we a agreement with council and commission for all posts the before and that means supplementary budgets that that additional money the the member must are and not the empty the the existing budget because on take i the you you your floor given i say the both in the direction council if commission with the to what we with other have agreed
mr the president also i like mrs haug thank for the excellent work the the prepare the the budget
mrs haug and the committee have account taken with the proposals the the commission regional policy transport and tourism
the objective the our commission was that the budget for next year sufficient appropriations had contain
as the guaranteed that the payment the the previous period less the and that the new programmes the effective way the the be the
as need must the the appropriations in with a supplementary budget can change
the amendments for the crossborder cooperation are based while we what the interreg and urban the objective just not saddens
what the transport the is the emphasis the the development the the transeuropean networks
i am welcome with the commitment for sustainable transport but must however see that the sums for transport and tourism especially symbolic are
in the next years is this considerably more money for need
our commission will the implementation the the budget in the monitoring the
with a effective use the the resources can the especially in the smes and the new technology for more employment ensure
president if rapporteur for opinion the the commission development like i the first the that the european parliament a large victory has made because the cut the latin asian and african  objectives are made
i thank this very in the particularly the commission and the council
america asia africa both the balkans if equal  for us external policy and not against other off
that must will as also that from the discussion in the multiannual be regulated
the second like i with large satisfaction the that the whole parliament political broad from all groups support its the the specific  as this now in the budget by the commission development are proposed also the basis the the historic data the the european commission with particularly the doubling the the budgets for education and care in the  america asia africa and the european development together such billion euro  is a enormous progress
output in place the input
we count the strong instructions and spending by the european commission with this objectives
i thank mrs haug the i
mr the president also i would the rapporteur mrs haug want thank for the excellent work that they if rapporteur the committee for the budget has done and for its efforts to in to to the the ask the we from different committees to the have the
what the the commission rights the the women is the result now not exactly what we for view had
the budgeted sums are many lower than the what we had proposed but we observe us the that this on the whole acrosstheboard is happened and therefore to we agreement with the final result
that means not that we us in the next year not again will working for what what in our view the most fair and the most adequate is and what us in the opportunity will to to the objectives to achieve the the commission rights the the women and equal opportunities
the and mr the president late i first to that i the broad budget support
this is within the financial perspectives has
there is for us not important obligation than not more from to give than we have
i like like something say on what probably the smallest line is million euro for the ombudsman
that is a very low amount
the is the the less than a penny per capita the the european union
let we the the penny the the citizens mention
we must there absolutely for ensure that we to the citizens listen and that if he somewhere a complaint on has we on procedures have to the matter right to to
that is a good upbringing expenditure
the commission petitions hopes the much i that its budget enough will are to a so database to create so citizens the the treatment the their petition want follow the possibility have to after to to or there already progress are made
we hope the to succeed
finally is information a important point for this parliament
we must ensure the enforcement the our among programmes
in that the would i with particularly  want mention with through which people the through the media the the informed can to the the serve and allow the parliament and union
mr the president i would i want already behind the express the the to the mrs haug in the with its excellent work
i am the completely agree with the position the our mr joan colom the regard the the revision the the financial perspectives
the amount the the common fisheries is hardly the the community budget
that low amount that essential is for the conservation the the activities the this sector and for the conservation the the economic activity the the areas the the the fisheries on are that however precisely because are modest extent time again a attractive  for those the the find are to money to new policies to finance
mrs the commissioner fish is a vital part the a healthy balanced and  food
for the european consumer the the the the market operating what he with a reassure heart can buy is fish a safe product
he will than also the opinion are that the the the budget the the european union particularly good spent is
mr the president the indignation the the members the the economic and monetary commission on the budget was free large reason for the indignation was especially that the campaign prince for in the reserve was placed
if result the that decision would the campaign on the introduction the the euro not in the important year have can place while the  the the dollar uncertainty caused and the need the information on the introduction the euro and introduced in very large is
in the over days has the committee decided the parliament for to to the from the reserve to take and the this line to to
we thank the members the the committee this the i
the economic and monetary commission can satisfied are and the commission can now plans make
mr the president around the treatment the the budget is this year not large tragedy increased
that means however not that everything easy is been
the business approach the rapporteur haug has the are force proven
also president wynn deserves a compliment
what the culture the is the good that the financing the the multiannual programmes as socrates culture youth and the new programme media plus the the level the the budget in item is
hope are the problems the the the the implementation have occurred over
the is the important that the union its citizens good the service can are
the budget includes direct financing the the european cultural networks
the have they doubt need but the rules the the financing are still not in item
also is there there the to many arbitrary
the commission culture youth education media and sport is than also the plan this beginning next year attention the to to
the involved low sums must the a good and fair way be used
the and mr the president i am here behalf the european party and the european democrats
i like the way the release the the position the my group like say that we the work the mrs haug and also the our own rapporteur the mr ferber very the price have the and that we the commissioner mrs schreyer and the presidentinoffice mrs parly want thank for their valuable contribution the the the to the november the a budget the as the presidency rightly said if a milestone can be as because the way which parliament council and commission joint a decision knew to take on a budget for the european union
we have now a budget the under the is we have a budget mr colom the within the financial perspectives is has
i suspect that to the just simple to say there flexibility is for the small sums and that revision need is for the large sums but we will in the next years the see how that you
in any case like i like both the commission if the presidentinoffice presidency the the council thank for their comments on the common statement the we have up because that also already a first indication is the the way which we monitoring will to the the improvements the the implementation and the the performance the the programme programmes with particularly in category
and to this just what further the in to to we have very what work for the go and we look  from to the report the mrs schreyer that there hope for june is so we the the content of use can make the the conference the the budget for
but if i think the the issue the the behind the the commitments and the way which we the period the new obligations would can to the than is this clear under the scope the the financial rules and this will we on must to negotiate
we believe that the absolutely the fundamental important is that this report the address the restoration the the confidence the our citizens in the way which the institutions the the european union function
than still just a comment on the reserve mrs the presidentinoffice president the the council
if i you good understand i said you that we not use the the reserve should make because that against the rules would are
we use the reserve with particularly in first reading to the attention to draw the weak points in the function the a the policy
the information within the institutions is the this at a scandal therefore in place the money to put in the line for information while we know that the not efficient used the will we a large part the that money in the reserve tomorrow in pending the the right proposals the the commission
course would the solution are to us if  the possibility to give to in the during the the year the amount that spent must be the to draw and that would the agree the amiss the  can are something to the the revision the the financial rules to to add
finally would i  still want say that in nice perhaps the impression is the that we a little in the direction the intergovernmentalism seem to to with a council the a decision the on numbers in us parliament without us this the advance on consulted to have
us confidence if a the the three institutions the and the also the institutional agreement and the financial perspectives the will only means continue if we the succeed to that confidence mutual to let are and if we in any stage on our fundamental interests be consulted
the the mr the president first like i mrs parly thank they must us now leave but i think that they this the the leave still can hear
given the the experience the the over year has they also the the on the the council for a very good atmosphere taken during its whole presidency has they because large efforts made
i thank also mrs schreyer for its very constructive approach and course also mrs haug for its excellent work also thank i also the mr colom i naval and the mr ferber
we must now decide or we next thursday already than not with this budget can agree we must this course good on give
if social in the parliament will we that do because we believe that during the negotiations many good was achieved and that important priorities not only were retain but still were strengthened
in whole europe is the unemployment still still more than the european union must with the available budget than also a clear signal give
we must us make to this disease for our economy and our people to combat therefore is the good that this million euro next year available are with a  the million for this year
the people can than see that we their problems seriously seriously take and remind work
the is very good that with category the this budget the them the in the the need life or in whose countries all in the world initiative the the the are can be shown that the european parliament and the european union them not forget also not if we itself problems have the must be resolved also here ensure we ensure that there enough money available is
for the people in the balkans is the after the long and violent conflicts which we very decisive are in important to perceived that they also for the reconstruction the us can count
in the european parliament are people the there concern for to that the money also really available the the where and when the need is and that we us not to do words to but very specific action to
i think therefore that we good work have done already can i of parameters not everything mention
we have however also few decisions taken which a task decided is
as like i example against the commission say that we with additional posts have agreed because we want that different programme programmes better be carried we want that the commission better can work than in the past possible was
the must however clear are that this also a responsibility and a obligation for the commission means we will its because the this process hand
we will monitoring the with the commission in contact continue and still again questions how the is and or there really improvement is before we still further steps with its want take
this is also a obligation the the council
i like also the council few questions to without that i the compromise now in doubt like draw
is the as that we year the year must look what in the previous year still the money on was to that then on to to so we in region programmes if serbia and the balkans in total still enough money available have
is the really as that we first agree must look what we still on have
is us signal the this people first give we you what remains and than look we what we still can 
that can however not our message are
by your refusal to with us on the  the this challenge to speak you you the sense and the spirit the the interinstitutional agreement the the again the
you says constantly that the financial perspectives for you inviolable are
also the interinstitutional agreements between the three institutions are however important they must ensure ensure that we the the area the the planning security have
the balkans and other region programmes have security the the area the the planning need
the repeated use the the flexibility is contrary with the interinstitutional agreement the european parliament has because for that instrument struggle to on a reserve for unforeseen expenditure to million to can have
the was never the intention that we the year the year would use to  to put the areas the we how than also must finance
you undermining the interinstitutional agreement we will carefully into or we this still want part
mr the president first like i the rapporteurs for the budget mrs haug and the mr ferber thank for their excellent work
also like i the president the the committee the mr wynn thank for the excellent conciliation and the the constructive way lead the the commission
the budget for next year is based the a strict budgetary
although the agricultural the almost the half the the total budget of with more than increase even if we with the note the changes account the growing the budget in total with only
that means that the the the other categories very reluctant is with the use the the resources
that is only the the gnp what very low is since the ceiling according the financial perspectives is
in money expressed means this stinginess more than billion euro
this is however a risk the linked
there is a structural imbalance in the budget because the sums for the commitments billion euro higher are than the sums for the appropriations
that means that the payment will increase
therefore is the concern the the parliament that the payment the redressing rightly and therefore was the common statement the the parliament and the council really need
further can the with satisfaction the that the council and the parliament a agreement have achieved on the european budget for next year
that shows the that both executive bodies the correct way their responsibility to for the financial management the the european union
the is other to regret that the parliament again agree a fight had make for financial resources for the western balkans
for the other can i say that the what my group the good is that the for the initiative a multiannual programme with a budget the million euro is agreed the is also good that the agreement could achieve on the budget the the in the common initiative unused resources
in a large part the the  posts the the parliament was this whole year not for
that shows the that the policy the next time flexible must be
with the mentioned comments is my group prepared the  to accept
the the mr the president also i thank the rapporteur and course also the commissioner and the president the the council for the good work that they have done
also our group will the budget approve from this budget that because that we despite the growing pressure again a exemplary compromise have closed
the growing pressure has especially with the unemployment the bse and the pact for the balkans to make
for already this urgent problems have we solutions found and a good compromise developed the important the the european union was the still the the come
we wanted the act and credibility the the european union safe to
however voice i expressly in with what the mr colom i naval just has said the financial perspectives be still more a straitjacket that real planning or  impossible makes
the transparency the the budget has to suffering under the continuing use the the flexibility the term will also that our credibility weaken
also the carryover the transfer the financial resources to crisis programmes as the financing the the pact for the balkans guarantees not that the budgetary really transparent is
now already the the large risk clear that in the next years the conflict between meda the projects for countries the the mediterranean sea and the balkans need will be although we all know that exactly this urgent money need is
hand see we that the council if the to bse or national interests is the financial perspectives suddenly the the the again can to
the statements the the mr chirac the the european council the nice were very interesting
the council must urgent look how he with the financial perspectives like deal
the parliament will next year certainly a many country party are
the best mr programmes we interrupt the debate the this point to to listen to the president the the french republic and the president the the council
the debate will to course time accordance the agenda be resumed
european council french presidency
mrs the president gentlemen european members the does i particularly many pleased that i today in your central can are to with you the balance the to make the the french presidency the the union and to you a overview to give the the progress the the last months are made
the july on i i you in this chamber our ambitions presented therefore you was the the informed the our plans
i think that we our commitments have can up you must this itself assess
i am i that aware that we this result whose the the contribution the this european parliament to thank have
as you know am i just back from nice where i together with the first minister and the members the the government close negotiations i held
i like with you that like say the representatives the the european peoples first the results the the igc on the reform the the institutions discuss
there was particularly many the the stake we are than also pleased that we a agreement have can achieve that three year ago still unthinkable was
we have because the obstacles from the way can overcome and are now in the to the obligations the we in helsinki are made the relation the the countries after to to this is now possible without that our union of damage not to affected
the europe the the future will the effective way can continue function i think to should say that we in this respect our obligations are fulfilled
i am i there aware the aware that the treaty the nice not the all expectations the the european parliament up i think however that we with this treaty the maximum possible result have achieved
there were because binding restrictions with this treaty have we done what the us expect was
after the enlargement the its unprecedented not will know will the union because in the continue to decisions to take and to act as you know were the negotiations  but the winners and losers can not about be
three year ago in amsterdam was that the still not possible was to a precisely balance to achieve between one representation and hand efficiency
this is in nice the managed thanks the efforts the any the the member the has made
the is where that some more willingness have shown than other i like the cooperative member like thank for their contribution
also should we welcome are with the european when the there in nice  which we a solution could find for the leftovers the amsterdam and the future the europe could up
as we had promised are there now not leftovers the nice
we wanted that the commission a strong institution in the heart the the union would continue that like say a institution the in the would are to ambitious proposals to do there is decided to the second commissioner the to abolish and the maximum number commissioners the to to which the member the basis the full equality and the intrusion a commissioner should make
the is here moreover to a yes ceiling with the treaty the nice the there therefore for taken that the commission the important the the union can continue represent and efficient can continue action
also the the president the the commission additional powers since he future the qualified majority the vote will be appointed this is a real progress and makes the the commission a more body
i know that the parliament the the negotiations many important it the the issue the the number areas which the qualified majority the vote decided must to be
this point was also a the the difficult issues
there are however real progress the this point made also already had the presidency like further want to i like the say that the french delegation the particularly open has up
i like you ask to the results the nice not to underestimate
there will future on thirty additional issues the qualified majority be decided and there is progress made the issues if justice and home affairs foreign trade and social cohesion let we not forget that a number member the this areas the the beginning the the negotiations serious reservations had expressed
the presidency regrets the however that there the not consensus has adversely with the to the tax issue and the social affairs
there is a balanced agreement achieved what the the number vote the the member within the council
by the enlargement was a reweighting necessary but with the agreement is also meet has the the member with the smallest germans this member want because involved continue the the decisionmaking within the union and that is necessary
i like this add that the democratic legitimacy the the decisions within the council guaranteed is and that the council in the future good will can function
the new mechanisms on the demographic net and the necessary majority the member the the vote will the union not prevent to decisions to can take
i am now fore the one the the most positive results the the igc
the closer cooperation is enormous simplified what the the first and the third pillar
this form the cooperation will always and for everyone open
course will in this framework the acquis community and the institutional framework guaranteed continue
the closer cooperation will however be simplified and there will actually use the be made
we have as the guarantee that europe under all circumstances quickly progress can make
the opening the the closer cooperation for the second pillar must also if a progress be given
i like you there further the point that the the igc decided is to the powers the the european parliament to extend
in the new provision in article on the  in case the violation the the fundamental the your institution a very important role allocated
there is for in a new legal what the the statute the the european political parties and the parliament the accordance article the the treaty the status the institutional mover
this are remarkable progress although i understand that the enlargement the the codecision in your view not far enough is the presidency shares in this respect your opinion
now the igc behind the back is must there a indepth debate to be held on few issues the the essential important are for the future the the european union
the european europe creating steadily and this means that we the union from democratic view  and the institutions profile and transparent must make the must clear are the what way the powers between the union and the member divided are
only than can europe because the the wish the are peoples meet to
to this objectives to achieve will there a debate on the future the europe be held the european council has decided that this debate there must to
course will the european parliament here closely the be involved
in must this debate to are completed
we hope that we with this debate meet to the the ensure the in the last time very clear are expressed
the debate is however not condition for the enlargement and the accession the the countries will there therefore not by be delayed
this are in the briefly the results the the institutional area in nice are made and the basis which europe again further can
the does i pleased that the countries the the last days as positive on this results have shown
this is the proof that we the their expectations meet are has
the enlargement is because a hot  in europe
they is a large challenge and same a historic at in the reunification the us continent
the french presidency has everything in the work the to the negotiations to do succeed
thirty new issues are resolved with including the a number very complex issues the the the with the acquis community a number countries that still but recently the the table has great has now already let see that they the older countries perhaps even can up
in nice have we thanks the excellent work the the commission the way can up for the next months
this shows but again that the union the the future is at
with this allergic way have we a strong signal issued that during the meeting the the european conference the thursday on good is take
in the last six months are the growth and employment in europe has
further has there a deepening the the emu place we have because the economic policy within the euro between better between and we have there together shipping behind the to our citizens familiar to make with the euro
the last weeks are there three important progress made the i here like like mention
first are the already long time undermining negotiations on the package completed and is there decided for a tax the the income from savings further is the social agenda adopted after a long period the consultation with in the particularly the social partners
the union has this now on a programme which for the next five year objectives and agreements are down the the have the the law the social protection the  the permanent education and the fight against discrimination and exclusion
to finally are in nice after difficult negotiations the in total thirty year have took agreements the social area made what the the european company
the french presidency is pleased that this negotiations now last are completed
the european union is further started with the implementation the the decisions the in feira are taken on the new economy and the growth
we are agreed to the costs the access to internet substantial to reduce
the union has further decided to the  the the access to the local 
the desired european patent there now to are now the necessary provisions in the treaty included
gentlemen members france wanted during are presidency the the ensure the the european citizens meet to
in nice have we the charter the the fundamental the the union officially presented this text is from political respect very valuable
we will in the future see what the scope that is i like your parliament thank for are considerable contribution the the the the the charter
thanks this text be the dignity freedom and solidarity the the the union the basis are better guaranteed
we will so possible to this charter refer and quickly give on the status the the must to to
i know that your parliament here particularly many gentlemen the importance
under this presidency has the union the europe the the culture and the students the new impetus for two months ago have our ministers the education a action for mobility adopted that from measures there
we are agreed to for the programme media plus a substantial amount the million euro available to to this programme is because the particularly large important for the european audiovisual sector and the industry in the particularly
you can the perhaps remind that i here i about on the french wish to within the union more attention to to the the specific nature the the sport and the social function that
in the in nice adopted statement is with this wish account taken also the now considered to the fight the doping the european level to coordinate
if we the european citizens want involve the the european europe must we the human aspect not from the view to lose
we must ensure ensure that the economy environment the balance between our regions and the high managed retain continue everyone importance here because rightly very many gentlemen the
i think the in the particularly the the services the general economic important the presidency is pleased that in nice the within the commission and the council the the take debate is concluded with the adoption the a statement which the very important role the this services the the maintain the the social and territorial cohesion the europe is stressed
the last six months has the presidency there everything the done to the the union a safer environment to make accordance the wish the our citizens
the presidency like that europe more protection offers in the sense sense the the floor
in nice have we therefore the way budget for the up the a independent european authority for food
everyone asking the now course the what consequences the epidemic the the mad will have we must first the confidence the the citizens restore
that the in that we immediately the by france desired measures must take the during the last agriculture are adopted i think the the the ban the meal and the testing the all bovine the bse
we must however also to think the the farmers and the everyone the working is in the fodder the  they be because serious affected by this crisis
everyone think the a safer environment also the the safety the sea
a year ago was the erika for the french coast the under despite the enormous efforts the the many volunteers and the authorities are the harmful consequences the this shipwreck still always see the the coast
few weeks ago has the   with a freight chemical substances level the the  shipwreck ago
such disasters the the result are the human negligence should the in the future not more arise
the last months have we many progress made the the examination the the excellent proposals the the commission
your parliament has the the november clear expressed for a first package measures this measures will next week again the the ministers the transport be presented
the swedish presidency that the environment if a the are priorities as must now ensure that the second package proposals the adopted i think the in the particularly the the up the a european bureau for the safety the sea
given the urgent nature the this issue has the council in nice the large exception a appeal done the the member to in first body up the measures the this package which political agreement there the implement to to
as everyone know is the greenhouse a large threat
in den hague has the european union the used for a credible and effective agreement which the this urgent and important issue the head can be is
the union has the obligations the kyoto the coherent way defended
they will the no continue working to its partners that to convince that they the the their turn must continue make
we must next year a agreement see to achieve that provides in the necessary reduction the the emissions the gases the the greenhouse cause
also are there in between consultation measures affected against the countries and regions the according the  not to cooperation prepared are further has europol more powers been to the fight against black money to up
to finally is there for in the up the a european  this are the most measures the a coherent and fully action
in this framework is moreover also the temporary unity for legal cooperation eurojust up this institution will possible next year be replace by a body for criminal cooperation
further like the french presidency that europe international are voice more is make this objective must the the long term to be implemented
the presidency like the union the resources in hands give which they the the stage a role the importance can play its voice can let hear and action can take the cfsp must the in this direction develop
the the short term like the presidency that the fifteen member more demonstrated give the political like to their own interests to defend when there european affairs the the stake are i think the in the particularly the the southeast the europe
what this ambitions the have we certainly progress made
first are we in nice the by the european council in cologne and helsinki made agreements fulfilled
the objectives the we us had the are achieved
a year ago have we the on what military resources the union in must have to the in the treaty order crises to can prevent and in to flood
the member have now commitments done on the forces and military resources the they in case the crisis will make
outside the beleaguered will the european union also the available to on the necessary directed and  and on information to complex operations to country the sea and in the air to can out
the union like that this army in full harmony with the structures the the nato can function and as need the aid the the nato can invoked
if europe the strengthened will that course also the atlantic alliance the good to
the european union has further in nice for in the up the permanent bodies the need are to a common foreign and security to can formulate and from to to a committee for political and security a military committee and a european staff
there is decided to in the treaty to for in the up the a committee for political and security that a central role must to
in times the crisis will there powers the this committee be delegated
with the revision the the treaty the this point be the important and the irrevocable nature the the in nice taken decisions stressed
still before this institutions actually be up want we that the union more control the the important international issues when its interests the the stake are
what europe the must clear to be the what the europeans want and expect
i believe that this message the the summit the zagreb which for the first time the western balkans and the fifteen member meet were good is matter
there is during this summit out the the possibility the accession to the union and everyone has recognised that this the way is to peace to achieve the compliance the the human to guarantee and regional cooperation the to to
the the summit the zagreb are certainly not all problems resolved but thanks the process the stabilisation and association can the the to follow way be the further are the the summit progress with the process made and is there a prospects down that based is the the values the the european union
during the euromediterranean conference the marseilles is despite the unfortunate crisis in the east has that all participants want to the the process the barcelona and this process also want succeeds
the does us pleased that the union during this conference has committed the next seven year billion euro for this process from to draw course are the loans the the eib the this amount including
mrs the president gentlemen european members i think to should see that our union the last six months is strengthened and the has prepared the the accession the the new members now we in the are to together the function the the union to guarantee can we the european family spouses
this progress are the all institutions to thank
i am welcome with the way which the member within the council have worked
i like further a floor the thank up to the commission and its president the mr romano prodi he has the because decisive shown to the initiatives and the plans the the the programme the the presidency were to achieve
i like here also behalf the first minister and the french government in the first place your parliament thank for are contribution
the is because the large important that the european parliament that the mind and ambitions the the citizens voices fully the involved the the decisions on our future
france has special attention the the role the this parliament spent
you you often the mr moscovici and the other ministers in your central had the presidency the the council has because time your plenary meetings and committees than
gentlemen european members the presidency like you you thank for this cooperation for your support and for your hospitality
i like president jacques chirac you thank i give now immediately the floor the the mr prodi the us behalf the commission to will speak
mr the president i your the
mrs the president the the parliament mr the president the the council ladies and gentlemen members the european council the december will in the remind continue if a particularly long and complex
that was in the expected with a such agenda and as was the also
there are in nice good decisions taken the some of been we already long to wait
the charter the the fundamental is solemn become
i doubt personally not the the fundamental nature the this text the those the him to weak find and i know that many the you that also find would i want say that he very carefully is up and developed precisely with the intention a legal standard to create
the parliament and the commission have already let know that they the plan are this charter in are whole to to apply
gentlemen members thirty year ago was a beginning made with the construction the a european society
this is a legal instrument the obvious usefulness where urgent to asked was and that missed was the the large restructuring the the recently have occurred
fortunately are there now not obstacles more for a rapid introduction the the charter
what the enlargement the the strategy the the commission proposed is approved
also is the social agenda adopted the result the a productive cooperation with the presidency as here is said
the proposals the the commission on safety the sea and for the up the a bureau for food are with assent welcome as the decisions the favour the our seven outermost region programmes
this are few the the issues the the the state and government are presented
i mention still a another a renewal the not the important regurgitating is
in nice is namely also talk on the organisation the the meetings itself how been and complicated the work is and on the still europe locations
the european council has the sensible decision taken from now still more in brussels meet to to
the position the brussels if capital the europe the therefore strengthened
applause
after the already planned meetings will the half the the meetings in brussels be taken
if the european union once eighteen member counts will all meetings this be taken
i believe sincerely that this initiative the president chirac our assent deserves
applause
we to now the the intergovernmental conference and the the treaty the nice the you i to first to stress how grateful i michel barnier am for are work
applause
he has the worked with the parliament just if i and even more than i in the particularly with from napolitano and are commission with the two rapporteurs leinen and dimitrakopoulos and course with the members brok and tsatsos the the fully have used
to finally mrs the president your speeches to the council were a fine the clarify
mrs the president you remember the course that i during my last speech to this sitting level for the summit i said that we a treaty need had with a effective added
i promised when with particularly still agree back to to to the results law to evaluate
in your speech the the opening the the summit has you also said that the parliament not only the quantity but also the quality the the results the nice would assess
we can the progress the nice only on only time exactly and carefully assess but in this stage can we already few points evaluate
the first point is the enlargement the the decisionmaking the qualified majority
in figures is the to a important progress a thirty new leaves will under this type decisionmaking the
that the therefore still more the general standard in the council something what we not must underestimate
but what the quality the the the a another story in the sensitive sectors the the cohesion the tax policy and the social legislation is there hardly or not progress made
applause
the this areas is the conference deadlock the the intransigence attitude the few member
on am i serious disappointed and not only to the consequences the short term this member have refused that to work and demonstrated given the lack
who europe only but see if a 
applause
to the to benefit when there need the is and there distance the to take when that not as is or the already enough has has makes not only a historic mistake but practised also a crime the the new generations they should more the europe expect
despite this closed attitude the mutual concessions the are still is there the the area the justice and home affairs however only progress made the is in essence to decisions the to the summit the are crop
however must we they not underestimate
the is the clear that the up the the new policy for justice and crossborder crime that in tampere was approved again the question under is the the timetable the tampere will not be achieved
i hope that or the parliament or the commission the debt will to the this delay
to finally like i my recognition express the president chirac and the prime jospin the us in the have the the most contradictions the our policy way to work
there is a good balance found between the justified reservations with particularly on the cultural diversity and a effective strong negotiating the our partners
gentlemen members i believe that we now have on a essential instrument for the comprehensive union the commission will this use the make but will the still its role the supervisory body continue play
the the one on will they the closer cooperation use to new objectives to achieve for the countries the like more want work the the other on will they everyone protect against the risk the way if result the a without increase the closer cooperation
on the institutions itself like i three things say
the provisions on the commission are carefully and radical changed
the commission can maximum  members to then will the necessary and by many desired reforms in force act
same are there however important reforms the its  in the the
the president will the majority the vote be elected and not more unanimously
also has the president after the commission is elected the competence a commissioner to people and can he or they with a large extent the independence decide on the organisation the the commission itself as the allocation the portfolio and the appointment the the vicepresident
the most result for the parliament is the statute the the european political parties
the commission has our joint concerns on the protection the the financial interests the the union explained and us proposal for the appointment the a european public prosecutor defended unfortunately without success but there is still not final decision taken
the is however extremely worrying that the number members the the parliament in fact used is to the  in the council to compensate
the this and the the coherent problems must we in the future many more attention to we must us not more secularise up but many more itself proposals the table to
the difficult were finally the discussion and the decision on the votes the the vote in the council
that was inevitably given the model the the conference but the result is more to mr the the one on because the now still difficult is a qualified majority to find and therefore easier to a decision to block while in a greater union precisely the opposite need was
applause
the the other on because the decisionmaking still complicated is become that is therefore favour in against the wish the the citizens namely greater and transparency
applause
therefore had we to the double majority asked the only objective comprehensible means that the a broad support the small and large countries could count
applause
especially the belgian first minister   deserves praise he has the to the effort effort for a fairer representation the the countries and for a reasonable threshold for the qualified majority also already was the still still to high
the the way has he the important historic role the belgium in the european union still agree stressed
applause
mrs the president gentlemen members we must recognise that the difficult conclude the the summit the nice the the already a success was
that had succeed and thanks the commitment the the presidency is the us also managed
there are not leftovers not leftovers the the table the nice regions
the is now matter realistic to are and to ensure that the treaty as quickly possible the confirmed
then can we the new member into in agreement with the conclusions the helsinki
we must decisive in the direction continue
gentlemen members the summit the nice has the impression us as president chirac also said that many their shortterm have let considerations over the vision
however vote the statement on the future the the union the this summit i optimistic
the commission is the that aware how important the is the powers between the european union and the member more the to through
the charter the the fundamental in the treaty into the treaties simplify and the role the our institutions the discussion to that is a enormous task the still for us is and carefully must be tackled
the governments the parliaments and the citizens the the current member and the the countries must this work and let see that europe dynamic is and constantly in construction
the is also a necessary task because the experience in nice let see that this way to the treaties to review not more adequate is
applause
the procedure for the changes the the institutions the under pressure and must itself amended be as the structure the the community
the commission will proposals submit to the way the this process to improve i am the your cooperation and the your support
mrs the president mr the president the the council gentlemen members ladies and gentlemen after this first incomplete analysis the i enthusiastic and impartial i try to to must we not from the view lose that the final objective the the summit the nice the europe the europe was and still still is
the new millennium has us a opportunity without unprecedented is to the countries the us continent to spouses in a large area where peace stability and growth there
nice is a step the way to that ideal a smaller step than we had want and can to but in each case one in the good direction
therefore question i your support
loud and longterm applause
the es mrs the president mr the presidentinoffice president the the european council mr the president the the commission gentlemen mr programmes end is there the the summit however a result from the bus has
time are we from the problems
now is the matter that we the text in the parliament precise study
mr the presidentinoffice president the the european council far can i you say what there the the the site the the council least what this to at morning was when the treaty once is approved will the available be the
i request you the officials the the council to questions to least the text the to apply
to my idea is there in nice however the something decided
in each case is the the the already a interfered that there a agreement is achieved
the was namely not to leftovers the what in amsterdam the the item is the and which not agreement is achieved but to issues the the essential important are for the administration the europe
the can we now therefore the the work
we will you the your floor the what the the content the the agreement but to the the late regard is there not many reason to satisfaction
there they the out that the intergovernmental conference in principle to objective had the function the the union to improve with the view the the achieve the the enlargement
i fear however that we to make have with a compromise between national interests that there in the wield the the night soon is  a compromise that the future community decisionmaking still further will make
the is not only as that there the a number crucial areas the held the the unanimity but we have now three types qualified majority
for the calculate the the qualified majority the the originally however yardstick the the the population in some versions the and in again other versions the built
that percentage is as high that the amounts the the restoring the the veto with particularly the the the countries
there is there the a step the all areas the the community life and i predict you mr the presidentinoffice president the the council that our citizens the and to i fear also the parliamentarians and the government the back will must times to school to  to to
applause
the role the in the decisionmaking the the union is play for the commission and the parliament will with the the concern must be examined
if we want that the union if community the values the interests reflect the all member and peoples the they includes than are the commission and the parliament in the community view the appropriate bodies to this in to are by their action in the framework the the charter the the fundamental
if this institutions be weakened and the charter outside the treaty the taken how can we europe than closer the the citizens to
same the in the the the the positive the statement on the enlargement the that the countries against end to the union should join the government the the countries the this in negotiations are have the results the nice welcomed
well there is however a point that we not on the head should see if a child are mindset article for are anniversary must the the to know or there sufficient place is in house and or there enough money is for the 
the is matter that we our agreements seriously take
how are we in this situation up has
the is already to easy the presidentinoffice president the the council the debt to give especially because the most political groups the in this sitting represented are also part of the the council
we are in this situation rightly has because the approach the the intergovernmental conference simply not more working
how is the possible that the union decisions the the constitutional nature if there three nights the pile
what is fact the sense been the the eleven months accept intergovernmental conference the two meetings in  and the many meetings the the council general affairs
applause
i would there moreover the want point mr the presidentinoffice president the the council that the costs of for account to the the taxpayers
how can there now decisions be taken the a reflects properly to are the the double legitimacy the the union if they be taken by a few party
i call you the the to not intergovernmental conferences more to the behind closed doors
applause
in the statement on the future the the union the statement the i behalf my group welcome the the for the first time referred the the need to renewal the the method the the intergovernmental conference the need to a wider debate which all involved parties the can let hear
a such method the already applied and the the conventions nine months a  birth
applause
while we the nice still not know how the child look will see
the seems i really sense to for the the the the future the the union use to make the the method the the conventions the applied
mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission gentlemen mr programmes conclusion can be said that there what the the issues the in nice the the agenda were and the you mr chirac itself has us the the statute the the european  company the social agenda the mad and the safety the sea the sufficient reasons are to to to that the summit a success is been
the institutional aspect other will further must be examined before we on can judge
now can we not decision take
we want a positive contribution make but the and the join i the mrs the president if we want to the our ambitions than must we the swedish presidency now to questions to the discussion this to open the must we with the most possible care to work to because that is what the union need has which we the positive way us defence confirm and the community method to development to
that is the challenge which we us now the see
applause
mrs the president mr the president the the french republic mr the president the the commission gentlemen colleagues my group is whole not to speak on the results the the fifteen member after the little  summit the nice have made the european citizens are really with gazing beaten by the lack the a joint vision the lack the only  and the mutual mistrust between the most european leaders
despite everything am i still somewhat relieved on the result that from the bus is has the mr cox has just rightly indicated that this result only could be achieved because the the summit absolutely wanted let succeed
the opponents the the enlargement would otherwise because called have that the enlargement would be off or in any case for indefinite time would be postponed
the peoples the central and eastern would here also from have concluded that their political future with the to the accession uncertain was become the is now moreover no certainly that the enlargement successful will has but the is in any case still possible to measures to take order this enlargement to achieve
further is the summit a good illustration the the  which the european union the is with the view the the enormous challenges which they with the to the construction the head must to offer the is here because not only to a purely institutional crisis
the problem the the fifteen member is not much that they effort have to the right answers the the problems to find but that they refuse the real problems the to tackle
the large numbers demonstrators the level for beginning the the summit to nice are raised have clear made for what issues there a solution must be found
the group demonstrators was not from a few nonarable  but from workers the the public opinion in their country represent
under the demonstrators were the also people the the the could the the european europe have been further were there people from the political electorate the almost any group here in the parliament
already this people were to same reason to nice raised despite their diversity questions they the all with particularly the what the sense is the the construction which the institutions must to be reformed
for who
which
where want the fifteen member with europe across must the will from institutional or thirty member there
must the go in the current global 
must the deregulation to the bitter end be continue
must the economic policy whole in the sign the the improvement the the competitiveness be the
must the essence the our societies whole supersede for the logic the the  so we in the yet must to to few exceptions the the rule to achieve must all power in hands to the a small  the far the the life the called and the the citizens from is
we must us than also ask or there alternatives are
i think the the choices which the majority the the citizens the can recognise and the joint projects in europe and the world which this citizens the rightly and with pleasure joint want working
the is to think the the joint control the the markets and the projects the economic social deny and cultural area which we expression can give the our joint political like further must the social operators better access to to the necessary information and to the comes and  within their company and within the institutions
in what has the european council a answer formulated the this legitimate questions the the citizens
the charter the the fundamental that if equidistant had must must is there the the summit the nice without further statement through said
the european defence with all   remind can the european europe i i also not the desired impetus offer
 for the situation is that our fifteen member last the a number tangible measures have can take with the to a number issues the our societies in their over did a number hopes agreements is now closed
i think the the issues if the food the safety the sea the statement on the specific nature the the sport in the light the the competition and the statute the the european company
in the social agenda find we not the achieve precise objectives but the a number points for possible action in the next five year
that is least already something but there is not clear plan and without joint plan remains the reform the the institutions limited to a  constantly cattle between the member
to finally am i just if my group the opinion that the european council the nice as can be if the final the a specific type institutional and political construction which the restrictions the the light are has and that are enumerations time has had
there are very what issues the already longer play than today but where we not choice can if we a open debate on the future the europe want into i think the the the lack the a joint coherent readable and inspiring debacle the refusal to a public and transparent debate to to on the possible options in name the a the is liberal consensus the ensure responsible is that any form the independence the relation the the established item with suspicion the examined the tightening the the power between the partners the this community and the special concentration the the power the the governments far the the citizens
i thank you all you
mr the president i price you for the staying which you during this  the nice demonstrated you given but further to my  not
i regret the namely that you your staying not you used to results to achieve with the to the issues the the table are the
you you us let know that the summit the nice successful must be mentioned because there a agreement is achieved
i am there however not the under the impression everyone was also that the french presidency to with particularly home political reasons to any price a agreement wanted the in nice
you not the however not illusions to make no late the here 
the disagreement the during this summit between the fifteen member was the the what we will can expect
everyone with healthy sense understand because that a future federal europe with or member many problems will cause
the most surprising is that you the this manipulates the a federal europe remains to while the opinion say that all european peoples here largely hostile the are
i like in the particularly behalf the french members the my group let know that the virtues the this europe be granted in constantly contrast are with the irregularities the the daily function the the union characteristics
people as you the the responsibility this to see the must to the still more with the manipulate the the media and the public opinion are to the
the is clear what method the the applied the proof the constantly to the future crop there be materialise decisions taken or decisions the only many later the implement need be the
the summit is less or more the you the this strategy the the 
first have the fifteen member in rush and with the  still in the view the charter the the fundamental signed
this particularly ambiguous document is by some presented if a extremely important text the if introduction the a future european constitution must must others as this charter other only but if a intent without only legal
this text is hailed if the democratic intimidate the the europe the the citizens course has no the wonder how the peoples this think
mr the president you you this text together with your first minister presented if the victory the the  nature the the french the chancellor schröder mentioned the text the victory the the german religious feeling
the may clear are that the french reading the the charter absolutely not corresponds with the german
that is really the when
the the summit the nice is further a european social agenda adopted but this document has not few binding gentlemen
in the social agenda the a number objectives mentioned for the next five year the member are however free to to determine or they the the this objectives want made or not
also is the the summit announced that there a agreement is achieved on the safety the sea
god  is there than last a crucial agreement on this issue
unfortunately the the here only a decision to the ministers the transport to ask agreement to achieve on the measures the affected must be
addition this wonderful result is there further the announcement that there a bureau for the food the up but that this bureau are doors not for will open
if crowning the the summit have the european leaders in nice decided to the institutional work in continue to to which the is to the clarification the the european treaties the allocation the a precise status the the charter the the fundamental and the competences the the powers between the union and the member the sorry i that i not more points can quote
the seems the if they a blow the the reject have been
this federal europe with are hypocritical cyprus and hypocritical formal agreements for the future start still more to seem the a frightfully that still higher the built but which the basis already  the real lesson the nice is because that this a enormous large historic  is which europe the since the treaty the maastricht still more in the direction the the imposed moves
without support the the people there there moreover not european people will the member under pressure the the public opinion in their country still more must stand for their national interests as must the in the treaty the amsterdam established and already outdated there members to be increase and must the number european commissioners be extended to while the current commission the the fifteen already not in the is to good to function
mr the president i like stress that france after nice again if losers from the bus is has from fear that france within the councils the ministers less control would to than germany you you the all other areas by the giving has
as will the number french members in this parliament be reduced the to i give to the is not large loss while germany the available remains the on are members and therefore not few member price not to give you would least the number french members must maintain for the people the believe that this parliament somewhere to must
the result is 
no understand more something the the rules the the the function the this environmentalist the basis are
almost everyone is dissatisfied on the reached agreement this applies in the particularly for the socalled small countries
the only clear result is that the european nations against like and thank be reduced to provinces the a authoritarian federal the the if we not careful the in service will to the the strategic and military objectives the the united states
we must this insane situation which the european nations their sovereignty the the union transfer immediately end
to the reason want we the president the the french republic ask to to course time the french people by means the a referendum to consult on this treaty
applause
mrs the president gentlemen colleagues i am really surprised on the masochistic tendencies the the french political leaders the the again during this european  have let 
after they the whole the the  had down have they then a treaty accepted that against any price in nice signed had be if the fate the germany that 
portugal and belgium have the this opportunity a important role can play than france that the all areas has admitted and therefore nothing has won except than a vague derogation the  this by the mr védrine thirtyfive derogation would both in the national if community needs must for
i think that even   the in are tools would order if he this would hear
our socalled leaders the not the ability are a  directives otherwise than the available or better said per decree the in the national right to to to accept here without was or  that the french representation in the european parliament with the reduced while the french members in this parliament the considered be to through the codecision the french interests to defend
for france run any new treaty unfortunately worse from than the previous already with the the in the logic the maastricht the noticed the the mitterrand would now the agree bad for us can effect
the poor mr chirac thought that nice him good would do and the mr jospin slavery also in the promises the gerhard if  in a universal peace
the will clear be in what situation already this people france have involved when the european bubble  and the french with a  are because they again are deceived by their bad leaders the only their own interests achieve
mrs the president mr the president the group regrets the that the presidency not result has given the the message the the in july had capitals
in nice has the presidency the technocratic power the the union increase
the crisis with the commission was obviously not the to the role and the function the the institution to reform
there is us only proposed to the powers the its president to increase i question i the or we as the bad function the the commission can prevent as that during the santer the the light is has
from the negotiations the the last days is has that there there was the a ridiculous cattle which the countries to the most  for more influence
only in will there about be on the redistribution the the powers and will the objectives the the european union be clarification the is however clear that standardisation the rule remains
there the about on parity between the large member but the is clear that the equality not there is one country the because additional seats allocated
what a hypocrisy
in nice had the the right the any member must recognise to within the council to be heard
one voice per member would to have enough the vote would than not endlessly again where need be to to assess or there the a qualified majority about can be
if we account had taken with the existing interests and differences within the council would we not debates need to on the number commissioners which any member notion
i i a commissioner hear favour for end the the exception the cultural area and for enlargement the the qualified majority to article on the international negotiations i must say that i personally after such speech the loss the a commissioner not as very think
this parliament would the like the a elected majority must express the the decisions the the ministers unfortunately this ministers must itself responsibility the to to the their own national parliaments
you you for a other model elected and that regret we the very because or europe or the individual member are the this model might
what the conclusions the the summit the must i with surprising see that there a large difference there between one the speeches on the services the general important and hand the dismantling the the postal the if agenda for this partsession the included
i fear that the in the social agenda included objective the full employment same fate is suffered if the services the general important
just if europe is also this presidency a failure
the common important is not might the the signature the a treaty which the solution against the wish the the citizens in sought the in the transfer the still more sovereignty
in follow the the economic and social council would i want say that the public debate in europe serious deficit inadequate
sometimes the the debate from ease avoid or reduced sometimes the there they that there not time for is sometimes take the debate the place but the there only but listened to experts and leading people and exercise only they actually influence from the the decisionmaking
there the than however the a situation which the citizens the not involved feel the the decisionmaking the however directly the them the application is
my group is disappointed on this treaty and concern on what the for us in issue has we will us than also the all ways against this treaty oppose
the the mrs the president mr chirac the am i that you in unlike to the previous time now the time you to also to my speech to listen
i see the a gratifying proof the the now montenegro or
when i the the result the nice was thought i the my old 
if two the the four tasks not were resolved was that for him relentlessly not
to sunday late was the assessment also for nice would
there was however however still a compromise achieved
a compromise means now once that the  not the achieved
however can we from austrian position with this result life
personally am i especially welcome with the fact that all stages the the  the the court be entrusted and in the first place that the european court the justice a  the
if austrian know i which i the i
the rule has the won the the political arbitrary
many speakers  the low progress the the area the the qualified majority
i looking that many must
where state and government the the certain areas reluctant have up will they after many hours negotiate certainly not for the irony their veto have used
the the basis of are heavy problems large concern and the fact that the like the the people not must be ignored but seriously seriously must be taken
how must the european feeling which often the about be promoted if with the concern the the citizens not account the taken
for many citizens is the still to quickly
for many is the port for the european union still not in sight
i think the better  and with consultation small steps to take than to a possible he to to one
worrying is in each case the mr poettering and myself have this moreover already for warned that the instrument the the closer cooperation if  can be used the the areas which not with a qualified majority can be certainly
the procedure would not only contrary are with the   but according i also a serious risk for the development the the union content
you thank mr hager
in this stage the the debate like i like again the floor give the the presidentinoffice president the the council president jacques chirac like because like respond the the speeches the the group
mr the president i give you now the floor
i like president jacques chirac you thank for are presence here morning for are speech and for are answers the the questions the the group
the debate the now cut and to at resumed
vote
mr the president to to start would i want questions that we for the vote control or there sufficient members present are for the necessary vote otherwise must we perhaps first the both other reports cases
there was namely only confusion on how long the adjournment would take we must ensure ensure that the compromise that we have achieved not in risk the the by the fact that few members not know that we there now already on vote
on the subject itself like i briefly a technical comment make
the is a complicated subject
we must the progress in the medicine support but account the with the protection the 
our commission has the report with unanimity approved
despite are there amendments tabled as the commissioner rightly has said
the is here to compromise with the intention to agreement to to with the council
the council has us offered the essence the the report the to take provided the wording the few passages the amended
that is the reason the this amendments the socalled compromise the three groups
i believe that this not only the position the three groups reflect but also the other groups but the have this to technical reasons not can sign
therefore like i the parliament ask this compromise the to take and the new amendments the other groups now have tabled not the to take to the compromise with the council not in risk to to
not because i content against this amendments am but because i the compromise with the council like retain and a conciliation with the council because the a amendment like avoid
with the view the this compromise like i the president ask that we on amendment that the the beginning the the list the only vote after amendment because this the compromise with the council represents and amendment the original position the our commission voices this last amendment would we only must adopt if there in the parliament not majority for the compromise the found
before the vote on amendment
mr the president to any confusion to avoid this we the compromise have adopted like i the parliament recommend against amendment to vote
that does with the compromise with the council
thank you the for your support
the president declared that the the amended common position is approved
report the mrs  a behalf the commission regional policy transport and tourism on the proposal for a directive the the european parliament and the council on the provisions the the area the the  com c cod
mr the president i would like want know or the competence the the european parliament for the  a new interfered the nice is
mr the president i i for this report on the regulations the experiments for new medication voted
before i the bergamo to strasbourg left i i the pensioner giuseppe rossi from bergamo this told
he has i said that he very satisfied was on this rules but he  that the the parliament to say that  the priority must to the the choice the the diseases which new  be sought and clinical experiments be done i i that like
elderly have namely not time to the experiments to wait in unlike to young therefore must diseases which especially elderly suffering the priority to
the group has the behind the report the the mr liese supported
there must because a end to the the large diversity the legal and administrative provisions within the member the the area the clinical experiments
further is the desirable to the development the medicines in the community to promote order patients better opportunities to can offer the a effective treatment
also must there a call to be done the the research and the ministers the health in the different member to more attention to to the medication for children twothirds the the medicines the children to applicable are for adults developed
of lack the data the the the to the licences for the in the trade to the medicines not look to the any consequences for the child
the the provide the medicines the children based the doctor the often the are own experience
we must the pharmaceutical laboratories than also to encourage to products to develop the specific for children and the fight the  for are as must harmful and type medicine the the body the children to are adapted
the report the dr liese provides in the the the shorter deadlines the harmonisation the procedures and especially also a better protection the with particularly children
what this last point the were the laboratories often discouraged by the complexity the the clinical experiments perhaps will this laboratories this demonstrated the good like the both many member if us parliament as if a encouraged to the market the medicines for children to develop also already will the extent the this market not large enough for them are to their investment back to deserve
the legitimate wish to in the union patients to protect the the experiments participate is moreover hand linked with the compliance the the subsidiarity
there must therefore very exactly defined be what under the to the permission what the
we are the opinion that experiments the people the not in the are their informed permission to give banned must be
in this respect are we than also welcome with the wish the dr liese to as strictly possible criteria the to to the regard the the permission the such people
we are moreover the opinion that in the national right must be down what under this permission must to be what
there must although clear rules to be up but the member must the right retain to more binding legislation the to to as example the case is in france
as can the subsidiarity the intelligent way be applied
 a
mr the president the pensioner   from   in the province bergamo my residence had heard the this directive and has i said mr fatuzzo i am really very old but i wanted that my time never was
but if my time really must to than like i that the in the whole european union same is
i request you therefore for to vote because the is good that europe a european time has after the european currency the european parliament and the european flag
i believe namely that the a good idea is final same  in all member the the european union in to to therefore i i for voted
the and i like my mr mary  like congratulate with its first report for the european parliament
the member must itself can decide on the up the a  but the is the rightly that the eu the dates the commit and end of harmonises
i am welcome with the agreement that the  in will to the the last sunday the march and expires the the last sunday the october
given the need the planning in certain sectors as transport communication tourism information and other technologies welcome i the proposal to to this regulation the fixed basis any five year again by the commission to let look
 is in the practice the normal time become
there is than also reason to a question to places the the understanding  because the is to seven the the twelve months that like say the the part the the year
the fr must we the difference between summer and  overrule that during the crisis was set if savings measure and to was extended
we can there not choice that this measure are important and usefulness largely lost has the the not longer the that this measure still up the are original objective the energy he has only still a symbolic gentlemen
addition the issue the the pollution must we account to the with the fact that the up the the summer and  in march and october the life strong can disrupt this applies in the particularly for children
in the report that the commission has let up to its proposal to area the noted that there not reliable data available are and that the existing studies other refute there the than also not only shortterm argument in this text mentioned to the difference between summer and  to maintain
the commission the however for to the transition the summer to  and inside inside for indefinite time the to to
they like summer and  the the member and countries impose without account to the with the specific geographical its the this countries
nothing no the the wish the the commission to all aspects the the life to taken even not the time
in  must the always just late are if in 
the benefits the the maintain the the  roads therefore not the against the benefits the the standardisation
long  the uniform federal time
the on the the subsidiarity must the member itself their  to can determine
the national governments must the this right not let reducing
they must other the wish continue role the the citizens by who they elected are
in unlike to what the commission proposed think i that we the difference between summer and  better can lift and in any case for france must choose for a system that the whole year by based is the  at
in the first amendment the the proposal the the commission rejected to the the summer and  based  for indefinite time the to to in the other amendment the the member and the european institutions the possibility is to the this regulation back to to
mr the president i would a vote want make on the 
the sorry i mrs but i i not notification for a vote the you
as you know must that the advance writing be requested
obviously is that not happened and i like you questions to understanding for the fact that i not exception can make because otherwise act we in fight with the rules the the parliament
than to we now further with the explanations on the  mr
 enough the now the mr fatuzzo the floor
i question i the what  him now something in the listen has 
report cerdeira mr a
the will you surprised mr the president but this time is the the mr carlo fatuzzo tourist the the gentlemen member carlo fatuzzo for are departure has said the the and to talk we namely for the mirror with other now you on the protection the victims debated must you not forget that i the last summer if tourist in spain am been
i am immediately to the spanish police has and i in a space the time declaration the theft done
but when i back was in italy gentlemen member fatuzzo the the tourist carlo fatuzzo had i to a new identity and a new driving the to questions still a time declaration do the the italian police and the 
for same  i i two time same declaration must do
this directive the the procedure  is therefore the i welcome
pt the status the the victims in the  the not still to properly protected
while this issue already since the beginning the the years s by different instruments the the council the europe the covered was they within the european union in the council only in the the item
the commission has during the preparation the the european council the tampere in a proposal tabled which they a series measures for the prevent the  and the to the assistance and aid the victims establish the urges they the the the need obtaining for the protection the victims from to legislation with particularly on the access to the judge and the right the compensation with including the the damages
this last proposal is the basis the the before report that on the whole taken our approval symbol we are particularly welcome with the simplified access to the rights the judge and the legal information and with the promotion and protection the the rights the the victims for what the compensation the loss and damage by adequate decisions the
we are very positive the a strengthening the the status the the victims the crime and we are than also in principle very welcome with the initiative for a framework in be that the portuguese republic has presented
we find the especially very positive that the the european level principles establish for the treatment the victims the crime the member must however itself ensure for the the the the details
we find the that a few issues details must be analysed and we point the the next
freedom the association is the fundamental important in a democratic rule and we oppose us than also against the demand that project organisations by the member must be recognised to aid to should offer the a victims the a crime
further find we public a condition for the confidence the the citizens in the executive and the legal power and we are than also against general rules the the press the links to where the is to reports on what to the is has during a public process
exceptions example secrecy on cases on  and pornography the the public the meetings the the court must than also to a precise defined minimum be limited
finally find we the a good idea that the can  example through a activities if the to take is that a witness or a  party from fear or to a other reason not who the truth can speak in presence the the suspicious
the and i am welcome with this report the my mr carmen cerdeira
the report favour ensure all victims the a crime in what those than also same  to guarantee
there would appropriate measures taken must be to the victims the a crime the next rights to can give the give and received the information  involvement the the procedure and access to free assistance a appropriate level the protection and privacy the possibility to a compensation to demands the a  and a the conciliation based weeded
the victims must be dealt if someone the the in a special situation the confusion and fear is the feelings the probably still strengthened be if the crime place in a other member than the the the victims
the and although we the content the the report support and many sympathy the can to for the victims the a crime where than also in europe i i if british conservative however my reserves the certain aspects the the report
i believe that we sufficient protection offer the such victims the basis the article the the treaty to protection the the rights the the human the the council the europe and this report is again a example the unnecessary european interference the a area that already the covered by agreements between the member and between other  the the council the europe
the british conservative party the not support the by the eu down measures the harmonisation the the criminal in the eu that must the competence the the member continue
the and mrs the president i i for hundred cent behind this report on a better protection for victims the a crime a report that again demonstrated the the the commitment the the eu to the crime to combat and our citizens to protect
we try here to achieve that the rights and interests the victims the a crime better be respected in all eu even when the crime itself place outside the usual country the residence the the victims
that means that many travellers and holidaymakers will can benefit the this european initiative
this measure will the victims the a crime in the to to a full immediate and effective compensation to demands for the ago damage if possible the the side the who the the crime 
fight the the crime is the crucial important for my electorate in the northwest
the labour run crime and  hard the
since the labour the the power is is the number crimes since already with fallen
breakins are with fallen and  with that are the lowest levels in the last decade
the already six year accept attraction the the number police is a stop to established and with the additional  achieved the number police a document record
in the  is with so words said that cooperation our next step will must are to crime with fields and  further back to can insist
the  have other nothing otherwise to offer than increasing indoors and  investment
their the the service the the area the legal and item clearly for the during their  increased the opportunity to victims to be the a using the the to the the opportunity to the victims to be the a crime with fields 
mrs the president the  is determined to hard the to act against the crime and the causes that hard the to tackle
by a greater protection the the victims the a crime all in europe to introduce will our citizens a greater confidence to in the system and the police not only in the united kingdom but in the whole european union
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
european council french presidency continuation
the the item is the continuation the the joint treatment on
the report the the european council and the statement the the commission on the meeting the the european council the to december to nice
the statement the the presidentinoffice president the the council on the french presidency
mr the president a point the item
this is very relevant for the matter the we here the this at discuss since the to make has with press and the independent property the the media in russia
a number hours ago was the owner the the bulk the the russian independent television the mr vladimir  arrested in spain
there is i told that he to russia will be deported
i like like protest been against this very serious development and questions to the matter to into
the mr  is the the this at in a plane the way to madrid the which he perhaps deported will be because are criticism the the russian authorities in are permitted
lord bethell i think that we the with you agree are
we will this matter look
we take there now knowledge the and course are our feelings same if the the you that the press in this continent served must continue
the fr mr the president the is now the i to the present president the the commission and the representatives the the almost has presidency the the council to welcome i like here stress that there still never so agreement in this parliament has there if now on the results the this summit
morning have all groups about on a failure
i think that the especially a failure must be mentioned because we since nice again a step further from are the the european europe and our european dream
which there now exactly this dream
the is us not to the achieve the a life or a area the consultation
for us has the european dream the the a continent which there is the joint values and that objective to political europe
we want a continent the neighbours the other if members the same family as and decisions to together a ship to build which they the storms the will learn can see
this presupposes the that we us joint project over the interests places
everyone here from the criticism that there in nice not there was the a joint project the was only to interests
the was if the construction the the ship already was completed and now the no  and cargo divided had be
that is the reason why so members here the summit the nice if disheartening country
the summit was disheartening because the debate the has focused the the question who a voice more and who a voice less presented to to who is there if winner from the bus germany or france netherlands or belgium portugal or spain
no were the however are with the question how europe if winner from the bus could to
the results were really to despair the to be
there are future three different majorities need to a decision to can take a majority the the the vote a majority the the the member and a majority the the the population
also what the commission the are the achieved results disheartening
the commission was because not given if the body that the general important must to defend but if again a additional intergovernmental body  the the rule the the nepotism and symbolic the a been the also for the parliament are the results little encouraging
the opportunities for decisionmaking the basis the a qualified majority are because but slow has just if the codecision for the parliament i like further say that i subjected am on the fact that the composition the the parliament is the without that this institution this consulted is
to finally are the results disheartening for the citizens the again are excluded the this cattle on a europe which they necessarily never something will understand
the european dream and the european europe must again be arrested that is the objective for the third stage that like say the new stage the we now like
the fr mr the president mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission gentlemen mr programmes the is i the that there after nice fact there is the two europe programmes the europe that steadily progress meeting and the europe that the itself to strongly is
with the first europe objective i the the union the under leadership the the french presidency in six months time its work the six very important areas has completed
this presidency will the  like with the social agenda and the european company the has influence the the euro and the tax package the conference on the commitments obligations and the progress the the europe the the defence the food and the safety the sea the mobility the the young the recognition the the specific nature the the sport and the programme media plus and finally the important statement on the services the general important
however must we us ask how our citizens the summit the nice perceived have they want because know where europe across is and what the exactly like and in this respect seems the union sometimes the a  ship
there is certainly also there the good news
europe is because thirteen year after the fall the the berlin wall ready to the countries the the us the the door you to received
in this parliament have we said that there with a limited agenda work had be so the essential issues not from the way has can be
in maastricht could we dream on the euro
in amsterdam were we the area the freedom safety and justice and the chapter on the employment
in nice was the to the  the the distribution the the power we have given that during this summit the national egoism the it the electioneering
there are indeed not socalled leftovers the nice but was there in nice the there the a european spirit
we are this not the convinced
the the made the this sad balance the us clear that we a collective responsibility have this applies both for the small if the large member for the countries the the the could were the the union and for the countries the later are become
in nice have we ensure taken that the enlargement by can to there is however not there the a debacle a soul a ambition or a vision
we can say what we want on the feelings the our citizens but we are responsible and they expect the us a debacle and a european dream
i like like a number comments make first on the charter
sometimes to we the impression that the state and government during the european council the cologne if the were surprised were that they this process the the had the while they in fact afraid were for the results the this process would that
how can we accept that this charter are dream hope and ambitions end as shrug is become and that the status the this charter only in the the item the the there the even not about on a possible inclusion the this charter in the treaty
finally is the court the justice the only institution the strengthened from this process to or is has and the the charter in the community system can into before the state and government to the possibility to
a subject that directly the important is for this parliament is the issue the the qualified majority
what this point the have we all reason to disappointed to are
this qualified majority is because less far than expect
what the very important tax and social issue the are there at not progress made
also the the difficult to a qualified majority to achieve since there not the one but the three criteria must be met
this is still the that the situation regarding this issue more is become since there soon in the treaty  included will be the the situation for our citizens still harder will make
addition the issue the the qualified majority importance this parliament course also many important the the codecision
the codecision the not always by everyone just seriously taken
they would because nothing to make have with the democracy and would only a agreement factor are democracy is however also a issue the time and debates require the necessary time
we find the very important that this debate the the the the
sometimes were we the impression that the european parliament in nice only if redress factor was given
but mr bayrou let we now but confess that we itself responsible for this situation are
we have because not our wish in the with the organisation the this parliament express made
what the method the think i that there in nice from this view very interesting prospects are is
the state and government have just in nice recognised what we after the summit the amsterdam already clear had made namely that the method the the igc not enough is to europe progress to let make the does us pleased that there the a new method work the which use can be made the the closer cooperation
we hope that europe the this way progress will continue make and in the will are to a constitution the to to that is because the right way to our citizens new hope to offer in this wonderful construction the europe
the and mr the president despite the words the the president the the republic on the problems which the head had be into must we us with the view the the should in nice ask or the union now the really ready is for enlargement
the candidates can not very welcome are been with the diners the the competing to national power and prestige between the prime
us lowest objective europe was unfortunately a nonarable factor
for the decisions on the distribution the the vote in the council and the seats in the parliament would a more suitable place the fanatics the casinos in cannes are been in place the the  in nice with the mr chirac in the role the 
with particularly the lack the a reference to the charter is to regret the a hoping that will lead to legal and political frustration
my the fear is however that the united kingdom france and germany now in the will are to the delicate balance that in the during the the last decades is the between member the different extent and between the institutions to destabilise
we will us here with force against oppose
president mr the commissioner mr the presidentinoffice the results the nice are for us not if preparation the the eu the the enlargement
in the twelve enlargement clearly the the prefer on the reunification the europe
that says something
we many european citizens are reared after the second war in the hope that once a united europe a role in the world would can play the propose the the peace and the the welfare the the humanity the are own citizens and peoples
this dream seems after nice however further the than we hoped had
nice was because the the first place a attempt the the member to behind closed doors on the leftovers the amsterdam a regulation to take with if the concern the safeguarding the the own interests
but a effort to the eu to to rest to the enlargement the to can was the not
that is here by many said morning and i valuable they support the
if representative the the parties united in the european free alliance like i the commission but especially the council warn for the case the eu not more wishes to are than a intergovernmental the
the member the the the the accession prepare will the example the the egoism the our own member accept
the regions and peoples without the will also their account make
they will teach how they involved can win in scotland in catalonia in flanders if they in place the the federal stake to play choose to itself member to be with a guaranteed commissioner guaranteed weight in the council a greater number seats than they currently in the european parliament can 
must we than the dream the a united europe give
i think the not
we are compulsory our hope to to the the 
we wish that this a really process is which the balance between the institutions the the union and the the the member and the  regions must defined to be in respect for the subsidiarity
mr the president in george orwellian programmes book animal  the a judgement the in certain sense describes what there is nice is happened
the judgement reads if follows all are right but some are  than others
into to the events in nice would that can be all eu are right but the are the large countries the the service of
in nice autarkic the large eu not only the agenda but they  also treaty the their same power guarantee in a comprehensive union
a comprehensive union the under the treaty the nice a union the  is and which the small countries the full price for the enlargement pay
for the swedish negotiators seems the important to are been to the large countries satisfied to to than to to fighting for the own influence
therefore the sweden less vote than similar member
the is difficult to in to see in what the decisions the nice the enlargement the the eu fact facilitate
the decisionmaking in the council the more and the the also difficult to decisions to take
nice brings also more supranationalism and centralism with the that and that is now precisely which the eu not need had
the real problems the the eu are the lack the democracy and the lack the confidence the the citizens but the issues were during the summit the nice all not dealt
i can the sitting also inform that today the results the a  in sweden know are made which that that only cent the the population in the european union like continue
mr the president mr the president the the council mr the president the the commission gentlemen colleagues we must the french presidency and president chirac praise my the mr chirac has because the hands from the up into the significant used and are vision the europe clear made
the him can least still said be that he a vision has further like i president aznar the i congratulate
he has during this council the nice because are work can we also the british like i congratulate
they need because not more with the teeth the table to we but are now in the to bottomless a excesses in the wheel to to we would can say that they just if the tremendous dutch   know how you a victory in the waiting must where
us parliament and your commission mr prodi have however at not vision
our institutions are the there even not the aware that the murder the our commission the prepared and on few years place will find
with the new model the the commission that like say one commissioner per member accept we that will all important issues not longer the this institution but the the council to to are
that will the crimes for the commission mean as i already i indicated  us parliament would the the brusque that him during the council the cologne is  than that the the going on the issue where the all to is without supranational commission will there not there are the a federal europe but the a europe the the nations
that is however not what we want
the is five for twelve if we the way to the federal europe again want approach is there but one solution available mr prodi the organise the general elections for the president the the commission
the this way can we the commission the the necessary legitimacy for the commission and the parliament must work to specific objectives to can achieve
the parliament must further work with member as belgium that the during this council in the person the the mr  for this objectives has used if we this cooperation not the the on to can we the federal europe the forget and will there a europe the nations the that like say a europe that we never wanted have
the da mr the president the as good if front message the the presidentinoffice the commission and the government is that the that the treaty the nice the framework must the for the unification the europe
the a is already  than the another but the  is clear europe can now one be in a comprehensive democratic eu the the the cannot to thanks the treaty the nice close the the citizens the
this messages are full the gross and appalling chromosome the the truth the us remind the the the every from the history
the decisions the in nice taken are concern because closer cooperation rule by a power a charter the the fundamental controlled democracy and the construction the a military power
this decisions are not necessary for the enlargement while on the affairs the for the enlargement the necessary are nothing is certainly
the treaty the nice contains a number decisive steps in the direction the a  eu and same steps way the a europe the democracy and peoples
there is a increase the centralised power and the rule by a power if we this still not enough the had
are this the unification and democratisation the europe
no the is the development the the power the the elite and people is the  reality for eastern
we decide on the fate the the countries
the eu negotiating not with this countries
they have not participation on the treaty the nice and the eu the all conditions for their accession the
all the i repeat the all important problems the the the with the enlargement the integration the governments social and economic systems are not if problems recognised
the eu and its policy offer not solution they are precisely the problem
mr the president best mr programmes i can the very briefly the today
a small year ago has you i with mr tsatsos to the preparatory work for this igc sent
i can you today inform that our mission not is managed
the was our task to ensure to ensure that the european union democratic and extremely would be to prepared to are the the enlargement where we as to over
the union is not extremely become contrary
the guaranteed in the council the ministers is considerably more become and the obstacles are higher made
in the future will the many easier are to a  minority in the council the ministers to the to to
the decisive areas where decisionmaking essential is for a union the with member can function have we almost fully fail
the some areas is there even there the step
what the democracy affects have we us not taken the the principle the amsterdam namely that the codecision the the decisionmaking linked would be
the four important areas including the structural and article is the parliament the the decisionmaking excluded
this means that the democratic deficit is grown
further the the  the the european parliament against our own wish in and without the parliament to consult down
i think this unacceptable
the interests has crime celebrated
the winners were those the their national interests have quite
this let they the home the hands to
no based the that that he something for europe has done everyone says i i this or that blocked because my own national important by the lifting the the veto would be has
this method has are time had this method the the europe the the  has not opportunity
we must a transparent democratic europe the the citizens build to us to can develop
therefore must the the igc programmes in the future the method the the convention be applied which members the for the say have and not the  only as can we us continent contribute
further must also the process in the council the ministers a open parliamentary process be here must transparency and a  be introduced because as the now is can the not longer
this everything means that i no will say when on the treaty the nice must be voted
mr the president the next weeks must we the conclusions the the intergovernmental conference and the fundamental problems the the resulting strictly and indepth analyse
i like now not back the the considerations the different speakers on the method or the other issue programmes example the issue programmes the the mr brok just the the item has the
fundamental problems in the first place guarantee the conclusions the nice the institutional level not the continuity and the development the the integration the the greater union the the the point the to the
we can they a other name give than leftovers  or leftovers but the problems the in nice not adequate are resolved to inevitably back i think example the the transition to decisionmaking the essential leaves and the the procedures for decisionmaking itself
the experience will learn the what problems we must back or we that now fun find or not
the second fundamental problem has more the the the political than the the institutions
from the atmosphere the the council the nice the intransigence attitude which president prodi the had the narrow positions the some governments the the move defence the national interests or views the that unfortunately what that problem is the general european important the common european horizon is from the sight disappeared
the right answers the both fundamental issues institutional and political the the most negative legacy the the council the nice are must we seek in the perspectives the a debate the process the verify and drafting under the it the future the the union
let we seriously give on what there happened is
by a agreement in  on the treaty is a public crisis prevent as such public crisis had the enlargement the discussion the but in place of must we now the head offer the a elements crisis
for the europe the europe are a farsighted look and a coherent action need
president chirac like i say that we not to almost questions we questions that we not a step forward do and than a backwards that we not first the charter up and proclaim and the then not agree in the treaty dare mention that we not the score new formula the the convention think and the not dare proposals if a possible procedure for the 
we questions that the constitutionalisation with particularly mentioned the we questions a clear and consistently vision the the future the europe if answer the the feelings the disappointment and fear the the the document the the current or future union under the citizens life
this will we us working mr prodi commissioner barnier
we are that convinced that the parliament and the commission together in this direction further will to as they in this difficult year have done
mr the president the most result the the summit the nice is that there despite everything however a treaty is has so there now a place can be budget for the countries
for the other was the summit or the large historic important or very successful
i like behalf the group the the european liberal and democratic party five points the the item to within the if that i i

the is unacceptable that the large countries the small countries blackmailed
that is contrary with the whole 

the is tragic that the not further is has on the issue the the qualified majority
now the the eu slow is they not to act in the and the the decisionmaking more

the intergovernmental conference if method the decisionmaking and the exclusion are fashioned and undemocratic
in the followup must the citizens the the whole involved be

the next constitutional debate must lead to simplification to distribution the powers and to more democracy
the eu must a common constitution to

a new intergovernmental conference must not be used if excuse to the enlargement from to to
our new colleagues must if new members and the equal conditions the the negotiations can participate
mr the president president chirac has the negative reactions the many members the the results the nice banalities and they unrealistic  mentioned
in reality is the president who the unrealistic is if he think that we with a such treaty the union can enlargement
i believe not that the realistic is the to to for the own national prestige than for the governability the the union i believe also not that the european citizens and mass the dictator the their governments in nice have followed
the serious accusation that we the french presidency can make is that the debate a struggle between the member is become a  impudent fight for a like more or less in place the a content discussion on the policy the the union
from fear the relationship the equality with germany the the stake to to has the presidency without protest accepted that the approximately forty areas which the decisionmaking the qualified majority had proposed were reduced to less than the half
but also the those under the european member have the not very unsafe and end have they the down the a disappointing compromise
what the european parliament the only the commission has the legitimacy that defended
we hope really that this the last intergovernmental conference is been also because the way the the summit has let see that the solidarity in the community down is
the real winners the this conference are blair and aznar the  the europe
their europe the europe the the market and the the veto has won and not the our that the the democracy and the the sustainable future
a last morningstar hope is the socalled  and even that is by the french presidency with all resources up
few lack concerning must urgent be clarify in the first place is to far way we must earlier in action to
we want that the z such last in june a democratic process with if objective a european constitution the formulated and that this process the the end the the year in the the the the charter is in eight months up for a constitution is less than four year need
this is our next dictator i hope that we this time together with the governments can fighting and not still a time against them
mr the president there was said that a failure better was than a disappointing result
in reality has the the summit not want let failure but results are there also not achieved
contradictions and postponed decisions are the result
the charter the the fundamental is approved but the not included in the treaties therefore the has not immediately force the law
a european constitution is more than ever need
in the second place is the plan for a european military  approved
the effectiveness that the however still not clear defined the can only be guaranteed if they independent the the united states can action and the nato the given the is because completely from the time
in the third place the indicated that there a social agenda need is employment health education environment rights but the remains vague there the not said what obstacles there taken must be and how to justice and freedoms to guarantee
finally is the enlargement to the east and the south in the prospect the and promised
good but the institutional standards to the in the practice to to are not with security the interests and privileges have the prevail
the europe that we want is after nice not closer has but still still far way
the council can not more to the european parliament across the governments can not to the national parliaments across and this can not to their peoples across
mr the president the summit the nice had a historic summit must be or the beginning the a new europe a new century a large europe and a europe for all europeans
what a beautiful project eleven year after the fall the the berlin wall
unfortunately subjects the us the vision ambition foremost generosity and certainly
unfortunately
we know already long time that the institutions the the small europe not are calculated the the large europe
further know we that we a other vision the europe must develop and that we certainly the institutions must succeeds
the subjects us however the a vision and we knew not good what questions we had to the were we cannot and negotiate and have we finally in nice but what in other 
better not agreement than a bad agreement said the french presidency level for the summit the nice if i the good understand i reads now the message in the briefly better a bad agreement than at not agreement
certainly the agreement the nice opens the way for accession the the countries the way the we however must follow is  we must the footing the the brakes the and we know now already that the vehicle europe are destination not  will achieve
let we nice now but forget and look what there after nice must done i like in this context let know that i my hope i located the the plan the belgium to during are presidency together to work with a broad convention
we must something news think and the method change what that the i i my find the the a broad convention the will there from representatives the the european institutions the governments the parliaments the the member and the countries
this last group countries must course involved to be the us joint project that is the wish the i here wanted express
mr the president the result the nice is disappointing not and 
the possibility to act the the union is the the most points not improve
the result the the compromises the nice is not more transparency but more 
the democratic legitimacy the the european political is not increase in place of was the door opened for a creeping intergovernmentalisation the the european political and the for a still greater red
course there is a  there is a little light the the end the the tunnel that like i not deny
by the enlargement see you the and see we us all for same task the if monnet and schuman and others fifty year ago namely the develop the a method a structure and a vision for the future the europe
time was the to the half the europe now must we this for very europe 
the enlargement nothing this the opportunity but this opportunity mr the president the the council you you in nice let support
that is my main criticism the you
the can are that nice the eu calculations given to enlargement in the the
but the historic negligence the nice is that the decisions a vision lack for a union the member
the spirit the monnet schuman and others is where the in nice the has must while the as hard need was
in place of was the spirit the nice obviously that the the wondered how the can block how the can  how the the home the hands can let to if defender the national interests and not how the european union forward to help
if monnet schuman adenauer the gasperi and others as had action than were the european communities there never has and than had we now not european union
president chirac has the had on the government the that being that the public opinion more and other innovative steps still not understand and not accept
that can are
but that is especially the the fact that not few leader the courage has to the public opinion to lead the to feed and to encourage in place the its tagging to are
the is the  the europe that the the many the the want lead as few prepared are to their political fate with the association the europe to link
mr the president i am a the those the long have hoped the a miracle in nice a intergovernmental conference a summit a treaty which the european institutions would can be reorganisation and the enlargement would be help
the miracle is not happened
the clearest proof the the lack the success is the announcement the a new intergovernmental conference in and the quality and the important the the central arguments in the debate for the  the the codes the the powers within the union to the place the the charter the the fundamental
the miracle is not happened the the details the the decisions on the reform the the institutions
that the miracle not is happened is mainly to due the the settled positions the the governments and the their  and also the the lack involvement the the european parliament
the is a sign the shortsightedness because the parliament is now the only democratic legitimacy institution the the union
the miracle is also not happened the the discussion on the common or the the charter the the fundamental
the parliament and the commission have already declared that they the in eight want take
what shall the council that same to do
a small  remains on the enlargement
after nice can the institutions not more if argument be used to this against to the
the countries are the only winners the the council the nice for them is the way to the european union budget
only those the still have wolf in the strategic gentlemen the the enlargement can the together with them rightly on verheugen
mr the president all large incorporate the the european integration are in nice continue are and that will still years as continue
what however final shipwreck has ago is the comprises the the national governments to europe in to up the hope that the state and government itself if  the the european integration as is final the  behave
they have the europe a nationalist national  made
since amsterdam and nice life we in a europe the  a europe the national masterly and not the europe the the political integration
what was their to do
according article the the treaty on the european union must they a still reinforced political union to the to
but no the state and government have a any into for the idea the the european integration
returned from nice show they the proud not the what they europe have given but the what they europe have abstained
they its the flag the the national veto programmes the obstacles and the swinging
that is not the europe where we since decades on speak
that is the europe the the masterly
but now is the at has the the parliaments now is the time time that we let see that the parliaments are the to the power the the governments in to  and
speaker the by the president cut
mr the president a union to develop the corps is to twelve new member to received that was the task the nice
a european union the efficient transparent and democratic can function
because the countries from central and eastern wish a vigorous union a union the in the is to decisions to take
positive is that in nice a timetable is adopted with the to the accession the the first countries from central and eastern that corresponds with the  the the parliament
but what huge is that the council four days in  in nice more with itself is are been
not answer the the question how in a an union the institutions the the european union better can function
the council has really good for itself taken certainly there is only improvement for the commission and a small  for the european parliament as the a father befits
but the whole its stark the against the attention the the council the itself has given
four our  the
the the first place institutional unbalanced the council many commission and parliament little
the second the national interests have overcome
only the belgian head the mr  was the good exception
the third a democratic deficit
old deficits are not lifted new are 
finally the fourth the decisionmaking are home not from to to
the the all very complicated
if the mr prodi says that there not leftovers more the nice are than  i that to doubts
we can not continue with the lack the qualified decisionmaking the the essential issues
nice will the   like if the summit the the missed opportunity if the summit the the lack the leadership in europe if the summit the the against if the summit were the citizens the further from feel the the european union
mr the president the objective the the intergovernmental conference was the european union for to prepare the the at which they if comprehensive union had to function
i i makes the european parliament rightly are believe on the two conditions efficiency and democratisation
mr brok and i have if representatives the the european parliament struggle for both conditions but not the necessary result can achieve
we should however not hide that the both areas steps to the are the what the efficiency the are we in free many cases avenues the qualified majority the parliament has officially the right been to party to are in legal procedures on constitutional affairs the application the the closer cooperation is help and there is progress made the the issue the the european commission
also the the area the the democratisation are progress made
the codecision is extended to a free large number issues and the european legislator has the competence been to the statute the the european political parties the to to and useful preventive measures to take the protection the the democracy and the freedom in the member
unfortunately roads however for the european parliament the shortcomings the this treaty more there are different  which the parliament not codecision has been the charter the the fundamental the not in the treaty mentioned the european parliament is in not extent involved the the procedure the the closer cooperation fundamental sectors continue under the unanimity the vote the the decisionmaking in the council the content although the principle the the double majority but is free complicated become and has the balance between large and small countries the
mr the president if the the beginning the the new year the european parliament are final believe on the treaty must express will the for a large dilemma to to are this dilemma follows continue from the clause the in the treaty the nice is included for the developments after nice
in this clause has the view the the european parliament are up found according what the european union the with the to now to moreover intergovernmental method not more further can develop
this method is death
the clause for the developments after nice is although are  and absolutely improper standards the the to the the treaty but late however a light seem in the tunnel to a wording to use the my friend hänsch
the on the the indicated procedure must the new proposals for the europe the the future be developed by the political and social bodies and with particularly by the national parliaments and the european parliament
without this clause for the developments after nice was to i fear the treaty unacceptable been for the european parliament
with this clause is and remains this a bad treaty
before the european parliament however no says must the still agree deeply give
mr the president also i like i with the your  the the to the the gentlemen brok and tsatsos
i think that we any from our own blame excellent have worked with commissioner barnier and our contribution have made the this treaty the nice
extent the the words the the mr bayrou like i say that i here indeed already since morning is initially was i addition the president the the french republic and later only
i was the criticism modest and kind the tone but the is and remains criticism you spoke under more on a failure a defeat and a limited treaty
the is i moreover noticed that your criticism a unlike contains the us all in the smuggled the
europe is us common heritage but further are we here all nationals the different countries and properly we to different parties the criticism the the this treaty the nice and the the european union in the general the expressed is unfortunately completely contradictory or is that precisely a terms
some want something more the this others something more the that some want more europe others a socially or precisely a liberal europe
we have morning the most different opinions should some there is favour for more federalism and for less federalism
the is than also not surprising that no whole satisfied is i am the opinion that a european compromise per definition never whole satisfactory can are
i can from your speeches not how that this treaty the nice exactly is what we wanted had given the situation which our institutions and europe situation and account bearing with the existing positions on europe think i that this treaty the best result is that we could make
just if the president the the french republic am i i agree for to to what there happened would are if there at not treaty in nice would are closed
the consequences for europe would than not to out are been
the would doubt difficult are become to the enlargement to achieve i must moreover see that the countries the satisfied have shown
i think that without a treaty the confidence in the european economy would are has and that what the function the the union the we the progress the the last years destroying would have done
the french presidency is reasonable satisfied with the work the the done has the has because this institutional process three year after amsterdam and five year after the the start to the this process simply concluded
i like here like the few points the criticism the i here and the i heard take example the issue the the reweighting the the vote
françois bayrou demonstrated the the this point  and also great berès by the that this issue its here is
let we however not forget that this the first time since is that the vote actually  be
in amsterdam are we here despite the excellent work the the dutch presidency not in managed
now is the the managed to for this extremely sensitive and complex issue a solution to find
we have certainly not roulette played
i i also not the impression that the president the the french republic like the role the  the the wanted take
the failed not to everyone whole satisfied to to and therefore have we but tried to the dissatisfaction so possible way to take
a real solution for this issue was there not
the old system the the double majority was although simple but was also a to large distortion the the balance that is least our opinion and not much the position the the commission
we have an to a procedure the based is the a ordinary reweighting but since there not real solution for this issue to find is think i to should to that we everything in eligible considers a balanced result have achieved
against the mr sjöstedt like i say that i really the opinion am that the agreement not on the back the the small member is achieved
the new balance is not may for this member and also are there guarantees
you know that in the old system two large member within the european union a  minority could forms now are that there three
in the future europe with member is there least one additional country need to a  minority to can forms therefore not three but four countries
for the beginning the the summit the nice were the large member underrepresented there had therefore a new balance be set
further have we during the debate two additional socalled  added
the first a net the member for any qualified majority is least the the member need
the socalled small member have a urgent request to tabled
also to the least its countries the together the the european population represent the the vote within the council
in the second place is there the demographic net
i like here not say that the system there more the become is but the is least a balanced system
further is there here many about on the followup the nice
the is course not strange that this issue for the european members as important is we have there in this parliament in october and november often on about
as you know has the presidency never the important the the debate denying
you will however understand that the debate the the the difficult issues had concentrate and that there not followup the nice possible was as the summit the nice itself not had place i am however the opinion that we the debate on the followup the nice never impossible have made
we have our mind on this followup want let to there is need the other working
some have that here also indicated
the will than also not go are has that in the conclusions on the followup the nice about the on a comprehensive consultation not only the the society but also the different operators as your parliament further hope we that we the followup the the igc in short time can finish
i like elmar brok however with all respect let know that i think that the council not under the  view the the european parliament meet must to to
the parliament must the the the discussions the the council involved be but i believe not that more control or presence the the parliament the work can simplify
in our constitutional systems must the different powers strictly separate to continue
that is difficult
i come from the country that the separation the powers has invented i think however that the powers currently not separate are what sometimes to problems lead
the separation the powers is because a good system that are gentlemen in the past has proven
there must a indepth debate on the future to be held what the earlier mentioned contradictions the like i moreover that the those the a debate on the followup the nice the not per definition agree are on the objective of
take example the debate on the constitution some want a federal constitution while others a subsidiary constitution wish
before we the agree can be must we ensure ensure that the union can continue function
that is unsuccessful expected and difficult work but the must now first done be
the this reform are five year preparations ex has
the french presidency has its to a good end the but  not in complacency we are however the satisfied with the result
further will we together to look how we further must
the way the we must follow is down the enlargement is possible made
i like from napolitano the the this area many work has opposition let know that the state the government and representatives the the commission the not in first body with their own national interests have been they have precisely look how they account bearing with this national interests the general important could must
the is understandable that the state and government account must the with the public opinion in their country their national parliaments and the existing national sensibilities
i like the european parliament that point that we the european europe not on the men the the citizens or outside them to can regulate
this is a the the last times that i this parliament speak and therefore like i you to finally let know that i just if the commissioners and course the president the the commission already the many times with many pleasure to you to has am i would like still one comment want make on the role the this european parliament
you you all criticism expressed the the european council and the treaty the nice how fates this criticism also is been
i like you there however the point that your criticism per definition therefore also the has the your governments and the european peoples the they the legitimate way represent further like i not budgetary let that this european citizens the european parliament in are current composition have elected
let we therefore if commission european parliament and council any the place adopt the us is allocated the is not as that only a the our institutions here the ultimate important the europe defends while the other institutions cattle introducing
i believe definitely in the community method which there is the balance between three institutions the together progress must make
this are the comments the i on this debate this presidency and this igc wanted make
us work was not simple but i am that convinced that the in the future are results will positive for europe
the construction is by but we can not progress make if we not together the the achieve the us european ideal continue work
i thank you very mr the minister
i am there certainly the that the parliament will pursue with after to think on the relationship between the institutions
mr the president mr prodi mr barnier there are two points the i here would want explain
first am i in unlike to the gentlemen chirac and prodi the opinion that there the certainly the leftovers the nice about can be this leftovers have not only the the the fifteen member but the all institutional countries
the is course to the next two questions are we ready for the enlargement and what objectives must we achieve
not only the issue the the commission can if serving the nice as be since there the enlargement the the number votes the qualified majority and the a greater codecision fact not there is will the competition between the fifteen member and will between the institutional member increase with if result that the future the the european social model the undermined
what the followup the nice the must we a answer see to find the the next question want we the this footing continue with the fifteen member and will with the institutional member
we must distance do the the decisionmaking with unanimity the vote also within a future convention
the mr moscovici has what the next point the right
the european general welfare which moreover no the specific guardian is can not based are the the sum the the various national interests this interests main and wetlands other because
the es mr the president in my language there the expression away take the z such french the the application is the the departure the the presidentinoffice president the the council
i would than also my thank want express the the mr prodi the has is
the commission late will that they important the in the debate with this parliament
what the treaty the nice the can we not many say because we the conclusions the the european council still not to our available have and until we the under view have can we little add the what there already said is
to my idea are there two issues the regard which the european parliament a important role plays
the first issue the the charter the the fundamental
that the charter is become is a good matter
the is however not in the treaties included and the the nor mentioned in article member the the treaty on the european union
all i i however the feeling that the proclamation not official but rather a nonarable matter was
therefore am i than also sincerely grateful for what our president mrs fontaine and president prodi have said both for the european parliament if for the commission will the charter future to law serve and the will future actually the implement be the
that seems i a positive development
the second point which the parliament nice will assess the the enlargement the the qualified majority and the codecision the the parliament
to what i this morning i heard seem the reports i the this point quite vague and little promising
the parliament must the  the to to before are positions in be to can the
i remind i that enable tsatsos and i when we the report  on the treaty the amsterdam ortega y  the there rightfully the the old  quoted and said that we often for the choice are to the  or the way to are
nice is the way the to two important objectives lead and the enlargement is this a the
we know now that the enlargement a fact the
same applies for the euro
if nice was failed would that also a sensitive blow are been for the euro
therefore are we us in this parliament perhaps in a paradoxical situation the total from the the the amsterdam
perhaps will the european council the nice for this parliament not such positive results that if the summit the amsterdam
perhaps will the european council the nice for the european union however the the way open to a hopes future
mr the president we will that only can determine when we the conclusions under view have
far late the group the the european party in the central what position they will adopt
the and mr the president after the european act after maastricht after the treaty the amsterdam had this parliament the time the on the reached results
in each the the cases then we the conclusion that the treaties not whole satisfactory were that they not the already our expectations acceptable but that they nevertheless a step forward been and in any case a improvement were in compared with the status
we have than also still for ratification favour
this time are we with a treaty that least in one respect a step back means and demonstrably worse is than the status now i i the on the new system the vote the basis the a qualified majority in the council what the decisionmaking still difficult makes than the today the day already is
there the a  threshold introduced number countries population and a percentage the the vote that higher from must the than the this at the case is
the the at is the the the vote
that is already particularly high
the was the as such high level down to there certainly the to are that in what combination than also a such qualified majority also the majority the the population would represent
and now we this however already a  in had processed would the however possible must are been to the threshold in the form the the number vote to reduce
now seems the there however the that the threshold precisely higher is made i say this fact the in pending the the final text because that point would in the last at the the igc still adapted are
i will the result of evaluate as i on the text have
the is nevertheless a worrying situation
for the rest is the treaty a cocktail the unsatisfactory and positive aspects the unsatisfactory but nevertheless better than the status take i the least for what the the enlargement the the vote the qualified majority the enlargement the the codecision with the european parliament and the provisions on the closer cooperation
that is all a improvement in compared with what we now have even already is there not the already our ask and wish meet has
finally are there also still a number positive aspects the new version the article the the treaty the article on political parties and their statute the right for this parliament to the other institutions for the court the justice to where the that is also a important factor with the view the the exercise the political control the new formula for the european commission and the integration the the socalled  prodi in the treaty that a greater position the the president and the new composition the the commission means the a for i acceptable reasonable compromise where i i in the next time on will the and as my mr the mr tsatsos already said the there a way to the future down
this is still not end story
there will new reforms to and this must we use the make
just conclusion we have here to make with a  the good bad and  bad
we to the matter now in detail evaluate
i think that we ratification will recommend and that we the a new reform must to work but we must first still the small letters study to to decide or this indeed the right approach is or not
the and mr the president i must i apologise for the fact that my comments not already to good prepared are
i come directly the a sitting and because there not  are in the exhibitions the this building is the particularly difficult to to can follow what there in the chamber happening a you the hope the short term situation will be
many the us as the treaty the nice if unacceptable but to very different reasons
the large problem with the treaty the nice is the and that have already many people said the that the lack the any form the text the the this at impossible makes to us a considered believe to can forms
we know not or the  in nice a pandora the pandora with a active role for the commission have produced or a  for the democracy but what there this also in other is undemocratic the this at the the all  cleaned and we hope but that the final result the european union a like further will help
the two points which the according i fail has are the first the lack the democracy because the possibility to the public a critical look to giving the the function the the council was ignored although many the us were that the time this ready was and the second the  redistribution the the vote which for the council a other approach was elected than for the parliament
many people the the treaty the nice look to the ask why the the this way had
personally am i the opinion that the a redistribution the the vote account taken one to be with the population as we that do in the european parliament and as that also done had properly to be for the council
still a other reason to against the treaty the nice to are is the development the a still greater bureaucracy in the european union
who can a good reason give why the thirty sectors which now with qualified majority will be voted the essential important are for the enlargement
i think that the most the the countries the although they the treaty in are current form will accept because the there now once is and the door full for their accession the a given at and i hope that that at quickly will to and not to long the the will let wait the the points will look and as the most under us the will achieve that the not relevant are for their normal daily life
not reform the the common agricultural and not reform the the enormous  development
than still the integration the the charter the the fundamental if a binding mechanism that is the the already just as in the united states a reason for confusion between the courts in the european union
then still the fact that the basis the the closer cooperation the european parliament not role to play has although certain leaders the national parties the and than i i the also on the leader the the labour in are speech in warsaw the not reform in real terms the the structural has committed to
this is not reason for enlargement this is a reason for more bureaucracy and less democracy
mr the president the developments in nice are here already carefully evaluated there they however the reminded that the summit the nice with a particularly limited agenda the start is has
the council asked the european parliament this agenda not from to extend because he the only the the still unresolved questions the amsterdam wanted concentrate were to the force the the european institutions to improve and ensure to ensure that the europe the the member better work than the europe the the fifteen
what was the result the this exercise and this work
that that the most fundamental and most issues with the view the the increase the the efficiency the act the flexibility and the efficiency the the force the the institutions in the discussions not the mentioned are has
the council has already are attention focused the the power short the has in nice to many negotiators and to little the political done
in nice is the picture the the a europe which each the the countries are own interests seeks to defend what does suspicion that the europe the the future the stage the a continuing fight between large and small countries will are
i question i the or this arguments not in the card the the eurosceptics and the enemies the europe play
i question i the or the picture that nice has called the conscience the the myself europeans the them the more than only but a single and a currency want not up translate since the european idea i i the this at far find is
i consider nice if a continuation the amsterdam currently are we us in a transitional between amsterdam and the for planned igc which the not know when they will be completed
the is now the the myself  to the picture the nice destroying to do by to emphasise that solidarity sense is and to assure that the perfectly possible is a europe to the to to which large and small countries smoothly coexistence with other words all countries play a necessary role in the european integration and within this europe is there not place for national egoism
hence that i the parliament and the commission to call the  the the european europe not from the view to lose the is here not to the sum the the national interests but to a solidarity process as president prodi rightly has said to the future the europe
the institutions must the hands in other we to the enlargement to a good end to to we must ensure ensure that the citizens europe see as we want that they europe see and the politicians must the premises the the european construction again into in place the their power and with particularly the power the the large countries to defend
the es mr the president to my idea rightly is here said that europe from need born is and that europe there only but to is a step forward to to when the need very high is
and with the prospect the the enlargement the europe is in nice has that the need indeed very high is in the sense the inflexibility
as morning clear was and also afternoon when the debate was continue are the developments in nice the several ways to assess
just as the many other summits in the history the the european union has also the the european council the nice the reality prevailed and has the pragmatism the won the the utopia
although we all pleased had given that we greater powers had been the the area the the codecision the despite the disputes between the large countries between the large and the small countries and between the small and the mediumsized countries the is the however clear that there a series steps is taken the as president prodi morning already said than perhaps the not booming are but the in each case in the good direction to the steps are a increasing the the powers the the president the the commission a  which more decisions be taken with a qualified majority the although not so decisions if we had wanted a more definition the the role the the closer formulae and further why that budgetary left a reweighting the the vote in the council also already is the reweighting perhaps not perfect
mr the president nice is however not the point the the way but the starting the a new stage with a large number challenges
we must the accession the the new countries to a success see to make we must the european market consolidate the currency introduce a specific security and common defence to development to and the the give to a broad debate on the future the europe
mr the president the the commission we can we the challenges not into without the citizens in eligible to take
this is the matter that there with more proposing and more realism to work the has that the institutions the the community interests defend a greater input to and further mr the president that a any the this type conferences as jean monnet said the and this join i the the are important looking in the general important
mr the president mr the president the the commission mr the commissioner best mr programmes nice know winners and losers but europe one certainly not to the winners and the democracy and the transparency nor
that is fact the essence the what president prodi today ready and clear has said i like him this thank
let we the affairs agree the a together to the charter was not included in the treaties even not reference to
the the area the the security and defence is although progress made but this policy has still always not parliamentary dimension
the decisionmaking is in only very low extent extended but the procedure is more and  become
we have course the closer cooperation but what of will be the still to see
the relationship between the small and large countries is after a number totally incomprehensible and unacceptable proposals end sensible regulated further was the commission strengthened although the decision the regard the the number members not directly a sensible and positive decision is
minister moscovici has the without more the the right end when he says that the not enough that we this other tell we must the also the citizens tell
the is where that the citizens probably often more the the integration are than we in this parliament
with a better result had we probably sometimes more effort had to the citizens to convince we would however the more persuasion have if the result the nice better was been
we had with a better conscience a better european result the the citizens can transfer
i would therefore want back the something what today already a few time is said
we must us indeed detailed with the result deal
i am however the opinion that we us only specific with the result must deal if the council a hard commitment does on the further way the the process and that must than with a strong participation the the european parliament are
what here in nice on was said is i all many to vague yes against the participation the the parliament
but what for participation
i think the a scandal if we there again for must fight that there perhaps two representatives can participate and as possible the the most meetings
that can however as not longer
as the the convention must the parliament in this process a keeping role play
we want the government proof that we the better can
when we the convention compare with what there the the igc happening also already is the to a easier issue which the national interests a smaller role play than the the igc that give i to than do the convention and the method and the method the the convention the clear better
therefore am i the opinion that we us only must deal with the details the the result the nice when clear is that the european parliament the a future process a important and decisive role plays
we want the government proof that we the better can
mr the president mr the president the the commission mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues already my mr programmes have already out the the expectations the there with the to the summit the nice were in nice would there because for taken be that the european union the efficient democratic and transparent way would can continue function after the historic enlargement the us to wait the
i will certainly not deny that the this summit important progress are made with the to the issues the the life the our citizens directly influence i think the the the health the protection the the environment the social policy and the adoption the a statute for european companies
a another positive point is that the charter the the fundamental officially presented is also already has the the this at still not binding nature
finally can the decisions the the area the the cfsp now if a important step forward be as
this summit would a fully success are been if there with the pertaining revision the the treaties same progress was made if with the just mentioned issues although we there obviously the in are managed to a full cripple the the european union after the enlargement to prevent have the ambitions the the french presidency the not can into in a new draft
as is the number issues which future with qualified majority will be certainly in place the with unanimity the vote still many to small also the codecision will still many to limited be applied
further is unclear in what the number members in the future europe will increase and there there uncertainty on the number commissioners after the enlargement i would as still many more issues can mention
except the technical aspects the this reform make we us especially also ensure on the fact that the member still more effort affected to together decisions to take the the common important the the citizens must if rapporteur on the outermost region programmes the the union think i the very unfortunately that the conclusions the the summit the nice as disappointing are
they forms because not more than a confirmation the the programme the the commission the outermost region programmes deserve better
the european parliament will are work continue continue to this region programmes the place to give the their within the union s i am that convinced that i the can count the the support the commissioner barnier
mr the president nice was not success
in despite the the  morning the the french government is the igc simply not good completed
certainly the closer cooperation and the european  were the the on the last with quite what english limits
the most essential issue the being the reawakening to majority was precisely the crucial issues not the the on
taxation social security justice  agriculture structural precisely the issues the regulated had must be for the accessions are not regulated
the summit has here simply fail
national interests were greater than the general european important
and what additional serious is in a number cases where the to decisionmaking is has was not for in a were competence the the european parliament
the democratic gap is therefore still a little greater become
what  the summit to as little feeling for democracy to show
than the dutch position
during the summit seemed the the or netherlands there only but the from was to a type football with belgium to win
the result the already the energy was in place the the points in the weighting
what makes that group from the vote
fact why was france as  against the entitlements the the population
that is however a very usual democratic principle
netherlands has therefore one voice more been than belgium in the council
but look we to the number seats in the european parliament than falling netherlands the to and belgium the to
netherlands has therefore a price paid for that  in the council
finally the is clear that the traditional igc not more working
when there in again a summit must be prepared is the better the  to follow
late the representatives national and meps the igc but prepare
that has good work the the charter and that will also better work than a traditional igc
the is also democratic
president the i the nice simply a not
mr the president according a  was the first comment the the finnish prime   after nice this treaty must be review
we are the certainly with him agree but we know that the hope only after many years can be implemented if as i think that happening the national parliaments the treaty the nice ratify
hope demonstrated nice for finland and the other small countries the that the stress the the intergovernmental european role the the council the the level the the decisionmaking for the small countries constantly for lose will ensure
the the summit used no are european voice
if than the commission as we have given that the trying to do the its president literally the door out however my thank for the action
the is however regrettable for the future the europe that there not european pronouncements to find are
almost each country were are own home political problems the the summit to the
the told have the prime stressed precisely this home political problems partially to have overcome
we were in the the affairs in own hand to the or we were in the european decisions against to the  they in their country
as was for the countries a very bad example given which the the the tallinn to budapest and prague certainly will surprised
the is course good that the enlargement now by can to
the message must the the the countries give
after the enlargement are summits and igcs as the now have place impossible the union is now or really into or is 
the situation can not continue as the now is
i hope that there in europe pronouncements to find are the difference between politicians and pronouncements is that politicians know what the people now like and that  know what the people on twenty year really like
mr the president mr the president the the commission best mr programmes i am still not to the  members the already to in the details can out what there in nice is decided also because i the texts still not i
but if we something the nice have learnt and must learn than is the the that europe many to valuable is to the only the the state and government on to let
the model the the igc has are time had
that is the first and most lesson the we from the negotiations the previous week must draw
if positive point like i say that there will be work the a competences the the powers
that is a old demand the we from bavaria time again have the few years ago was this still  to  but now is the council there a decision on take
i think that a large success
but if i see how there in nice was  than think i that they better now already on the competences the the powers had about
perhaps was the easier been to this sensible compromises to achieve
formally are the leftovers the amsterdam resolved
in reality were compromises achieved the the the lowest lowest were
europe can the long term not be run when only with the the lowest lowest the work
i hope that also this parliament here the right lessons from form
the parliament must  be with particularly the the council otherwise must we fear that the bureaucracy and the secret diplomacy the in europe sustainable for the say will to
mr the president the is not simple to the french presidency to criticise in this debate because the not present is
i understand best that president chirac the mr vedrine and the mr moscovici also other important meetings must attend but i am that convinced that the president the the european commission the mr prodi also important meetings has as commissioner barnier and however are they as degree to to the end the this debate to continue
the mr moscovici says that we the debt not the him must to but the other representatives in the council
the is really regrettable that he not replacement has can supply the to the end the us consultation had can continue
finally hope we here with z such all that our levels will be strengthened with countries from central and eastern europe where the used was the the selfdefinition the the authorities and people the absent let to the people the a speech the and then disappear
i regret the particularly that the mr moscovici not  has know to find
is nice a success to mention
the mr moscovici says that we but the our national governments must door to criticism to make
that like i best do
the mr blair slovenia back to the united kingdom if a   because he the the one point not regard was infiltration the the other not concede had admitted and had fought for the british interests
now course can i him the support but what has he now actually achieved
he has us told that he ensure has taken that the enlargement will place
i know not or the commission the the end the this debate still will respond but in absence the the council question i i the or the commission there same confidence in has that this european parliament against also czech hungarian and polish members will counted and members the the baltic states
the mr moscovici says that you you hand course must temper with realism
i like him only but questions has general the de are hand  with realism or winston churchill
the public opinion will this never accept
this to we never by the house
o but there is a referendum
genuine
has the european union than not leaders
where is the council
where are the governments
the is regrettable and the only hope sign is that the european commission clear its about has recovered
this european parliament will the hands those we with the commission and that are that the our demands chamber
mr the president the summit the nice has let see that the intergovernmental conference its best time has had
we are the the eve the the enlargement the the union to the east a turning the the strategy the the small steps impossible makes
if there nothing the done the the democratic deficit the the european institutions can the union not count the the support the the peoples
in nice is a long list problems the the item been but the institutional reforms and the role the the parliament have not the necessary attention had as president prodi clear has made
perhaps were we to ambitious
that means however not that the the parliament the responsibility there
if we the lesson the the realists accept put we the charter the the fundamental in a la and to we us satisfied with a trade under the stability the the large groups and the national interests
something working there not the federalist young have that understand and have their state called more to are just as bold if the fathers the the european community
there must a large debate on the future the europe the the be the that is what there after nice must done if we the european idea again want launch in a radical proposal world
mr the president i will the briefly the because i like only but my thank express not only because you the the us as degree you behave but also for the content the your speeches
mr honourable we are here not from one has commissioner barnier and i are also has to to hear what your opinion and your feelings are how the vote is because i think that we the parliament and the commission europe together must build
we have in the debate the today not for other hidden taken with what parts the the treaty the nice we satisfied were and still less which we not satisfied were the arguments were not always same but the feelings and the reservations the
we have not for other hidden that we with same commitment and determination the for nice by must to the the way the the enlargement to our objectives to to for the most task from our history the the parliament and the commission the next years must role
we have also not hidden taken gentlemen members that we the parliament and the commission the new europe together must build this responsibility but also this important mission and this important perspective rest the us
the thank you mr the president the the commission
i i six motions received the are tabled the on the article member the the rules
the debate is closed
the vote take thursday to at place
budget continuation
the the the item is the continuation the the debate on the budget
the floor is the the mr wurtz
mr the president during the first reading decided my group a symbolic political act to out by a point to rejecting the the budget in to must
the wanted we the attention draw the a number specific characteristics the the when the us presented draft characteristics the in our view not by the unacceptable could
we have when again stressed that the principle new policies new appropriations respected must to be and have also the the revision the multiannual the the financial perspectives
we wanted namely not made the expense the the traditional priorities the with particularly the area the the external measures although similar problems the also arise the the expenditure the the area the the employment and the environmental
as we when clear have made wanted we in the future not by the council forced be a choice to make between two in our view just legitimate priorities the balkans and the mediterranean sea
today are we us exactly in the situation the we when wanted avoid
with the between the delegation the the parliament and the council reached compromise the the cutting the in the euromediterranean cooperation million euro less the relation the the budget
that is course a achieved signal the our neighbours the our partners in the south
for the balkans is with many effort a very precarious financial  in other the
the is under more there the transfer to the budget the appropriations from the budget the for were for support the america or the appropriations for morocco in the framework the the draft on fisheries the this year not are used
the most the is however that in the next years the financing with the to the balkans right means remains
we must also a comment make on category internal policy this the to programme entrepreneurship  initiative was reduced with million euro the transeuropean networks with million euro and the environmental with million euro
that brings us the in total approximately the the gross domestic product the the european union or even less the is the budget relatively given a the the lowest budgets the the last ten year
this is because clear below the already very low ceiling that in march in the framework the agenda in berlin was the therefore can the confederal group european united leftnordic green left unfortunately not its approval attach the the report the mrs haug
mr the president i like for everything emphasise that the budget the this year especially the work is the all members the a and same commission and course also the the president the the commission the mr wynn the the work and the internal tensions skilled in good jobs has led i thank also the commissioner mrs schreyer
that like however not say that we more and better could do i like the two sectors separate the
first the positive on to to start the approximately million euro agricultural for bse
that was a important step although in my view not final
than the approximately million euro for the central and small because the last clear is become that the european economy not is based the multinationals but the the central and small that the growth and the employment can encourage further is the growth the the appropriations limited to and is the contribution for the balkans increased
that is important in political sense in the cases have we during the meeting something nothing achieved
now two aspects which to my opinion better must be given and which i i ensure concerned the first the there perhaps a are use made the the flexibility
further are the new jobs simply the result the early retirement
that must not precedent create in our institutions finally like i the wish express that the commission more effort does for a  especially to our currency the euro to strengthen and to protect
fr mr the president mrs the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes mrs the presidentinoffice president the the council would i must say but i see its not
our sitting is indeed quite report but the debate is now once many longer like than we had thought and therefore will we the speakers after i and myself the base must discuss without the presence the the presidency
also i like the my on the rapporteurs the president the the committee the commission the council and the presidency the i congratulate with their work thanks this agreement can we now the budget adopt
i must i however fully already behind the comments the the mr colom i naval on the extremely delicate subject the the financial perspectives
there is just a agreement achieved in nice the the hand which we can to enlargement
well for the previous enlargement was many money need
the member were when however not viewed for the public opinion and the enlargement with spain and portugal was by with large financial efforts
if i therefore endeavouring that this budget lower is than the the the year both in real terms if terms percentage the the gnp and we also far from are the the in  the objectives aware i that this in fact the problem problem
if we this problem not tackle make we the construction and the enlargement the the union still 
mr the president with the the the the budget focused the discussion in this parliament the the a limited number issues
a the the issues was and is also today the increase the the financial prospects the the foreign policy
rightly rejected the council this revision because the has not sense to in berlin for a period the six year a ceiling the the expenditure to to if this ceilings each year the discussion be the
this ceilings force the commission priorities to to within a grace budget as any authorities must
a another issue that this year again  was is the flexibility
a instrument the million euro that now in compromise with the council down the for aid the the balkans
rightly notes mr colom i naval the that the use the the flexibility the this way are originally objective beyond namely relieving the unforeseen budgetary need
i question i honest said the the or he that also said would have if this instrument the same distortions way for meda was used as this parliament had proposed
during the first reading the the budget i i this criticism namely let hear and i can i are support not remind
course am i not against aid the the balkans
the union if cooperation the national states born from the need the peace in europe has a  to the process the peace and reconciliation in the balkans to finance
i think however that the a such extensive operation first the need the aid must be  before the  to draw
the fighting the the commission and the parliament the the day to to the balkans to for the a up the aid the in stark contrast with the cut the the aid the the countries
mr the president perhaps must we the flexibility for the budget already aside for the countries
whole unforeseen would they possible earlier member the the union want be
mr the president gentlemen ladies and gentlemen the the the the the budget was account taken with the principles the  and social and economic balance i like the rapporteurs this thank
the is also good that there for the central and small the main employers additional resources the available be the the will new jobs be created and as the the fight against the unemployment continue
we know also the were the the note the changes no the the commission
this the in that in category approximately million the savings this were is perhaps not more feasible
one is the euro now in gentlemen increased what the  will to hand can the there now already the take that the the the budget laid resources to over to to the the bse not will enough
there will therefore without more a supplementary budget must to which the  in this category strong as not to zero will be reduced
mr the president mrs the commissioner to to start like i our mr general rapporteur budget haug congratulate with the way which they its task has tackled especially thanks its are our work both in the commission if within the parliament in the general the constructive way has
the the this debate next vote will a point to behind the difficult and complex process to the the the budget the the european union for the year
the circumstances the us in the to the decision by to did are the result the your consultation and successive agreements between the various institutions
i would however few points want mention the also the the next years the application are
for what the appropriations the represents the budget only the the community gnp
in the financial perspectives is there the for to still but to silent the the the few years ago
also continue the multiannual the the area the the external cooperation retain the the gap between the commitments obligations and the payments increasingly greater late the implementation the certain programmes still still to wish on are there unacceptable and untenable payment the and has the the parliament for fait facts the the the the budget the influence are the first issue the the the gnp can far not be resolved
in the framework the the third point the the agreement between the parliament and the council on the drafting by the commission the a report that latest the june the the two mentioned institutions must be presented i i a important renewal in the is the intention that the commission report favour on the progress progress with particularly the a number fundamental areas as the payment in the framework the the backlog obligations the simplification the the  a better implementation the the programmes the revision the the comitology the reform the the commission the the and achieve the  with particularly on external cooperation and the media the the parliament the the several areas far the represented is
the is the essential important that this report not to the another mere invisible only than can the expectations the many the us the regard the this new step who in within to
the and mr the president sometimes seem we the the mutual  if you see how we other have are congratulate with this result
perhaps must i now however something from the the trend the regard the the council the not necessarily the french presidency but the council in are general
we need ourselves nothing i to make this is a good budget
the is not the budget the myself and many mr programmes with i like had given but we can there however the satisfied that are
in  would you the a the  mention
but because the flexibility believe we the  won to have
the original proposal the the commission for a revision the the financial perspectives to million euro on to can transfer the category to category was a good proposal worth to supported to be and expressed sensible
unfortunately was a large number mr programmes the not with i agree and to the reason could we this therefore not in go
there was nor a qualified majority in this house to back to the the article
therefore had we the a solution see to find with the resources the us in the interinstitutional agreement are granted so we however still a proper budget would to
and that have we than also done we have a crisis prevent by not appeal to do the article we have us taken the the financial perspectives even with the commitment the the flexibility
the reached result was the best where we the could hope without revision and without article
the mr colom i naval was with are comments morning because the for those under us the present were when there agreement was achieved on the  agreement clear was that the flexibility not in successive years for same purposes if be used
i i admiration for the answer the mrs parly morning but we have what that the indeed a eye 
kosovo and serbia that is in fact same
we have our agreements ignored
we have also said that the flexibility not a annual reserve for category would are but that is exactly what the become is
to the reason is the not only the mr colom i naval the frustrated is on the way which the affairs the in the last two year the regard the this budgetary developed have
the must i the the heart and that must record be that the french presidency a good partner is been the our attempts to solutions to find
for what the the classification i i not effort with the two points the were mentioned the pensions the in the category compulsory expenditure
where we the here on have is a regulation for early retirement where time still not legal for there no know or what there proposed will be compulsory or  will are and the is here finally to a token
on the agreement have we only but the comments for the aroused amended
with other words the comments on the noncompulsory expenditure
in not the both cases have we the the sums 
this require not conflict on to the
we must us not  that simply because there a budget is and we agreement have achieved during the conciliation already our problems now the world from would are
the problems will continue there to we a solution have know to find for the external expenditure
there are in the last year moments been which i as rather was to to think that if the commission once its proposals for a revision would have developed we the to a achieve would can to with the council
i had the wrong
when i there then behind was that there not discussion would to on the revision the point the the interinstitutional agreement was i the z such least said somewhat disappointed
the attitude the the council in this football seems that the to to that he the not to the court addressing as the match but continues
late i than just against the council say that we in this match still the a few balls behind the hand have and this team is the plan to continue him to we a correctly result have achieved
finally like i like all thank the the involved is been not only the rapporteurs but also the  the  and the staff the the group
mr the president in the first place also my thank the already those the a role could in the the the the budget the commissioner the council and the rapporteurs
i would also in the particularly the mr wynn want thank the thought i are first year fully through if president the the committee during a budgetary and i think that he the excellent done has
i am satisfied with this budget
i am especially satisfied because we this time also again within the financial perspectives are has
i think that the parliament the the agreements must the and this agreements can only broken be in effort need
i i the effort need this year still not can recognise
the commissioner is there still proud the and says that the agricultural this year with a wonderful percentage increase in compared with previous years
that is also as but that are agreements the also fulfilled must be
the were there already before they commissioner was and i think that the its to honour would serve if they the the the agreements the berlin would the
what the the budget further
we know all the content the the note the changes in october and if everything good is if the dollar remains the penny than would we in category a a surplus can have the approximately billion euro
i that the not would done and mr duisenberg says the happening not how to we than the bse finance
that is my question
to we cut the other expenditure the the agriculture to we the  to other years is there still a possibility to the surplus the to use or can we a insurance design what also already in a previous resolution the the parliament the
the es mr the president gentlemen mr programmes mrs the commissioner mr the member the the council ladies and gentlemen rapporteurs each year the the role the the european parliament the budgetary in importance to
the increasing importance is not just from the air the they is us to from under the the treaties although the council there sometimes effort that has that to recognise
with the voted was the last year for the first time the instrument the the flexibility used while there also a institutional statement to the was which the possible financial deficit the category was recognised
this year is in the haug use made the the institutional statement the the last year to the need to revision the the financial perspectives the the item to to
demonstrated is that the not the most suitable at was for a revision that the margin large enough was to the agreements with the to the balkans and the programme meda after to to without the perspectives the berlin to need change has is also that the fast to revision only to find is the those the time against agenda have voted
however can the european parliament not ever continue  the are external obligations
this year is again use made the the flexibility but the is matter that we not further to the this way
we are there not favour the that there in the  already a proposal for revision for the next year the included because we the believe the the world want wait we parts however are criticism that one the multiannual nature the the most external objectives the the union and hand the definition the the financial perspectives itself be the by the way which the financial deficit in category the realm
more than ever must also time a solution be sought in a correct implementation the the budget
the es mr the president mrs the commissioner in the first place would i the general rapporteur mrs haug the president the the commission and the mr programmes the the the discussions have did want congratulate with the excellent work that done is
the outcome the the consultation is positive which that that the there what the the achieve the certain objectives not to is that we the own isolation and as quickly possible the applies to but that we that all together do and time
we wanted because a budget which our efforts with the the the member would be united to the to to to the economic growth and to increasing the the employment the reached agreement on the multiannual amount for the programme for the small is than also a good matter
the to the this and other political priorities the the parliament must however not the expense to the the budgetary stability the the expenditure
the is where that the union since ten year not as such positive economic situation has experienced as that from the strong improved  programmes the the budget
precisely therefore however seems the decision with the to the appropriations i going reasonable because the efforts the be united and be most in the right direction with the view the sustainable growth
the the beginning the this millennium the there in the  the the parliament a distinction made between decisions one and control hand
the discussions have namely not only the the the  and their distribution but also the the institution the instruments which will can be measured in what the political like the this parliament in specific facts the into
i would still further want to because there can not be enough with strict and transparent rules in the implementation the the budget as the  the obligations the after two year not are carried
this rule must be linked the the promise the the commission that the human and material resources for the management the the different policies the fair and effective way will be divided that like say that there agreement must be achieved on the political priority the the parliament and the administrative priority the the commission
mr the president now we to a final decision on the budget for are has can we see that we a year the permanent fight behind us have which we have fought to the budget for other to to within the frameworks the are the when the financial perspectives in march in berlin were adopted
we can today the that this fight success has had
we will a budget can adopt within the mentioned frameworks and that is a large progress
i believe the to can say that both the member if the taxpayers grateful are for the fact that their contribute not still greater be
i think the also a clear progress that we the new year with greater margins than previously can start
when we cent the the gnp the the member use the that us the the margin which we ever have has greater than the margin the still not two year ago in berlin was predicted
that the us the possibility to a active role to play the the enlargement with the countries in central and eastern and the our contribution the the efforts to peace and prosperity to to in serbia and former yugoslavia
to this everything possible to make must also in the future very clear priorities be the
that will need are if we our obligations for the long term want fulfil and that is possible if we us the objective to to us in to to for a strong but same limited union
to my opinion is there the this at one large problem that us threatens namely bse
the is however important to the to to that we also this problem must overcome within the current 
that means that if the solution the the problem still more money requires this must be financed by savings elsewhere in category or because the member the the part the the costs the the take
mr the president best mr programmes i like my comments on the the the budget allocated sums for the environment and health and the consumer concentrate the a essential point
in the general to we namely the that a many to small share the the budget the allocated for the conservation and the  the the environment
this is more to  because the environmental a horizontal  is a effective environmental is because per definition crossborder
that know we all
therefore are the protection and the  the the environment also a task the the common european level
but that means also that we there last agree money for must allocate
we can us not continue to to the discussing on the general under enormous time the directives and regulations often the basis the to little  and without that this scientific based are
the you i to a comment to make i am not the only the permanent the impression has that he only in the commission environment health and consumer is to this the worst excesses to avoid the the us behind almost and 
the environmental must not be divided by especially small and local measures to support how necessary this also are nor should we institutions permanent and inappropriate continue finance which the results unclear are what i i the the european agency in copenhagen the case is
the european environmental there the the a scientific based framework
a such framework is there not because the basis there
we must last agree invest in scientific research and analyses
only than can we realistic prospects drafting for the link the environment and health with other policies and for hope realistic approaches to the problems the to tackle
only than the the money where we the for the our citizens on have sense and precisely spent
mr the president mrs the commissioner best mr programmes i like three comments make on what in this debate was said
the first you mrs schreyer has there morning the reminded that this budget a something greater growth some than a number national budgets but that us percentage the the gnp still always extremely low is and a example must whatever for many national budgets
the must the the public opinion also explain that when the national ministers the foreign affairs or others still more tasks to the european level shifting as the whole programme for the balkans the than not must forget that this money for need is that than also the available must be the
the second the the area the the common foreign and security is in the during the the years s considerable progress made
the time the the conflict in bosnia was europe still not in the with one voice to speak the the one country thought the that the the serbs supported the the other that the the on the the croats was
the seemed the the nineteenth political the alliances
now the the end the the decade the the end the the years s clearly europe with one voice is europe the the contribution the the reconstruction the the balkans greater than the united states europe has there with are budget and are political in important extent to contributed that there in serbia a peaceful revolution could place
this must the after a decade the chaos the the balkans for the european policy the the end the this year clear express
our external budgets be important and we draw our hope the the commission that they with the additional staff that they the also the work is that we the its expect
this are laurels the we you already give but you can that the the that we you in the future strict will try to control
there the many about on sights
what we in nice have given was again agree the national wording to the individual budgets
the the foreign policy have we that stage largely behind us left i hope that we the the next budget more content will decisions and less will  on national interests
mr the president gentlemen members i like like the a few aspects the in the debate were mentioned
to to start the structure the the budget there was said that the budget not sufficient would increase
i like however stress that the budget precisely a very high rate know namely
if we the to expect supplementary budget the counted will the increase almost sums the increase the all other areas or the now is to policy or the whole area the the internal policy research the foreign policy the administration and the preaccession is in total only
i like here stress that the parliament the the areas where the the last floor has a considerable budgetary the the day has the and however to a sound result is has with clear priorities
and than now the comment the the mr mulder you said that since the budget in the second reading within the margin the the agricultural remains the risk the a proposal rate must be included also because the not undesirable would are if the euro the relation the the dollar something would increase
i like here refer to the regulations the the interinstitutional agreement which the that a  to a amount the million by the agricultural must be financed and that then a appeal can be done the the financial reserve
i am however the opinion that we there indeed also the the supplementary budget the must ensure that the reserve the million retain remains so there not already the a low volatility the the rate other measures must be taken
the regard the the comment the mrs  that the environmental in the budget the the european union to briefly is like i that point that third the the budget for structural the spent the structural includes the principle the mainstreaming in the first place gender mainstreaming that rules that the measures the the structural the equality the men and women must promote
the money must further as be used that the lead to growth the the employment and the must that is the third aspect the mainstreaming as be used that the the good is the the improvement the the environment
also like i point the the billion euro the budget where we the morning on had this billion for the promotion the the rural includes many measures the favour the the protection the the environment
also know the agricultural a regulation the in the environmental not usual is and where fundamentalists also critical the would can are the culture the  measures the namely rewarded
this are measures the explicitly the environmental promote
i like also still agree like the the intriguing question the the mr colom i naval the morning namely what the difference is between a revision the the financial perspectives and the application the the flexibility
the is course rightly that you always the this question back
the answer reads according i if follows a revision the the financial perspectives means that when the the expenditure the the one on increase the than same must decisions where the the savings
the the flexibility there this obligation not
therefore is the resistance the the ministers the finance against the revision the the financial perspectives also as incomprehensible but yes as harder you always again something news
this the probably also the that principles sometimes important are than the reasons objectives
i think that the good is that we there this time than however in managed are to the flexibility to active and for serbia the necessary aid to make i am the however with you agree that the not our strategy must be that a european flexibility the country to country and the region to region form according there somewhere money need is
to finally like i again stress that the budget for the commission a good basis is to together a good policy for europe to to i like you thank for the good cooperation
and this good cooperation will we already in january the the treatment the the supplementary budget can continue
but first like i all  a happy premier wish
the thank you mrs the commissioner
the sitting wishes you also happy holidays to
the debate is closed
the vote take thursday to at place
common strategy the the union the regard the russia
the the the item is the report on the the mr oostlander behalf the commission foreign affairs human common security and defence on the implementation the the common strategy the the european union the regard the russia ini
mr the president the relations with russia are by the end the the cold war fundamental amended
there is not there more the fear for military violence or for a possible further  dictatorship
the attitude the the european union and its member is there rather a the a feeling the coresponsibility for the restoration the the russian society
the can be given if a type moral obligation but also if a important the the european union the now once not might is the lawlessness and poverty in a very large neighbour
moreover is the development the the russian federation for many the us still a dubious matter and hence that i i can proposals that also in this parliament this sometimes with hesitation on the thought
in each case the best what we can do in our strategy the relation the the russian federation is the follow the a 
one must we violations the the human and excellent  clear and hard denouncing and hand must we cooperation into in different sectors
both encourage are need to russia programmes development to a seems democratic rule to promote
this is a mutual important
that means therefore that we the gross violence in chechnya condemn and to opportunities must seek to the end the the war and the the relieve the needs the to to and presence the the european union and the the oecd this is therefore necessary
we know fortunately that the in russia not indifferent is for our criticism this
that is in many discussion that you in russia the the the item
also russia because like the same standards measured be if the we for ourselves accept
also a state comment the the  the georgia the recently taken are and as for in amendments with us
i expect that the next month a details treatment through the urgent will place and i for to in this resolutions only a limited fair the that debate to give
with particularly hope i the half the the green amendment the this point to accept
also with us criticism the regard the the still still not regulated relations between russia and the baltic states
the the last will the not are
the have there need the that russia also are affairs with them good regulating and out
what the the cooperation with russia offers the russian answer the the strategy the the european union good subjective
the force the scientific and technological cooperation with the russian federation is a good example
later as was the adjournment the the cooperation not successful with particularly because there little coordination in that type actions that to are between the european union one and other important operators as japan and the united states hand
the lesson must we for the future the i take
the northern dimension is a clear example the specific to programme cooperation
that understanding is in fact political about where
with particularly the the areas the energy concern for the environment the become the nuclear waste dismantling the submarines is this a important concept
also are there various forms the crossborder cooperation possible the the the the a drop avoid
in same framework apply initiatives for cooperation with the region kaliningrad
we argue a separate line for the development the the northern dimension the a coherent way as there also already a is for the cooperation with the three baltic states
i am moreover the opinion that the important the russia in the budget not really to expression is but we differences the that point with the social the opinion
if you the good look than is russia in the budget approximately line with something important than morocco and that true think i not
moreover can i agree life if recital g the this point lapses and therefore also with the social a wider majority for this resolution can be obtained because than the signal to russia more will are
the cooperation will the to we hope also functions to the foreign political
the resolution does a appeal the the commission if  and the the high representative if coordinator the policy
there are various areas to mention where subjective to find are as in the balkans the  and in asia
also would a more obtain discuss the mutual  are usefulness have which course for i and for others and for the most in my group the nato and there the link with north in  absolutely first the
we follow with large interest the development in the society and in the home political the russia
we hope that this time a real civil society to the is the the sustainable basis is for a real political democracy
i hope that the all levels contacts will be the between organisations people and through in the european union with  in the russian federation
as can the awareness the the values the we together parts better be distributed
mr the president russia must still with itself learn life decisions what for society the like build and are position in the world find
the development the the country is during more than presidentinoffice year balance and delayed by the monstrous communist experiment that was grown to a threat the us all
i welcome the report the the mr oostlander that the characterised by a extremely reasonable and balanced approach favour for constructive reforms and the finger the the the flagrant violations the the human
i like however a few comments make on our strategic relations
we must strong economic relations between the european union and russia encourage linked the political cooperation but we must ensure ensure that we not in a situation the strategic dependence into
as was the example proposed that the european union in the framework the the european defence which we still always reservations have a appeal would can do the russian  this the supplement the the already existing agreements between the weu and the ukraine
i am there for that we russia and the ukraine encourage steps in our direction to to and together to work with other allies the  i would there however not for to find are that we us in their direction they or us policy adapt and us to their observe
we would in a dangerous situation into if europe impacting on would be the russia
we have perhaps not on a strategic airlift but we have in the united states the a purveyor ally what that the am i there certainly the that the mr oostlander the united states not wishes to replace by russia if strategic partner the europe
the before the russia must we in as closely possible harmony work with the united states we should russia certainly not the impression give that there divided would are the the can exploit
that would in being important are
the second the is the large important that we the diversity in the energy and supply guarantee
approximately the the  in the eu is already from russia and a growing share the our  is from the  where the wellknown stocks greater are than the the the united states and the north together
many the the  for this imports are by conflict
the is in us own important that we everything in the work to to this region to stabilise with economic and political resources we must ensure concern to that we nothing take that the instability in the caucasus or in the southern region programmes the russia can aegean or worse
mr the president best mr programmes the common strategy the regard the russia was the first common strategy in the history the the european union
that shows the what important the eu importance the its relations with russia
the mr oostlander development in are report a  the cooperation and criticism the according my group right does the the situation in russia
a such strategy is however a complex matter because they requires that all institutions and member their policy closely coordinate and considered act
as the report the our mr oostlander subject is this long not always easy and we must there if parliament the ensure that we extremely precise to work to
now something on the most points the the report the is agreed that russia a important economic and  partner the the union is
the agreement on partnership and cooperation is this the  and when this fully the applied also the necessary instruments to to can respond the the most different developments
as includes the agreement a clause and provisions on issues in the with the construction the a democratic rule
our economic relations with russia are the last years subject been the extreme fluctuations by the different crisis
but in russia lack especially foreign direct investment this is still the that there a enormous capital the russian capital place
if this situation not soon from russia a stop the through by the the the a legal and  which a regulation would the created than is there despite the high oil not way from the critical economic situation
this can also a tacis little the change to not to say that the not more can are than a dice the a ocean ocean
the most task the the commission is therefore the effectiveness the the use the the resources and especially the visibility that to increase
i think that the the important is that the political responsibility the the consultants remains based and not the the amman
mr the president best mr programmes i believe that time again the underestimated that a achieve with russia a guarantee is for the peace in europe
that the immediately the important the the the strategy the regard the russia and same the your report mr oostlander
russia is however a difficult partner that was already said
although president putin the us the democratic development the are country guarantees is that not automatically a guarantee for a stable and democratic russia the democratic system is still always not  reality in russia
especially this is i i a problem for the cooperation with the european union we as the recognition the the people and  if the basis for a such cooperation and as have we the also the
therefore is the  the your report as extremely important
we want closely work with russia but we can not accept that russia war remains to against the own population in chechnya and that uninterrupted since a year
also have we sharp criticism the the provocative russian visa the georgia and we demands that this decision immediately the withdrawn
we can nor tolerate that the press in russia with being the into
i think that the  can ensure for new impetus in the cooperation with russia the is a important basis
we should not forget that also the european union ever a basis had in the form the the coal and  that the the basis was the sustainable peaceful cooperation between germany and france
and where are we now
as can also the  with russia a political dimension to
that means that we a common responsibility have for the peace in the caucasus for the environmental in russia and for the rights the the indigenous peoples there
mr the president with the  units russia must be worked so russia a european the the the to civilisation and culture objective
the report the the mr oostlander is critical and the the to cooperation an
with one forces must the crisis be  the year  capitalism in russia have caused
they to the not worked the the these
the is the people in russia now bad
there is not resources there are only  and 
the half the the population live under the poverty
the moral decay is large almost as in  and 
feared the that the number  in the next years to almost will increase and aids refers also to under the young
the the current contamination take place the people under than year
the birth falling the conceal rising and the population the russia  annual with a million people
that means that the the people bad is
a continuing pressure the the country is also the protect the nature and human against old mistakes
there is for tonnes the for biological waging fibre  through while a small amount already disease is
if result the the  must decades tonnage  be destroyed
the european union must russia help because they the the way also its own risks enact
the most area which must be worked is the energy that the the with the political the a large power the must example clear be through what route oil and gas the eastern to west be slow
today the day is already or the the gas the the eu from russia and on ten year is the european union almost fully on the russianspeaking gas
there is not north west or south which gas can to
the eu should what the gas and pipelines not geopolitical consequently the the united states be
for the russians is not the european union a threat but a  world under leadership the the united states
the russians are moreover however still not in the to the penetrated enlargement the the nato against to the the always through a militarisation the the european structures
we should not  are there must a europe the economic cooperation be built
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen mr programmes i i must we the mr oostlander tribute express because he has the the the important the the role the the commission and the with particularly the mr patten the for foreign relations competent commissioner the the implementation the the common strategy
in unlike to what other speakers for i said is i i this strategy to now to not success been
a proof of are the large financial scandals the still still the relations the russia with the financial world and with a number projects the the international community poison
i am the however not agree with the way which the mr oostlander the issue the the human and the democracy in the framework the the russian federation approach
i i a number amendments tabled which i with more urge the this issues interaction
the mr oostlander feels usually however not many for my amendments and the surprised i therefore also not that i they here not 
what with particularly chechnya the can we according i mr oostlander not say that the solution not only the military nature can are
the situation has clear demonstrated that there at not military solution is there can only a political solution are
the mr putin says itself and we would therefore behind continue the the mr putin that the future status the chechnya not the readmitted is
we dare however that not in us report to say and that is i i not acceptable
the is nor acceptable to bones that after half year war in chechnya our commissioner for humanitarian aid the mr nielson fact still not footing the chechen soil has the we must clear make that this intolerable is
for i is the further also unacceptable that the european union at nothing within in the with the murders the journalists the on the  in chechnya report
the is the not to few  cases but to murders the the regular arise
a member the my party a radical islamic journalist is few weeks ago in  killed in a clear by russian troops controlled city
i believe not that the commission and the council  should continue if the such serious things arise
what the caucasus the has the mr the orden completely right
we see that the however already terrible situation in georgia quickly backwards is
this country is completely unstable and the literally  by the russian federation
georgia  and the european union the not only specific answer the the refusal the the ban the the russian authorities in the with the 
they would other can answers with a withdrawn the the visa for descent the to the european union travel
they would can and must start with after to think on association the georgia before the to late is before there the the the threshold the europe a new balkans happens
president the current direction the the kremlin vote no optimistic
settle wants president putin clearly and ready for a amendment  under the motto all power the the kremlin
 wishes moscow the not to the the international obligations
the drafting the the russian diplomacy the the  in vienna the end november clearly in be themselves
not withdrawal the russian troops from moldova or closure the russian military transfer in georgia
how the the eu the fact the the the last russian delay mans georgia
the introduction the a visa for descent with exception the  and 
that is however total not to talk with the idea the the rapporteur the a certain extent the convergence between the foreign and security the the european union and russia in the caucasus
as give you because a wrong signal the  putin the a completely wrong at
these days applecart the wellknown russian politician   again agree the western 
in denounces words predating he the  attitude the the west towards the within the the kremlin
quote western politicians understand russia not
more still they are afraid for russia
therefore choose they for the easier way
they want a friend in the kremlin have
what with russia happening with the population with the society that is the west to the just
the report the mr oostlander  that last without more  congratulate
and however outlines  our european tough with the phenomenon russia very dispose
mr the president behalf the liberal group like i mr oostlander thank and congratulate with are good drawn report
in the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence were we the most the our proposals accepted and the the final very we the report
in the report the in clear very criticism made the the poor use the violence which russia the in chechnya guilty has made
the shortcomings the the respect the the human and the democracy are clear demonstrably
the the other on the in the report the strategic partnership between the european union and russia supported
the like reinforced cooperation with russia
there the proposed the nordic dimension a own line to give and the support the russia already with already to increase
in the report the the develop the the cooperation between the european union and russia the the area the energy supported
the is for the union the important that the supply the oil and gas the guaranteed by alternatives to create
the in use take the the gas and  in the  must be up while the production in the regions  and the caspian sea and the crossboundary from technical must be improve
now the summit the nice the way seems to open for a rapid enlargement the the union is the the important decisive the problems the to tackle the the enlargement danger to cause in the relations between the new member and russia
especially for the trade and the mobility the people is flexibility need
the main solution is however that the cooperation between the union and russia such the into that the barriers loss
if the union the under must also on the internal differentiation that be consideration what again the problems in the regions can reduce
the the other on must be hoped that also the russian federation a decentralisation the the decisionmaking and a internal differentiation will consider which possible the borders will duty
the mean i example the create the special economic areas in kaliningrad murmansk  and other parts the russia the the the union borders
mr the president i like our mr oostlander thank for are excellent and extensive report for the enormous amount time the he the has into and for are openness for suggestions the others
who russia the outside look and the opportunity also direct impressions  the the country itself and the russian partners the the risk that he the selective way what to the russian reality sense what in are picture the the country with
the current discussion the the russian national symbols late see that russia several exacerbated know
one is there the national flag the peter the large addition the red flag the the army hand there the by double  if national  addition the stalinist single
perhaps are this opposite symbols also at not as far from other they defied because each the are way the authoritarian the
but also the spectrum between this historic  is avilés and the dynamic the the russian society can certainly not be reduced or reduced to the one or the other authoritarian alternative
my personal experience is that i still  am if i young outstanding and good trained russians met but that i by russian structures or the now is to mainly economic or even  still  dispose
we can russia the best help by the not rather the to point but despite the work structures or specific policy as the afford clearly the the denounce to to hand must we also positive developments appreciate without russia if whole to want  write or think
we can the outside contribute to stability when we the russia specific and clear signals give on how we the cooperation form want give
with the accession the poland and the baltic states to the eu want we benefit the the fact that russia geographical closer us is to are to the crossborder cooperation in the region programmes   and kaliningrad to strengthen
transport energy environment and internal safety are top the list the opportunities
already for the accession the poland and lithuania must by negotiations creative solutions be found for the free ahead the the population in the area the kaliningrad
and why would kaliningrad also not in two respects a pilot can be one for the development the the economic  the russia with the eu and hand for the  the russia by fundamental reforms as the country tax and administrative reform with our support first in this area to achieve
the the way can we russia the the eu made
mr the president the european union has the last years different documents on russia adopted the a good basis forms for close relations with the russian republic
the common strategy is a the this documents
despite already are contradictions one russia in the observation the the europeans without more to europe we have large important the a stable democratic and the economic good evolving russia that  the the international political part and this also 
the west has russia also need if important international partner for the organisation the the europe the after the revolution
because this interests has the union in the common strategy the regard the russia and in other documents the many area specific action developed
this properly the establishment the the rule and the strengthening the the public
also the construction the the civil society if important condition for a functioning democracy
the economic area objective the union to a common economic and social area the also russia includes
already today is the union with a share the the most partner the the area the reforms investment and trade but there is there the a macedonia sources potential
experts have calculated that the  the the european union with russia only third is the what the the on the the russian gnp and the vicinity the russia to the frameworks would can expect
the political area the the common strategy the russia for to a permanent dialogue the to to on political and safety and this a permanent mechanism in the life to to
the would interesting are to here further the in to to but this there unfortunately the time
in its  importance the eu large important the environmental and the the nuclear safety
unfortunately know the dynamic the the relations between russia and the eu also setbacks we need but to think the chechnya this has the relations strong under pressure the
the content and the methods the the by the regime the putin pursued internal consolidation will a strong influence the the nature the the relations have
we hope that the  partnership the a day perhaps a genuine strategic partnership will be
mr the president because russia economic and geopolitical as important is must according the european union an be to a common strategy towards this country
in the report are many commitment statement and especially also pious wish
this is not only because the large european powers the mainly pressure make to the protection the the interests the their own capitalist groups the must the however ask what the selected europe russia fact to offer has
economic growth
the russian economy  now already ten year long still further way in the conditions
the end the the moratorium waiting people
what for sense has the more or less good  shops to have if by unemployment low and sometimes even not agree unlawfully pensions and salaries a third the the population under the poverty live and not money has to the products in the shops to buy
democracy
under this name breakdown the mafia the official and the one mafia
freedom
the freedom the the restoring the the capitalism in russia has the is only freedom for a very on low the bureaucrats from the last regime freedom to the natural resources to tension and the money to western banks to send
what means freedom fact for the chechen people
i voice against the report and like the clear make that the capitalist economy and the western world not in the are the peoples the the russian federation nor if the most peoples the the planet progress and prosperity to assure
mr the president i like the mr oostlander thank say for are regarding commitment if rapporteur
if swedish christian give i my full support the the  the the mr oostlander presenting with one a strong consistently and patient criticism the all crime in russia especially the violations the the human and hand a to to a close the confidence based cooperation
in the considerations the the report the under   eight the also given the political union with belarus the important for the russian democratic legitimacy that president putin and the government the russia the clear and strong way the emphasis to the the large need the democratic progress and reforms in belarus with particularly in the light the the report that the october in  is tabled by the parliamentary troika the the eu the council the europe and the organisation for safety and cooperation in europe osce
mr the president i am the author the this text the support was in the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence
i i there with emphasis the that we clear must make that we the political union the russia and belarus highest seriously take
in following the the report that we in  have tabled have we there the first the out that the  parliament the this at not  has not the legislation can do not right the veto the presidential decrees has and not budgets can approve
the second being we that that the law a fourth part the the candidates for this socalled elections in october has 
the third made we the access to the media the the item the imperfect is in the by the the controlled system
the fourth being we the the administrative criminal the a call to the they the elections punishable the
belarus is therefore with russia a political union
the is the important that we clear make that we this union also what russia the very seriously take
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues issues are for us important and forms for not only country only a internal matter
the war in chechnya is such issue just if the before labour the the very drastic way the rights the the workers reduce
we have the with a boycott tried but that has not influence the the war had
the by the mr oostlander proposed  creates a way which i him thank
this is the first  from our history
diverse cooperation help namely the circumstances in russia to stabilise that is the first step
the second step is that we must try to achieve that the laws be observed then will economic development for more stability ensure and the fourth will there characteristics the a civil the
the result is end more human and this to we all to
the can the development compare with a building with many  where now in this report the possibility for the created
therefore is the to my opinion the important that there a opening is
for russia where now new political leaders are have we a period the cooperation created
we continue critical but we terminate not the contacts as we were after the revolution which the oppression by stalin and all horrors the this are followed
the is the large important that the nordic dimension in this proposal own money from the budget the i i itself for that the  if engine for this important project to act
there is namely need the energy this is money in to that money can also be used for the  for environmental etc
energy for foreign this must both partners work and than especially in the northern parts the russia which that country the to my opinion more must up
this is peace and this are not soldiers need to  to monitor
you you the plan a such project to support commissioner patten
the el mr the president few days ago has the duma decided the single the the former soviet from to to to the single the russia
the important is here not the music the  or the decision the the duma if such
the important is here that the majority the the russian citizens assent has expressed with a such decision
i question i the why this people not the  or god save the  have elected if a single the hope the something news i question i the why this people now return to a regime that many mr programmes if inhumane criminal etc have indulge
what was this decade which russia  are advent was the the free market and suddenly in contact was with the values the the west
know we not what this was
course is the responsibility especially the russia itself the the russia the the past and the date
affects the european union the united states or the other powers however not few debt
we had the on the mafia
where was this mafia a ground however certainly in the kremlin itself
who were in already the years the  and agents the yeltsin
who has yeltsin in russia with hand and handtomouth defended
invisible hands then this the the result
to what banks is the money in russia that from is the foreign loans or also the home accumulation
is that to banks in vicechancellor or algiers
that is to the large western banks
what control the this exercised and how function between two only the whiteslavers
i mean this to say that also others responsible are for this decade that also the european union a responsibility has
as we also from the comments the a number speakers have heard the the model the the leave applied
the model the the cold war is replace by the model the the leave
where are we than afraid for
is the the possible that the large european union with germany britain italy spain and already the countries the we in nice have given on the the russia
or to we a procedure the mutual dependence era as we with any other large power in the current world do
we speak here on a role for russia
what role had russia when the nato decisions took on a  the balkans and the was if the un which russia member is and the organisation for the safety and the cooperation in europe not were
course present we as this power the failed to the necessary
i mean this to say mr the president that we the attitude must change not fear must who but nor fear should good that we a partner must seek a partner the now our support and aid need has
i welcome this report the i and i like my appreciation express for the rapporteur the mr oostlander
this report was welcomed by all favour within the parliament with exception perhaps the those the with   to the however not as wonderful days where many promptly  on have written
the is a excellent report that as the common strategy the important stressed that we attach the the relations the strategic partnership with russia
the report confirms our socalled  the regard the russia this strategy  strong language on affairs as chechnya where i will the will back with a permanent effort to effective relations the to build based the shared values and cooperation
the common strategy and russia programmes  for the relations with the eu have a new dynamic the the the
the common strategy includes initiatives the the area the the foreign policy safety and crime
other areas which the eu trying its  to russia to to strengthen are the rule and the construction the the democracy the civil society  and crossborder cooperation and not to forget the initiative the the nordic dimension where a number members already to has referred
we support the economic programme the the russian government that the vital important is to the would to improve
the will the parliament know are that romano prodi the the last summit between the eu and russia a broad dialogue on energy has held
this are all areas where the commission a considerable contribution can make as the report repeatedly the
us programme for technical assistance with particularly tacis up already the many the the in the report mentioned priorities
the tacis itself where a amount the million euro that involved is is at the education the rule the development the the democracy and the civil society including the freedom the the regional media protection the  rights and promotion the selfgovernment
the action the orientation the million euro is at the institutional construction the economic rule and the improvement the the affairs and would
in are report stressed the rapporteur rightly that our delegation in moscow a greater role must play the the management the the financial assistance i am determined to improvements the this area by to to if part the a wider reform the the external  programmes the the european union
the report is also in the the nordic dimension
also we as this if a important mechanism for the regional cooperation and for the development the the areas in the northwest the russia and kaliningrad
i forward i the a close cooperation with the next swedish presidency to specific progress to make in the nordic dimension
this means that we our efforts must concentrate the important affairs if the environment where a number members the on had has nuclear safety kaliningrad and the improvement the the coordination the the different instruments
we are us aware aware the the fact that the threats the the environment by nuclear  and  outside company set plenty urgent tackled must to be especially in the northwest the russia the the 
this is a  task the a joint international and russian effort requires
the commission has a leading role played in the negotiations for a international agreement for a multilateral nuclear programme for russia
this negotiations are the currently in a critical stage and we hope against march important progress to make
further is the little that the environmental in russia the strengthened
that is than also the objective the the  for the russian federation that last june is started in the framework the our agreement on partnership and cooperation
i like a comment make on kaliningrad the agreement on partnership and cooperation offers already a institutional framework for our dialogue with russia on trade visas and 
further has the area already since can benefit the  the orientation the approximately million
we to the this at the last hand the a communication the the council the kaliningrad and we are are with the opening the a office there
itself look i to from to kaliningrad beginning next year to visits and not only because emmanuel on there are whole life has spent
kaliningrad is a important region the we must into in the nordic dimension
the all areas which i i about work we closely together with russia and to us sending benefit
we work the the strengthening the the democracy and the rule in russia and the the transformation the the russian economy
that is all very positive but there remains a serious obstacle there for the improvement the the links between russia and the european union and now i i the course on chechnya
the the last summit european  in october by president putin to that there urgent a political solution for the conflict must be found
i would there endlessly on can constraints but i like the gentlemen members say that we us serious ensure make on the humanitarian situation in chechnya
we are concerned on the violations the the human the constantly be pointed by ngos programmes as doctors without borders and human rights watch
we hope that we the next months many more progress can make the the raise the this affairs the the russian authorities
we make us large ensure to the fate the thousands refugees in ingushetia and chechnya the next winter
this affairs are the as such large important because we our relations with russia very serious take
we can this not just under the swept ends
we must this continue keep but as the rapporteur she says in are report must we the dialogue with russia the the the
as a member already has said must we the mistake the the beginning the the century avoid when russia after the  revolution the from the european affairs was excluded with disastrous consequences
therefore will we to the our common strategy build the the achieved success many the the points the the report the the rapporteur accept and all the russian federation a heart under the answers to
to finally a comment on a point where a number speakers the on has had namely the visa the georgia
we have our serious concern transferred on the way which russia the december unilaterally the visa has introduced for georgias citizens
the whole international community including russia the the in for the support the the sovereignty and territorial integrity the the independent states
actions the a the the countries in the region the this sovereignty would can undermine can serious consequences have
if a less strict visa the introduced for the population the tendencies region programmes or when this be from than the this right the support for the legitimacy the their to
georgia is member the the united nations the the osce and the the council the europe and the has a agreement on partnership and cooperation concluded with the european union
the country deserves our support
we to the countries in the region the to use to make the the  to their disputes soon the to to before there serious damage the
i like the rapporteur again congratulate with are excellent report on this very important subject where we in this parliament the next years still often on will speak
the rapporteur has a extremely important and useful intellectual infrastructure provided for our debates in the future
thank you mr the commissioner
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
time council
the the item is the time for questions the the council b
question no the h
the genetically amended organisms and crops since the spring are many cases the which in various countries the the eu genetically amended organisms and crops as cotton oilseed and transplanting in the environment be introduced
the some places are few measures affected the other not and in certain cases has this not few official communication or the place
also was directive eec in many cases repeatedly faults violated
how think the council the to act to such phenomena against to to and what position will he this in the immediate and further future adopt
the el you thank mr the minister for your answer
in my question was the however to the next there are cases been the noncompliance the the directive and spread the com programmes in the environment
i i you of examples given in my question
you brings i now in a very difficult position
the commission would must ensure the the compliance the the directive
that has they probably not done or bad done that know i not
the member would the directive in their national right must into and apply
that is in the mentioned cases not happened
i i there however from that this per accident is happened
what the modified cotton the has the us in greece example said that this would be carried
the a similar question the the commission was i the answer that the farmers compensation would be the and the modified cotton would be carried
can the council i now from this difficult position help
to who must i i up for further information
is exports the this type material the legally
that seems i not very probably this would i like a answer the want
i remind you remind that the council a common position on this proposal has approved and the conciliation on now the point approaches
very the procedure would the latest january must are concluded
in this common position the for in many more rules for the member
the can you i i than also a answer find the your questions
i i you all i the available disposal information given mr the member
mr the presidentinoffice president you you the with i agree that  a considerably benefit can offer for the environment the human health the developing and the science and the business in europe
there the risk that europe this benefits the the late cannot if the the late lead by contravention and not by scientific facts
the the summit the lisbon was declared that europe the most dynamic and  economy the the world had be
is the council prepared to the role to take by the sector the the biotechnology to support by to achieve that the member more licences to for experiments and more products allow
the fr i fear that we the this way in a content debate up are which we unfortunately not time have
i i must we always both the scope if the restrictions the the scientific progress good measure
mr the president i like say that this debate however urgent must be held because the bse has enormous consequences for the animal and the overhaul and the imports that
we have now the ban the the use the meal
therefore is the absolutely necessary that we quickly a clear position formulate because precisely by the bse urges the time
when think you that can be the that we in europe can have on feed without only genetically amended components
will there quickly a label to so the consumer that can confidence that there feed are without only genetically amended components
i would the this member same answer want give if the are predecessor
this is certainly a debate that must be held but the time is this according i not suitable
this is everything except satisfactory because this have we the time precisely
we have a question and should a supplementary question to than expect we however a properly answer the the council
therefore are we here
mr the president i hope that you protest will been the the council
i like however the just respond the the dissatisfaction the the gentlemen member i hope also that this the record because the can not something let through that not true
we are here are with something that very strictly regulated is the asking the council in very little time answers to give the a large number very precise questions
if the council that  would he demonstrated give the a both bolstered if also  attitude
i am therefore the certainly prepared to a such debate for to to but this must the the most suitable framework be elected
if i in one minute answers on com programmes from my american would suck would i irresponsible act and that would not conform with the spirit the this presidency
question no the h
the situation in chechnya how assessment the council currently the situation in chechnya and what attempts has he the last six months in the work the to a end to make the the bloodshed there
the council is still still deeply concerned on the situation in chechnya the violence take continue and the humanitarian situation remains extremely worrying very certainly now the winter for the door the
nothing the currently in the direction the a political regulation the the conflict
the council has during many meetings with russia the each possible level are ensure to expression the and tried russia to to they excessive use the violence and a any enlargement the the conflict to avoid efficient and independent into in to to to the violations the the human the  the the osce to help the the within the are tasks and to finally that to to see that the humanitarian aid the the the the
the council has there with particularly constantly the out that only with a political solution a end can be made the this crisis
during the last summit european  the october on in paris was this issue by both presidents the the item the
the mr putin has let will that he agrees with the need the a urgent solution
the was the first time that russia in the joint release the the summit a wording in the direction accepted
although the mr putin the opposition against a dialogue with the terrorists as he the as has he stressed that a distinction made must be between this last and those the to good faith for the independence the chechnya have struggle
the mr putin has fact confirmed that the  soon to chechnya back can times
i i however the that this to now to still not is happened
mr the president i i two short supplementary questions
the first has the council contact had with the under monitoring the the osce elected president  and other democratic forces in chechnya to a peaceful solution to find
the second has the council information opinions the the commissioner for the human the the council the europe
i have not on sufficient precise information to the this supplementary question to answers
i can only say that we in closely contact continue with the commissioner for the human
mr the presidentinoffice president the the council in the parliament have we vain tried the mr nielson the commissioner for humanitarian aid to they to a journey to chechnya not only to this a  to take but especially also to the humanitarian situation there seriously to study
to now to is that us not managed
would the french presidency us bring can are contact can into with commissioner nielson and him with a certain sentence can questions to chechnya to to and the very quickly
the commission will certainly the the informed be the the the content the our discussions
mr the president i like something say in the with the rules the is in this parliament usual that questions the oral not adequate can be answered later writing dealt be
i like the president the the council ask that our questions if that now oral not possible is least writing be answered
as you know are we are with a reform the our work
a the the in the document the vicepresident provan the the item set points is the way the the time for questions the the council and the the commission
we have indeed different times noticed that both the council and the commission if the members not satisfied were on the way that
if the council that wishes can he result give the your request and writing answers
we must not forget that the supplementary questions in some cases impossible answered can be in other cases is the difficult only rarely is the simple
mr the president i like but say that the under other  usual was that we answer were the supplementary questions
the president the the council must however know or he the mr  already than not has met
he can however not say that he this not precise information on has
i like system the what the president just said
the there not doubt that this time unsatisfactory is
i am repeatedly for the european parliament published and i this the the most different overlapping debates part
for this debate the the however not the hot that see you itself also the the but full does
there are here approximately ten members
this is not satisfactory or for the council or for the parliament
newsagents you the therefore not the
heckling the the mr posselt
listening you agree the you now just the
this is how than also ridiculous
i am you simple from to to how this procedure working and i i on also a letter sent the mrs the president mrs fontaine is the also with i agree
i i must the this procedure review and many easier make so the members precise answers can to the their questions this questions must therefore better be organised
the presidency the the council is mr the member not government or a person the presidency is a country that working with the services the the secretariat the the council we give the precise questions the precise answers the we have
if you you  as that is can the still the two at take
therefore must this procedure be amended or reformed
this like i the insist and that has nothing from to are with total was  mr the member
question no the h
the position the the council on the problems the the consignment the  alcohol is the council the the informed the the serious problem that the currently in many member the the union belgium united kingdom denmark germany netherlands and italy happens in the with the transport the  alcohol and the the costs the this with the of for the involved  and the the extremely high risk the fraud and smuggling
what corrections will the council make in the relevant directive directive eec so the ultimately precise and without  divided be between  and 
what think the council the the possibility to this serious phenomenon the to tackle by means the federal control between the long in the country the origin and the country the destination
think he that a such solution the very short term can be applied given the fact that the commission with its proposals and with the institution the groups the high level has indicated many important to attach the the solution the the problem and prepared to are the specific this in to to
the council like the gentlemen member remind the the during are last meeting the may adopted conclusions with the to fraud in the alcohol and sector
the has the council the the measures the the member and the commission the fight the fraud with  the alcohol and tobacco
the council has when also the summarise the the report the the group the high level tobacco and  approved
to finally has the council under reservations the the findings the a by the commission proposed study out the the important the a  if objective the long term
the council has also promised in pending of provisions from to legislation for the  implementation the a selective functioning efficient early 
since working the commission this
the council like the gentlemen member than also invite the directly to this institution to up to further informed to be on the details the and the progress the the the the above measures
mr the president i think that the question rather specific was
the author that like say wish has tried the to the commission to use this has him the informal way data provided which that that the situation in a impasse is has
this directive is the the problem is here and is under the shall problem the the fraud
this are we all sensitive for the community companies also considerable damage the they the not few way can coordinate or control
therefore i i i to the council must use
i take there now note the that you promises the this in to to
through a supplementary question would i like want know or you something can say on the deadlines the commission seems there ready for but if i the good i understand is there within the council there the only reluctance or disagreement
i would very satisfied are if you that can refute i will the how that everything smooth will has
i can you the position give the the council more general can i you say that the situation the the area the the fraud the the fraud with both direct if indirect taxes and the possibility to strengthening the the administrative cooperation the this areas subject the discussion are been during the meeting the the ecofin the june not as long ago therefore
the council has the the opportunity a report presented been on  that was up by the  the the september by the committee the permanent representatives was set
as you completely rightly said that from this report that the fraud in the community a worrying extent has adopted
all member have confirmed that they decisive are the fraud to if both the national level if in their relations
the council has the commission asked as quickly possible proposals to do basis the all recommendations which during the work in the  unanimity could be achieved
the is the with particularly on possible measures for the solution the specific  the 
the my know is on not disagreement i i can you without more the commission towards questions without contradictions with the positions the the council to must fear
has you the impression that the member now have on the opportunities to the objectives to achieve
i i the impression that the fraud many more  would must to and i think that the coordination between the member to the this at not the desired results has has
will the new measures the results the that
you you right the fight against fraud has the never sufficient developed
you know that we in the during the years instruments in the life have established this start now to work but i am the fully with you agree that this fight without whiter must be continue
we must indeed the direction from work
question no the h
the tightening  the french presidency the the council has proposed the socalled  the to more
 the in that a  example a  punished the if they people without universally visas or identity to the eu maintaining
in many eu the the  in that the company compulsory is the immediate interests to  in some countries the this joint with fines
the presidency like now compulsory fines introduce
the  is a effective way to to prevent that asylum to the eu to
many asylum can not the only and the visa to the requires are to the eu within to to
the  the therefore in that their asylum not in the eu can be dealt
in place of be this people there by staff the  airports and other strike 
eight the council this staff responsible to in fact to decide on the future the asylum
the by the gentlemen member mentioned proposal is a initiative that the french presidency has taken with the view the the adoption the a directive the the council on the harmonisation the the cartel the the transporters be imposed when they nationals from third countries the not on the necessary documents for admission have on the territory the the member transport
this text is the september for consultation provided the the european parliament and the currently in the competent bodies in the council dealt
the objective the this initiative is the implementation the european level the a coherent policy the fight the the scourge the illegal immigration and trafficking
the responsibility the transporters is a the the main the the directive
this be for all member common  introduced the the liability the transporters regulate by means the the the the  for transporters and harmonisation the the current cartel the the member
the is therefore not to the introduction the new cartel for transporters but rather to the harmonisation the the already in the provisions the the convention mentioned fines
i like the attention the the gentlemen member draw the the third recital the the directive which clear the the that the application of not breach will commit the the obligations on the status the refugees if the in the with the protocol the new york the january amended treaty the geneva the july
the european union has repeatedly confirmed that they large important importance the the respect the the asylum
this must however such be with efficient measures the fight the illegal immigration and trafficking
that is a absolute need and the european council the feira has this the council after the tragedy the dover called
mr the president i like the french minister thank for are answer
i think the by the french presidency tabled proposal however completely unacceptable according i has the only one objective namely asylum outside the eu to the and that danger in the practice to lead to a increase the illegal immigration
also are the not only refugees in the sense the the treaty the geneva the who asylum can be granted there are considerably greater groups the asylum can to
for this groups the apparently not exception made in the new proposal
i i also a specific question the namely what for competence staff the  and airports has to in the practice to decide on the future the asylum
if a exception the made for those the be as if refugees in the sense the the treaty the geneva how can the staff the the  the a airport in istanbul than in the practice decide on the fate the a refugee that is the question where the here to is
i think the a very relevant question because the the fate the refugees entrusting the example staff the  and airports
according i are the staff commission they have not few training the this area and their decisions are therefore completely irresponsible
that is earlier a opinion and not much a question
i repeat that we efficient measures must take against something that a from scourge is and a even tragedy has caused the must we however the asylum which the european union large important importance absolutely respect
this emphasise i expressly
there are countries where the problems arise and this work we the
the countries must than also the for the day to
i i must we this way however continue continue path
thank you for your answer
i like the next supplementary question to how large and enough is this problem according the commission and how seriously the the council the fact that companies immigration in the eu regulate for people without valid visa and universally violent
that was exactly also the subject the the question where i a answer the i try to give
i repeat this is a very seriously and very repercussions problem
question no the h
the proposal the application the all products with exception the arms has the council there problems that that this proposal the the commission that the agree serious consequences would can have for the already as been affected  in the european union the adopted without that the directly elected european parliament the any way the consulted
the recently by the commission tabled proposal for a regulation the the council to amendment the regulation ec no the the council has to objective the exemption the duties without quantitative restrictions from to extend to the products from the least developed countries and join the the the initiatives the the community the improvement the the access the the least advanced countries
in the in june to cotonou signed agreement on the partnership acp european community the the that the community latest in access with exemption the duties will have assured for the most products the the  programmes
in the proposal the account taken with the current reform the the common market for sugar rice and bananas and the that the liberalisation the the access for this countries gradually the must done this is a period the three year the with commit the january
in the proposal is there the access with exemption the duties for the products the the  programmes this means therefore a amendment the the by the community new system the general preferences
this this a measure is the common trade is here article the the treaty the application what means that the european parliament not consulted not to be
i can you however assure that the council this proposal with large attention at we the us with particularly on the consequences the the proposed  access will have for the community producers and on the coherence between this proposal and the current design for the reform the the common market in certain sectors
when i previous month during the time a supplementary question proposed was this presidentinoffice president the that the by to say i can only my previous answer repeat and are previous answer again for to read
this time give i him not the possibility to are previous answer again for to read but question i to a commitment and are assent
is the presidentinoffice president the agree agree that there on this proposal not decision must be taken as there not full assessment the the consequences for the union the acp and the least developed countries is carried
yes or no
the presidency and different member have already the the european committee the  letters received in the with this proposal the the commission they will the in their discussions account the
the real consequences the the proposed  access for the european producers will a factor the crucial important are in the final decisionmaking the the council
i like the mr moscovici same question to if previous week
perhaps has you my question because the many questions when not can answer
perhaps can you i evening a answer give in this more closeknit environment
the is to the role the the european parliament the the area the the trade where the question the the mr newton newton also the amounts
think you that you i or someone in europe would can achieve that the transparency and the responsibility for the policy the regard the the wto be increase as this parliament not real formal role plays the the control the decisions the the council the ministers and the european commission the the area the the trade
to my good friend newton newton to quote perhaps can you this question the best answer with yes or no
since this my last sitting is here will i again try from to to what we here the the do are
i remind you remind that the presidency here not is to the opinion the  or  to have here the also not this or particular government for you the presidency the the council is here to clear make what the a given at the positions are the the council
i can therefore if political responsible the certain convictions have the and the i i that assure i you also on this subject the but i matters i the the position the the council as that the this at is
you mentioned just the agreement the cotonou
you you the that aware that this agreement obligations includes on effects the regard the countries the not to the least developed countries properly and that this the right have to be consulted
not the both is here happened
consultation later enough not
you you the that aware that not only the  in europe concerned are but that the the with particularly also ensure makes in countries the strong on are the sugar bananas and rice especially in the caribbean area
i can all members the i questions have the assure that the council account will the with their comments
because the questions nos and on a similar subject to be they together dealt
question no the h
the directly risk by bse the persistent cases the mad have to large concerns led the the consumers but also the 
the decisions the the recent council agriculture have led to desperate the the citizens the the member on the risk the further consumption the poorly meat
when think the council drastic measures to take for the health the the consumer by change the the way the organisation the and the the criteria for the development the the  by use to make the cutting animal the vegetable origin as pulses what enormous consequences has for the cap the ban the the implement the beef from france or other countries where the a such problem happens genetic control the bovine and a ban the the production and the use the meal for the feed the ruminant
the council like remind remind that are policy number to objective has the consumers a as high possible level the protection to guarantee
he has with are recent decisions with particularly ensure want ensure that the consumers meat to offered that what that the so possible guarantees offers i think especially the the decision on the traceability the the origin the meat and the disposal from the chain the a list the materials which desire risk programmes by to
the way the when and to risk programmes the crosscontamination so possible to prevent has the council decided from january the use the meal in the food the  the to suspend
to finally should animals the over are than months and not tested are not more be included in the chain
for this not tested bovine will a  be introduced which farmers against prices compensation can be the
the council is the opinion that all measures together us in the to the by the gentlemen members mentioned risk programmes to avoid
what now the organisation and the  the the animal production the remember the council remind that in the decisions the taken are the the reform in the framework the agenda the focus already is the the the more encourage the the farming production by means the with particularly 
also has the council the december note taken the the statements the the commission on the production the  plants and this institution invited its analysis quickly further from to indepth and this the necessary consequences from to draw for the current policy in this sector and with the to the  the on we have the commission also asked as need proposals to do
the council like with already this decisions the confidence the the consumers the the european union restore
since he the however must the the the principles the the basis are the the internal market is he the plan the prefer to give the community measures over proposals for specific measures for certain member
the es in the first place must said that the presidentinoffice president the the council to my idea the question the the mr korakas still not has answered
in the second place am i the president the the council particularly grateful for are answer the my specific question
i think that the council right has had and in a high pace a number important measures has taken
that the not way that we us faced see with the extremely worrying problem the the lack the compliance the the agreed measures
as the council know is already in a ban set the the production the feed with animal protein for  cattle in the united kingdom as the the production the meal
the that that the measures the we time have taken their quality have proven
well the problem is that they not be applied that the hand the has with their compliance
therefore would i presidentinoffice president the the council want questions or the council us the security will give that the community legislation the observed or he us is guarantee that the existing measures on the ban the the use the meal the the production the feed will be observed
what inspectors will this be responsible
what controls will there be carried
has this problem the words in the council already been
i would like want that you i a specific answer the the the next question what guarantees will there with the view the the food be given that already the measures indeed be applied
i i the gentlemen member mrs izquierdo rojo reminded the the decisions the the council

the french presidency has the the from the the used for a european answer the this crisis the not only a  but also a social and a drop is
the french presidency has to the bitter end the the the need the this measures and the demonstrated given the persuasion you can that the the that france when the again simply member is the the european union and not president more will continue insist the all necessary measures
we can i i now how than also in very europe a policies the thanks this policies can we just as far to if need is to this disease to combat
i wanted questions or there also a assessment happened is the the measures the affected are
i i the impression that if the used drastic measures had taken the now not for such  would are
is that also the assessment the the council
as you know act we time basis the the knowledge which we the that at have i can the therefore not whole agree are with your analysis
i am there fact the convinced that we this knowledge must improve and that is precisely also the objective that we aim with the institution the a european authority for food the european council the nice has concerning during are meeting the the last week a portion taken
now must we this authority in the life to and i believe the to should say that the european authorities the aware aware are the the need progress to to in this matter
mr maes there the i said the no know the rules from are head the that you this second question not could to the members can namely in total during the time but one supplementary question to
this the author present is lapses the question no
i had understand that the services two days ago is informed that i the question the mrs mckenna would accept because we when already knew that they urgent to dublin had

further refers the european parliament in are resolution a minutes the the parliament the to the judgement the the european court for the rights the the human in the matter  mans turkey no that in the benefit was the the burden but still still not is carried and request the the turkish government the to comply the the existing and future statements the the european court for the rights the the human
is the council the plan in the framework the the partnership a clause the to take the turkey to compulsory the the to to the the justice the the international court the den hague and the judgements the the european court for the rights the the human from to to as the council the europe unanimously asking
yes there is a political agreement achieved during the council general affairs on the text the the partnership for accession the turkey as on the framework which the this the application having principles and methods be the
the presidency is very met on this result this is a important stage in the implementation the the last year in helsinki the preaccession for turkey
the council has not radical changes made in the originally proposal the the commission as that the november on was approved by the college the commissioners
only the priorities with the to the political criteria and the closer political dialogue are amended
there is not any the the proposal the the commission with the to the jurisdiction the the european court the the rights the the human
in the partnership to different references for to the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human
the the also reference made the the need the legal opportunities for restoration the the violations the the rights the the human to strengthen
also the the clear made that large important the adopted the the improvement the the justice and the training the turkish magistrates the with particularly the area the the human
what the issue the peaceful consultations the the accordance the conclusions the the european council the helsinki in the text the the partnership clear made that this a important matter is and discussed must be in the framework the the political dialogue between the union and turkey
turkey must as all other candidates all necessary efforts take to the existing border the to solve
i thank the minister for are answer
this question was the the a at which the issue the the partnership still not the was
i understand that you enough you by already the work the the last days and therefore will i my second question focus the the judgement the the court the the rights the the human in strasbourg in the matter  the court has turkey condemned because the  property notion in the occupied part the cyprus
in the matter  is turkey even two time condemned
is the council the plan this issue with the turkish government to discuss in the framework the the by him mentioned partnership
i i you mr the member very simple reminded the the general but nevertheless precise conditions including this accession was adopted
in the context will the discussions be continue with this candidate the who we specific demands to
this the author present is lapses the question no
question no the h
the fundamental and justice i refer to the answer the the mr moscovici the my question and supplementary question the november h the remains completely other why the council think that the application the the principle the mutual recognition the legal statements the the can contribute to proper achieve the the guarantee the the articles and the the european convention for the rights the the human the now again included are in the articles and the the charter
i think the guarantee as the right to the in person or with legal assistance the own choice to defend or for who not the resources has to to pay for legal assistance the right to the free to to if that in the important the the point is further the right to the to let help by a system if the the language the the court not know or can speak the right the a process within a reasonable term or the release in pending the the process
how can the council say that for individual cases as who the i in my supplementary question mention a mutual high the the also but only improvement will to
as the council the gentlemen member in are last answer clear has made will the procedure the mutual recognition the criminal judgments a better protection the the rights the the people possible make
with this mutual recognition the criminal judgments can namely the safety the the people better be guaranteed this by the improvement the the judicial cooperation the crime the the territory the the union the help
the continuation the into and the persecution the offences will than not more its to under the restrictions the result the the different national 
also will this mutual recognition ensure for a better protection in the european union this a in a certain member spoke court not more disputes can be by a other member
here is the to the application the the non commission in  same facts will not again judicial be assessed final statements will not more be disputes
this is a extremely important aspect the the protection the people
with all respect mr the president but i i the impression that the council again not comes or like like the the subject the my question
this time i i within a month for the second time fact same question
i hope now however the a answer
citizens the the union be in pending the a process unacceptable long held their are the time again extended
this happening with particularly in the prison the  in france and the when from the united kingdom and from other countries
i think the unacceptable that this problem under the swept the been and that we  be with the words that the mutual recognition the legal statements improvement will to in the situation
i like know why this however clear and simple question not the answered
the the right the defence in sufficient extent respect and will the mutual recognition to improvement lead
i will you say how the council your question interprets and what answer he this the
in the by you mentioned specific cases will the mutual recognition there not to lead that a court the confirmed which essential rights are violated as the right the assistance the a itself elected defender or the right the free assistance the a system
one is the to rights which all member their devotion have confirmed and the the common platform forms the the systems the criminal persecution and hand is mutual recognition a process that but automatically process everything depends the the the nature the the court
as the council in are last answer clear has made can the system the mutual recognition not improvement to the the area the the fundamental
i must say that the president the the council the  the questions sense to a type 
but i like him the great what further the the time to
what like the council do to ensure to ensure that the member will act as he just has described
what guarantee have we that the theory the you just has explained reality will be
i i here not additional answer the
i believe however that we the other across talk
i am you namely from to to that the council everything in the work the to the your expectations to meet
question no the h
the the mandate the troops the be used for crisis the eu will use to make the troops the for the crisis
what decisions are taken on the mandate the this troops the what basis will the troops be used and what will the purposes are the the working the this troops
the is the task the the council to decide on the the the to the a military operation by the union in the framework the the tasks
accordance article the the treaty on the european union must the council this decision with unanimity the vote take as moreover also the case is for any another decision that consequences has for the defence
the is however the task the any member to the sovereign way the national level to decide or he already than not with own troops part the the operation
the european council the nice has the methods note the the hand which the council in where a decision would can take
as would with the view the the take the a any military operation the committee for political and security a recommendation can do the the council basis the the opinion the the committee for military affairs
the council whose work accordance the usual procedures be prepared by the committee the permanent representatives would than the on of a decision can take
the decision to the take the a operation would than in principle the form to the a common action
the time is the central is the the european security and defence and the cfsp and plays a central role the the the the the answer the the union the a crisis
the time is with particularly responsible for the political control the and the strategic leadership the a military operation
the can decisions resort to take to the rapid become for very the spectrum the missions in the framework the management missions in the framework the the tasks as down in article member the the treaty on the european union missions for humanitarian purposes or same missions for peacekeeping  the  for management and also missions for 
mr the president mr the minister i like questions or there  are taken on the issue or there the the implementation the such tasks a mandate the the united nations or a other international organisation need is because accordance the international right there only the legal way attacks the the territory the other countries can be carried if this the mandate the a international organisation is granted
i like also questions what legal provisions in the council are the for tasks in the with crisis which troops be used
we have on a report that is adopted the the report the the presidency the the european council the nice on the european security and defence
the take the mr seppänen all necessary answers
the is a  report but the the the everything very precise the a together the
this the authors present are no the questions nos to and with
question no the h
the importance the taxes for the function the the internal market president prodi assures in a article in the financial times the november the this year that he not  and common  in the eu wishes by to explain that the taxation a matter the the national parliaments are and that must continue
also is he evidenced same article the opinion that there like the eu dynamic and competitive continue a transition need is to majority on taxes where that requires is to the internal market to let function
can the presidency the the council inform what taxes according him not the important are for a dynamic and competitive functioning internal market
with your regarding mr the president this is the last question which i during this time can answers
the question the the gentlemen member is on the opinions the the president the the commission the informal way the best the
the is therefore not the the council the this from to speak
i like only in remind to that the in the treaty legislation system terms treatment a distinction makes between one indirect taxes and taxation which harmonisation need is to the institution and the force the the internal market the article the to guarantee and hand the accordance article further to other to the the legislation the a direct impact have the the institution or the force the the internal market under this last the also the legislation on direct taxes
the decisions the the council accordance the articles and require unanimity the vote
also after the treaty the nice will this unfortunately under the unanimity the vote continue the
i like the french presidency thank for this answer
i like despite still questions or the the the on the the council agrees with this type very contradictory and unclear statements the the president the the commission
when the namely a confidential cooperation to the like to between the council the parliament and the commission is the unfortunate if the president the the commission with this type  statements is are judgement can namely not otherwise be interpreted than that he a harmonisation possible like make but he conceals this words behind a screen
again i can not comment make the statements the the president the the commission made would have
the question or decisions on taxation with majority taken would must be is in the framework the the intergovernmental conference discussed
as you know could unfortunately in nice not few progress be made the this area
the questions nos to and with be writing answered
the time is closed
the sitting the to at cut and to at resumed
stabilisation and agreement between croatia
the the item is the report on the the mr baltas behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the report the the commission on the viability the a stabilisation and agreement with the republic croatia com the c the cos
the el mr the president the is i a large pleased the plenary sitting the the european parliament today this report on the stabilisation and agreement between croatia and the european union to should present
croatia has considerable progress made the not only economic but also political and social level the stabilisation and agreement is the logical result the this progress
i like briefly like the this three areas
what the first the economic area the there the not doubt that croatia still very what efforts must take before the acquis community with the to the force the the market fully is adopted
croatia does however are best and the structural and economic reforms start clear results the to throw for with particularly the area the the privatisation where the transparent procedures and protection the foreign investment there is
with the stabilisation and agreement the the sent economic support and more in the general with the through community programme programmes sent financial support will the economic progress still more strengthened be and croatia the up can prepare the future accession to the european union
croatia has however not only long economic progress made also the political level is there there the clear progress
democracy and rule that is the outcome the the after the recent elections representing new coalition is made
they has not only officially its devotion contrary the the democracy and the legal strengthen of but brings this also in the practice with institutional and legislative reforms the example the area the  asylum and migration
shortcoming is that this government the has themselves the certain representatives the the croatian community in bosnia the the during the war arisen   again wanted up also has they the conditions the the agreements the urgently accepted and working they together with the international tribunal for crime in former yugoslavia
there be also clear progress made the social level i believe that i here the best a passage can read from the points the the council the europe
croatia has considerable progress made the the fulfil the are obligations if member the the international community and more in the particularly with the to the ratification the the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the fundamental freedoms the european treaty the prevent the torture and inhumane or humiliating treatment or punishing the treaty the protection the national minorities the european charter on the local autonomy and the european charter for regional or languages
mr the president after the changes and the democratic developments in yugoslavia after the stability and agreement between the former yugoslav republic macedonia and the european union and now with the in vote to to stabilisation and agreement with the republic croatia to the democratisation and normal in the western balkans in a positive when to are croatia can a special role a role the crucial important the play
the stabilisation and agreement between the european union and the republic croatia is if established
us parliament can satisfied are on both the agreement itself if the adoption of still for end
now that also from the conclusions the the summit the nice the only  was concludes how us parliament right had
i quote from the chapter western balkans
the summit the zagreb the november where the countries the this area where the democracy is returned for the first meet were was welcome with the historic changes in the western balkans the the first in croatia then in the  have place
the european council stressed that the pact a important contribution is and remember the the important the other initiatives the promotion the the cooperation with the countries the the region he confirms that the stabilisation and process the core is the the policy the the union the regard the the five involved countries for each the this countries will a separate approach be followed
the the mr the president in the report on the stabilisation and agreement the account taken with the new democratic developments in croatia and out the the european prospects the this country croatia is there in the during the this year in managed the desired following to find the the international 
the membership the the  for the peace and the the world the bilateral agreements with the efta the  with the  and the recent probably negotiations on a farreaching stabilisation and agreement with the european union are clear expressions the the genuinely the the since the elections the january in croatia the the place is
the european union has here the focus the want to by the summit the zagreb the november on meet to to
unfortunately was also during this summit again clear how fragile and  the internal situation in yugoslavia still still is
if the current yugoslavian the that to lead that in case the doubt all against all direction the not change would the the regional cooperation cooperative pact for europe the agree the whose can be at
now already start namely countries if croatia the the to questions or the forced regional cooperation not block the the mislead is the their own progress the the way to europe
croatia and a  serbia where to i hope the democracy the december can be consolidated can important factors the stability are in this by wars and ethnic conflicts destroyed region
the is important that the european union and also the european parliament everything in the work to to the process in this countries economic safe to to and to strengthen
also if the way the this countries to the european union still very long is means economic and political aid very simple respect the the principle hope and with this principle the in the  account taken
the must in this region however also the principle the distinction apply
croatia has important progress made especially with the ratification the the european treaty to protection the the rights the the human and the fundamental freedoms the european treaty the prevent the torture the treaty the protection the national minorities and the european charter for regional and languages
rightly the in the report the the european parliament towards referred
also the proposal attitude the the new elected croatian authorities towards the international tribunal for the crime in former yugoslavia bears the the a positive balance the croatia
croatia has the always if part the western if part the the western culture felt
croatia has now support and encouraged need to progress to can make the the way the the current economic and political reforms
the the mr the president gentlemen mr programmes the question or croatia a stability and agreement dignified is can also we with yes answer
croatia favour still more a stabilising role in the region
the development the the area the the democracy must positive be assessed
i must the however the emphasise that how welcome we also are with the made progress croatia according us the finishing still not has achieved
there must now new steps be the the the legislative reform and especially the the area the the minorities the press and the independent justice
therefore must the commission the the preparation the the stability and agreement precisely this points with a critical look assess
i like there further also the point that croatia attempts within to fully item the affairs to to in are relations with the neighbouring
the are really remarkable progress made
the is especially important croatia clear to make that are role in the stabilisation the bosniaherzegovina and the federation for us the large important is
the performance the croatia the the area the the stabilisation must precisely this be measured
for i would the result are if the eu in the stabilisation and agreement a clause would into for the linking the the economic support the agreements on costs the refugees
this issue must the other conditions be subject namely the the condition that in croatia the access to asylum humane and compatible with international standards is
i i must this issue separately be dealt and not part are the the agreement
mr the president our group supports the work the the mr baltas in the with the report on the viability the a stabilisation and agreement with the republic croatia
we are also the believe that the commission the right steps has taken to this proposal the implement to to
us i has the this task in record to a good end know to to and we congratulate the mr baltas with are effective approach in the commission
used have we european left criticism exercised the a number countries the western of the role the they the the breaking the the former yugoslav republic have played by the xenophobic the ethnic conflicts and other expressions the violence to promote to afford and the to flames what end to the the the croatia has led the this at now also the recent past the croatia a clear taxpayer the seems the i however a good sign that the european union a step forward does and contributes the the restoration the the tolerance the democracy the respect the the human and the peaceful society with the other republics and areas in the region
we should nor the suffering forget the the approximately dreifuss citizens the serbian origin the in a week time the violent way and with through the terrorist methods from krajina are driven and to serbia are must flights
the seems i important that the acknowledge that here a gross mistake is committed and course must the people the to house want return this the opportunity to
the the way would the proof that tolerance peaceful society and respect for other views in the balkans the certainly possible are as would the prospects in the region there very what rosetinted look
mr the president gentlemen mr programmes i welcome expressly the beginning the the negotiations on a stabilisation and agreement the the croatia the voice perspective
in unlike to the neighbour slovenia could croatia the after the independence in not such develop that the now immediately already candidate was
a third the the country was when in namely occupied and the croats were driven
in were more than croats from krajina from west and  driven
they could only in after the i i justified  the this area to their homes return
when they this arrived saw they that very their have and the was destroyed
the this  were if  however unfortunately also here established serbs driven not only by the croats but unfortunately also by the serbian brushed the same also in bosniaherzegovina and sarajevo had done
unfortunately are there also the this  terrible things happened
the must cause and result however not with other confuse
we have croatia punished for this  by the country our blessed to deny
any aid was banned
our refusal croatia to help has there however also the contributed that this country the by all circumstances wrong developed with wrong privatisation and corruption
the new government is now the many political areas a european way path they the the cooperation with den hague continue has apart the support the tendencies attempts in bosniaherzegovina and with currently strict regimen to to the the conditions to can meet
i believe therefore that croatia support deserves
croatia can a factor the stabilisation are in very the area
mr the president i am different years president the the parliamentary sitting the the council the europe been and during already the time had i the opportunity to many croats in their to to freedom and prosperity to hand as many other peoples the us continent  also they this to with the accession to the european institutions
croatia has in the during the the e century same problems must overcome if many the the member the currently to the european union properly
during the last sixty year was croatia the victims the a an  fascism
fascism just as in germany austria italy and spain a typical european  therefore
later are the croats the managed the yoke the the nazism the to throw thanks their persistent resistance against the fascism
also this adjournments forms a essential part the the european heritage
then was croatia again in the over the the mugabe until the fast to independence the it fourteen this new development was the the the by nationalist forces and other more by purely democratic purposes driven movements
the strength between both agreement in ensure that the croats again a period the  mugabe to iran were paradoxical enough was this authoritarian attitude in the hand work by their serbian  the occupation the a part the their territory and the wish the the war
now the peace is  and the democracy is consolidated has the croatian people for the way the the moderation and the tolerance the freedom and the respect elected
the has this option clear identified with the full participation the the european integration
with the accession the croatia to the council the europe has the positive development the the in the country started the to signs the final centre this important step forward has the way given for the stabilisation and agreement with the european union the we here today discuss
they brings croatia a step closer the the way to the accession and the full membership the the european union course enjoys croatia in this respect not treatment but must the the same conditions meet if the other countries
the there not doubt that the croats right have the this accession but also clearly the i i themselves that the european europe  is as in the achieve the gradually the croatia and the gradually the the other neighbours the the former yugoslavia lack
therefore vote we for the proposals the our friend baltas and link we us to croatia to continue support in are efforts to member the the european union to be
mr the president i am welcome that i must like the the excellent report that the mr baltas as various members already have said with such drive has up on the feasibility the the commission with the to a stabilisation and agreement with croatia
the is a very  year been for europe
let we not forget that the croatia was that with the elections the still not year ago a new way has path
therefore am i pleased that we the the end the this year negotiations with croatia can open on a stabilisation and agreement
we have very applicable a beginning made with the negotiations during the summit the zagreb two weeks ago and the first full  find monday in brussels place
we hope that the negotiations smooth will has and that we they quickly can finish
how quickly is to the certain informed not only on the us but also the the croatian convey the particularly good is prepared
given the progress the croatia the last year has made must i say that i there all confidence in i that we there significant shipping behind can to
that is also what croatia in the last months has done the has are neighbouring let see how quickly the political years in a country can be opposition if there sufficient vision and political courage present are
tribute the the leaders the croatia and the croatian people for what they have achieved
as has croatia example the courage had to the relations with the tribunal in den hague a other genuinely to give the croatian president has the the way position welcome that a country only really are collective debt can be forgive if the is what  people there guilty are
that is a way council the not only direction for croatia but for all areas where war be committed
mrs stenzel has there already the out that croatia is become to the partnership for peace and to the world wto and the country is still various other international obligations made
the new croatian government has the relations with bosniaherzegovina drastically review they has the clear themselves the extremists in through and the financial relationship with the croatian parts the the army the the federation transparent made
they has the initiative taken to  to the with the former yugoslav republic macedonia and slovenia and now also with bosniaherzegovina
also is they the democratic elected government the montenegro extremely bring been to the pressure the the milosevic to resist
same is the government started to in own country few fundamental political and economic reforms by to to which we the conclusion should draw that croatia in the will are to to meet the the considerable obligations the a stabilisation and agreement with the of
previous month has croatia as you all know with extremely large efficiency and diplomatic  the historic summit the zagreb organised
the seem i not bad results for one year
therefore i am welcome to not to say surprised that the parliament the agree is with us believe to quickly this negotiations with croatia in the to to
i can i largely in the report find
i am the there example our that agree that we our financial contribution the croatia in the framework the the cards considerably must increase
there is this week a group officials in croatia to to the programming the next year to look
i endorse the position the the parliament support
i know that the croatian government the the position the that countries the participate the the stabilisation and process the individual basis the their own merits must be assessed
any agreement must be adapted the the specific circumstances the the country and the the extent the progress the the country has made
that is the approach the us for view the and that that also from the speed which we us policy the regard the croatia in the last months have recognition
course want we also that the countries the participate the the stabilisation and process not only the role take the the establishment the reinforced relations with the european union but also with other
this is and that like i like stress not attempt to through the back to try again a new yugoslavia in the life to to
in our relations with this countries to we our own experience to expression
we have  against a enormous political divided
we have the problems the head is by means the consultation by to try to economic and political with other together to work
the is not as strange that we the countries the better reinforced relations with us want maintain the following seek the the european family same commitment expect
the last year is croatia affect and determined the way to europe path but despite the recent progress is there still a long way to to
croatia and other governments in the region will the strong must make for the return the refugees something what few members also already to the have the
there is especially also need the human economic and institutional reforms the draw the a actually free economy the reform the the property a greater independence the the legal power and the protection the the rights the minorities
also must there a important reform place the the area the the media there must an be to a actually open and pluralist  the meets the the highest in the sector current standards the the area the impartiality and independence with particularly the the television
we continue therefore the support need have the this parliament the the urge the our croatian friends to by to to with this reforms many will with pain and effort to the to
we are welcome with the support the the parliament to now to with particularly the regard the the important issue the the legal for the stabilisation and agreement
this is a important point for us and i hope that we can count the the support the the parliament if we you after end the the negotiations on the agreement formally to consult
the stabilisation and agreement can course only be closed if the parliament there are approval the the
with this negotiations is croatia a new age entered in are relations with the european union
croatia has the many friends acquired in europe because the role the the in the last year has played and the progress the the has made
course must the difficult in many respects still to but i i there all confidence in that the croatian people this challenge tackles that the this difficult way the reforms this way the to europe lead can make
the european commission look to from to croatia to help this challenge the to to and the are way to hand
as i in the beginning already said started the croatian people and are new democratic government this year positive
i think that the very important was for the whole region
we are the the croatia compulsory to the croatian people and are government the next years all possible aid to give and we thank the gentlemen member particularly for are way council the us to by to to the the path way
the debate is closed
the vote take tomorrow to at place
i like like all mr programmes thank the their contribution the the debate have made and the as good the their time have taken
that is unusual in this parliament
i will there from now also strictly the hand the the
reinforced relations 
the the item is the report on the mrs maijweggen behalf the commission foreign affairs human common safety and defence on the communication the the commission the the council and the european parliament on the relations between indonesia and the european union more because com the c the cos
president gentlemen colleagues when the commission a year ago its communication on the relationship between indonesia and the european union good was indonesia with a new advent government the way to a real democracy
now a year later is the picture many less optimistic
the way to democracy to respect for human to a good  and system to the eradicate the corruption that a long way with many obstacles
the stand against the government is large and the process seems to way
that stand against the democratic elected government is from different corners from military circles from the electorate the the corrupt  the groups fanatical muslims from circles the armed militias
the president is also still under great in the with the  and 
important is however that the vicepresident and the president the the parliament their faith the the president have expressed
the problem where the government that question the the most manifesto in the regions the in the past under the  were used if  for  and also were abused if 
the worst is the situation in   and the the moluccas
the is in this the incomprehensible that this spring the laskar jihad the opportunity was to with thousands to the moluccas to draw to the conflicts this still agree to aggravate
the moluccas counted meantime thousands deaths and few hundreds refugees
the this at there there a large fear also under the moluccan citizens in netherlands that the situation the the deliberating further will defuse
there achieve us reports that the laskar jihad again a offensive preparing under other in  but also to small countries if  and 
there be people out because they christians are
there be people locked in churches and forced the to muslim to 
there to even reports that the laskar jihad has said that with the deliberating not few christian  must task the ambon
there is simply there the religious terror
if rapporteur think i that unacceptable and i question the commissioner than also what the european union can do direction the government to further bloodshed to prevent
and than  
also this is there the escalation the violence
this weekend were there again deaths
previous week were hundred students arrested and four the them were death back concerned the their parents
also  are still still imprisoned
in our resolution have we emphatically the territorial integrity the indonesia want respect but the can however not mean that the people in   their own culture and identity must assumed
that type violence indicating the can only but the
i like with the the warning the the government in the united states the says that the violence must put
the eu would the this also the the must the
also in timor and  is the peace still long not restore
in timor block militias the regression the the refugees and be aid when
also the murder the the dutch journalist  is still not investigated
in  were previous week still three aid the death and beginning december fifteen
president the regional problem is the the at the serious in indonesia
in this the are the plans for more autonomy in the regions positive as the promises to more proceeds the materials the the regions to let
what the general approach in indonesia the to the affairs fact the the good on the
but precisely the problems in the regions continue manifesto
what role can the european union play
indonesia is one the most countries the the 
the is important for the whole area that indonesia a stable democratic rule is with good relations within and outside asean
the european union must the democratic and the socioeconomic developments support but not inappropriate
we must conditions to the our aid and support
there must there are the progress in the process the human must improve the  the human must be tried the corruption must be fight and the power the the army must further be number
as not than must the aid if be suspended
further would the aid many more coordinated must be the european level
the  in  can the coordination the the take
we questions also in our resolution the the european commission to the tendency to follow
finally with all respect for the sovereignty the indonesia when the the deliberating the violence the the moluccas and   again  than must to us believe international action not be excluded
i objective the observers the the un in the crisis where the really need is but possibly also humanitarian aid
the murders must really put
certainly the murders the beleaguered militias and islamic muslims
what is otherwise the difference between government and the old 
we are very concerned and we expect a answer the the european commission the this developments
president like like i mrs maijweggen congratulate with its good report and thank for the happy cooperation
political stability and respect for the human and a rule are keys for economic restoration after the 
the is also a condition for reinforced cooperation between the european union and indonesia
behalf the commission industry shall i i to three points
we are concerned on the large extent the corruption and tolerance in the indonesian economy
to many members the the former changes families have still still the power in hands
this is a large obstacle for economic restoration and social stability in the region and must therefore tackled to be
two restructuring the the private sector in indonesia is essential
the agency for the restructuring the the indonesian banks the socalled  has there to now to not for can ensure that the  again loans can provide
also has the  large financial interests in different companies
the few companies is they even the only 
this companies must privatised to be
that would same new opportunities create for foreign investment the as need are
my last point the economic relations with indonesia are now based the the 
the countries have to far little progress made the the economic integration although already years the about on a creating the a trade between the members
therefore asking the commission industry a bilateral cooperation to the between the european union and indonesia
i question the commissioner patten to this possibility together with are mr lamy to into
mr the president the the outside doubt that the in indonesia positive developments have occurred the us invite the links with this country the to to and a effective cooperation the to launch
the content the the communication the the commission the beginning this year is therefore completely justified although they doubt the result the the mentioned changes demonstrated the the only euphoria
in   rising the tension under more by the commitment the repressive methods also the situation the the moluccas and in  late to wish on to still but to silent the the dramatic situation in the camps the violently
there be not adequate measures affected to the change to to and the militias can still still unpunished their the to to matters the disaster have certain military forces from the former  the clearly relations with fundamentalist and nationalist movements maintain still always on a enormous margin and strong pressure
therefore precisely must the initial optimism that clear to expression is in the communication the the commission us to give vote and somewhat be  the there not doubt that the cooperation with indonesia must be strengthened
this must we the indonesian authorities to support the the improvement the the administrative procedures the fraud and the fight against the corruption the promotion the the system the enforcement and protection the the environment and the humanitarian aid the displaced and refugees this cooperation must however on be the the the real progress the the solution the the regional problems and the this however methods the respect the the human and the contribution the indonesia the the positive development the the  the timor people
in this the must a solution to be sought for the problems which the refugees the violently be faced also the trial and condemnation the the members the the militias the the the crimes have guilty made and recently still three officials the the united nations have killed are a absolute condition
the report the our mr maijweggen the moreover particularly good with the situation know is is whole in this line the deserves than also our unconditional support
mr the president mr the commissioner gentlemen colleagues in the first place wish i mr maijweggen to congratulate with the excellent work that they has done
the process the indonesia must to gentlemen be estimated and deserves our support
the events in violently forms a essential part the this process but same give they also expression the the contradictions the this positive development undermine
after the acceptance the the right the selfdetermination in the period between the forthcoming and the recognition the the demand result have armed militias existing from indonesian military systematically the public infrastructure and thousands housing   and  destroyed and the population terrorised the in panic to the bergen and violently is fled
if member the the delegation the this parliament i i the process if international observer the the footing can follow i was by the the  the the selfinterest people but same had i the impression that there if the bad would end not stone the the other would be left
such contradictions are still still present in indonesia they the the the moluccas in  in   or also now still in violently
the responsible for the crimes in violently the the now the unpunished territory are are still still not tried
the is completely unacceptable that they by a recently following law the the court can escape
in violently who more than thousand refugees the if human  be used by the moral and material perpetrators the the in violently capability criminal facts
i i the mentioned camps this year visited
this are the perpetrators the the crimes and the testify
the health the trial and the existence the the camps ensure for disagreement between the old and new indonesian authorities and are a clear proof the the equip the the process
this week still blocks high officials the the  serious risk when they the indonesian parliament in  leaving after a maintenance with the president
we can the process support and we do that also but we can not the place the the protagonists the this process adopt
president indonesia struggling but is over
the revolution in the country and the way which they place continue the basis for careful optimism
but the excellent report the mrs maijweggen makes time clear that the problems the indonesia earlier are to than are has
the is the country not unique
this problems are because characterise for a country that a multiple  must currently
the must a new identity develop with a better balance between centre and periphery
in the economy must the market the from the farreaching  and new investment attract
the  is urgent
the a hybrid society must a transparent made be
the corruption must be tackled
this can the eu the help by european companies the to speak
old structures must to be  so indonesia last over the itself can to
many topical problems be caused by lack the democratic control the example parts the the army the the oppose against change and against loss the privileges
the many places prevails the violence the dialogue
the most worrying is that the the moluccas where jihad the unacceptable way their the can to
the government in  would many more must do to over to to the the situation the ground and the eu must the necessary pressure continue exercise also if expression the the greater responsibility the the european union for the region must take
when this to little result would that than should we a active role the the international community not out
the a again functioning rule one also the mission with the past
the process very slow
the old structures oppose the against the necessary justice
they are because in many cases complicity the crimes
we questions and demands that guilty be effectively and be tried or the now is to the family  or to the who the the dutch journalist  
the relations between indonesia and the eu can only further improve if we know that our partners this also really authority represent and that the rule to properly work
president the encourage the  are still long not obliterated in indonesia
the influence the the military is the reduced but still still many to large
the corruption those still making
persistent violence the the moluccas in  and in   to large suffering under the population
president wahid and vicepresident sukarnoputri have still little  can show
the is the large important that europe the economic and democratic developments in indonesia supports
but this aid is not deserve mrs maijweggen said that also already
they must the good to the poorest population
the rights must stop  must be effectively and especially the prosperity must many better be divided
the is very difficult to the huge rich meet to the
the time that a few  this could is fortunately over
but bad administration which military secondarily their disastrous the can to encourages the 
the cause the the conflict the the moluccas is especially in the want  the  which the  was balance
the situation the this islands remains alarming
only when a impartial army intervene is there opportunity the peace
the international community must  maximum under pressure to to a end to make the the violence the the moluccas
there must more humanitarian aid the be
that applies also for echo that this moreover excellent work done
also   is the victims the the 
here the the local population also frustrated by the immigration the muslims and the hard action the the military
the is the the the important that the guilty the the rights their punishment not but
i join i the the my colleagues the questions to a immediately judicial research to the murder the  
mrs maijweggen has a excellent report written and i from than also that europe everything must do to the country to support the way to the democracy but the is end the the  itself to the encourage the the regime the  from to remain
mr the president gentlemen colleagues there are us two important events to wait
tomorrow the here the sakharov prize
i remind you remind that this price last year the president xanana xanana was sent
we have here when tribute the the the commitment the courage and the exemplary behaviour the the selfinterest population
in february the this year has the commission a new political initiative for indonesia developed that we here also have discussed
to my sorry must i say that we the somewhat rush to work are has
i say this to my sorry because also i course would had had that the affairs in indonesia otherwise were got
we have indonesia in all urgency the benefit the the doubt whether and also i had wanted that we this a positive answer had been
unfortunately is this year clear become that this not the case is
as our mr maijweggen here already in its introductory words has stressed the i moreover together with its report the full endorse reductions the situation in indonesia
we must from learn draw and clearer unequivocal and  signals the indonesia broadcast
i i is indonesia a large country the is the however the a crossroads and the depends the the international community and the the european union the or indonesia final for the democracy the respect the the human and the rule will choose in place the the chaos to let mechanistic
the is therefore important that we priorities to environmental social affairs and economic issues should not the one line be the with the problem the the respect the the democracy and the human that within our relations with indonesia from political view a priority emphasised must are
i think hand also that we a clear signal must give because we otherwise the risk are a policy with two speeds to to as the we make the criticism but we act there not to
we must the moreover objective experience the this year use to indonesia clearly clear to make what our expectations are
mr the president the rapporteur mrs maijweggen the clear the where the problem political problem in indonesia
they as the  the the fundamental and them process the  downright the particularly
the whatever in its report rightly still very strong
the on the the recent reports from the indonesian  urges the however the question the or the situation still not more yes   for  and his  than the rapporteur analysis
a an wear yesterday the situation in the dig the  together with the sense the  blocked and the  redeemed the  creating steadily
stagnation the the  change still not that the way to a democratic rule i quote the rapporteur really 
therefore must precisely now the european union the democratic forces the or many or strong are to ability careful to support
given the historic burden the the two contemporary indonesian areas upon the moluccas and   would only already unpunished and western understanding for the harrowing  compromise many political tension and pain fears
here is definitely a common task
ray is the was that i the the  indonesia reached
from the christian churches to this despite insecure times vote the the questions to 
way the the work the the own  and sympathy show with the closest also the muslims from the love the borges the  for the whole sometimes as countries 
mr the president my congratulate the mrs maijweggen for its excellent report
i know that they many know on indonesia and with particularly on the moluccan community in netherlands
the position the we must adopt the regard the the territorial integrity the indonesia is simple we must us the the the international legislation and the resolution the in december by the united nations is adopted
in the resolution the explicitly that   part part the indonesia
this is something which already our countries the agreement have declared black the white and they have than also the duty to the this to the
this recognised the community that the vote in   to final part from to make the indonesia here was been and the was a  the the in by the united nations adopted statement which any act the banned the at is the the partial or overall such the the national unity and territorial integrity the a country
the situation in   is legal and constitutional completely otherwise than the situation the east
the parliament must this two not with other confuse
  has historic given always part member the indonesia
east never
therefore must the right the crucial give
course must we that ensure that indonesia remains continue with the persecution the members the the security the accused are the violation the the human as not  than 
any intervention the outside except support for the process and the enforcement the the law can only but if counterproductive be given and will oil the the great bear
no will if winner from the fight to if we us  up
i use that floor deliberate
what we in the european parliament and the eu can do is the new democratic indonesian government to questions to not already to own to respond
if they that the does plays they the  in the card and be terrorists  and wideboy
what we also with immediate commit can do is massive support to give the projects in indonesia the under sound administration are support in terms the human money humanitarian aid the the the standards and criteria so the  administrative structure the now by president wahid is approved the founded with sustainable democratic and social institutions
if we indonesia want help must we now act with money and action and not only fine words speak
mr the president i join i the the the words the my two colleagues both what the content the the report if the congratulate the the to the mrs  the also i congratulate its realism and especially its faith the the values and principles the our european union
i eight the fundamental that we the the the the the cooperation with indonesia ensure the the respect the the values and the creation the a rule
